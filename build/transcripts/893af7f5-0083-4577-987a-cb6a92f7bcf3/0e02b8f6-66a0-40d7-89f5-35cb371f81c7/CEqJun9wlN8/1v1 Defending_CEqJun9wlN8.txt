is something I do with kids something I did with the professional teams do with Real Salt Lake we do this with um New York Red Bulls right now and some of it it seems like it's all the stuff that we've all done but a lot of the things are the emphasis the emphasis of what we're looking for and at the end of the day for me team defending is all about defending in twos and an understanding between the first and second Defender and those situations occur all over the field so what we're going to do is kind of a progression into working together thinking together thinking in twos uh making play predictable for the Defenders uh you have to give something and take something away when you're defending and so if we can get the group to start to think about what we're going to give them space in front of us isn't so dangerous space behind us is very dangerous okay if they're allowed to continuously play in the middle of the field and they have many options can we get them close to the sideline if we get them close to the sideline then the field they have to play in is much smaller makes it tougher for them okay so this session is going to be a progression starting with individual defending principles principles of Defending in groups in twos and then we move to this game that's very much about taking away what we think is dangerous giving them what we think is acceptable and then being able to close them down so real simply it's just going to start off with 1 V1 defense ending we've all seen it I'll just talk these guys through a little bit of what we're looking for as we go okay so first player just plays out the attacking player receives it and is trying to dribble over this line to score off you go good keep it wide keep it wide perfect he always knew he was going this way so he was going to win it there ready go close quickly give yourself some time good good patience good patience don't let him out of this side don't let him out of this side plenty of options to keep him over here or plenty of times you could have kept him over good keep him here as soon as you start to let him out your feet get crossed up then it's hard to recover knew that was going to happen as well so hang on one sec just things to think about yes we want to give up go ahead play it out to him yes we want to make sure we make things predictable but the worst thing we can do is allow them to get behind us so this is is can happen so for us it's about being able to slow them down once we slowed them down then we're going to make sure we take our angle and try to force them to the sideline so the worst thing that we can do is allow them to go straight through a straight run a straight pass these things can't happen we have to stop forward progress first stop forward progress then make it predictable ready go close CL once you once they start to go sideways is when we got to close them down they're not dangerous again good wanted to go the other way couldn't go the other way off you go can't let her out let her out the side got one side you got to keep her on that side got to go with your arm you had him in a good spot there keep him on the sideline there then if he gets out keep them on the sideline there we want to reduce the space that they play in good once they slow down is when we can actually get to them arms up arms up okay and hold so let me have the ball please couple of things to think about couple of things you want to be telling your players recognizing that go ahead come start come toward me okay the second he slows down I've taken away a little of his Advantage now I can actually start to think about how I'm going to get to it just start to go that way as soon as he's not going forward this is a time where I can close space because he's not dangerous now he's not facing forward this is when I can start to close these are the opportunities we have to look for and recognize and then as he tries to poke it by we've got to make sure that we're strong we go with our arms go with our bodies go with our hips okay we've caught people in good spots here and they're able to get out because we don't go real strong okay but the keys are recognizing when you can go and those times are when they're slowed down they don't have momentum anymore if they're not going straight forward and they're actually going at an angle or to the side we can get closer okay I've seen a lot of times here where they slow down and already we're kind of our distance Remains the Same you got to make that distance smaller when they slow down ready go times you can close look for times you keep them on the sideline there then let him go side to side okay next one go good slow down now hard now hard got to anticipate recognize when he can't go back to the right he's got to go that side keep him over here good good awareness now close now close good out of bounds well done go get him close to a sideline can't dive can't dive got to be patient create that little box we talked about you want them to get into a little box where they can't get out got to slow down forward progress slow him down good step step step perfect well done excellent again recognizing moments where he can go close close can't let him out can't let him out good way to stay with it next one go arms up well done much better close the space a little can't let him out though got to create that box we're we're so close so many times and we've got players in good positions but you have to recognize the times that you can go go can't dive good move can't dive keep him toward the sideline again this angle that we take we're trying to create a box where what as they come in there's really no way they can get out and that's when you know you can close really quickly good arms up little bit of anticipation defensively good well done can't let him out of that side okay hang on one sec okay so when try obviously if you sit here and you do One V one things like this it can get repetitious for them can get boring uh try to make it into a game where maybe I'll go for two minutes and count the number of times they get over the end line and then flip it around and the other team does it and create some sort of competition that way that certainly keeps keeps the interest up uh certainly with the younger ones all right you guys go ahead and flip it friend okay so this time again the key principles are we've got to be able to slow down forward progress right so we've got to be able to slow down forward progress I close them down I keep them in the side that I want to go as soon as he starts to go then I want to be able to get tight you have to anticipate when he's actually going to go and able to step and get tight so there's a little bit of of anticipation involved but it's really very much about slowing them down making them start to go the way you want okay we'll go a couple more minutes we'll switch around we'll do a couple different things ready go okay hang on so again just this thought process you came out you had in your mind you came out and you had it in your mind you're going to keep him on this side if he comes running and he's now closer to this sideline what do you think you should do keep on the sideline we're just trying to take away whatever Advantage the attacker has okay off you go good patience don't let him out off you go got to keep in the side you want to keep them okay way to stay with it go make sure we can force a player into a side this seems so basic at the moment but if individual defending principles aren't right then you can never defend as a group slow down well done that's it he slows down he slows down you get close enough to poke well done hard now good good with your body keep him there good too straight on too straight on he's got too many options force it one side good all right decent reaction okay and hold it so now you're going to send two attackers one Defender okay so obviously this is a difficult situation for the defender but our choices are again we don't want anyone to get behind us so if we dive in can wait please if we dive in to the player who has the ball and he can play it behind me now I've not slowed him down at all and more you can slow teams down the better it's going to be for you defensively so go ahead so we want to take up a position where I discourage the past so at least in my mind I know that he's probably going to go in there listen you're going to lose most of these two verses one you're going to lose most of them but if you can slow it down and make him have to make a decision and make him slow down in the real world that means you get players behind you if I dive in in the game and this player gets played in he's off to goal and there's no way anyone else is going to recover so the whole idea defensively is we want to make sure we slow down their forward progress which eventually allows us to get players behind the ball
