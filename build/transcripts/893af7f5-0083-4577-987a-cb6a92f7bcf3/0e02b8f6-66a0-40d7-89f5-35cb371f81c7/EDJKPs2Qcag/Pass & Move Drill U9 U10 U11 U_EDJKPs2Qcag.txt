hi everyone it's important that younger players understand the benefits of moving after you pass a ball so here are two variations is pass and move drill from u9 through to u12 [Music] this drawer can be set up any way that you wish in our example here we have a rectangle but the current is just 10 yards apart from each other and how the drill works you'll make sure there's one more cone compared to players in this example five players has six cones and quite simply the player will play a ball to their teammate and then run to that free cone [Music] be sure to encourage communication and accurate passing and speed of play in this drill you can also progress this variation just by adding one touch passes a second variation or progression from this drill will be a one two or a wall pass so a player plays it into one player on the cone gets it back then finds a pass and then finds that free cone [Music] this progression encourages the players to be a bit more aware of what's going on to make sure they go to the free cone and not to the current they previously left [Music] so there's a simple passive moves drill for ages u9 through to u12 remember you can change this and set up any way that suits your team best have fun and good luck [Music] you
