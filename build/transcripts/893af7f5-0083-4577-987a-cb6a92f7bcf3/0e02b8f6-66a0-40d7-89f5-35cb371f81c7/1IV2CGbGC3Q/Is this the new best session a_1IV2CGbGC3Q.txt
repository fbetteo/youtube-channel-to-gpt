hey guys today we're going to talk about something new that I've been doing called battle boxes and it's going to change the way that you run your training sessions so let's go so for those of you who follow the channel for a while I think you know I like to start my training sessions with small-sided activators so 2v2 3v3 just as they're coming to training with small pug goals well I haven't been very happy with how that's been going in my training sessions really for a while the kids come to training and they goof around and they're smashing balls and they're not really using that small-sided activator in the way it was intended which really is to replicate freestyle street ball pickup ball encourage creativity encourage 2v ons encourage 1 V ones so I found something a lot better now I'm calling them battle boxes but they actually come from a guy named John korus and I'm going to link um some of the stuff that that he does and the team at 343 but I'm a huge fan of 343 soccer um I'm a member um I've also subscribed to Jona corus's 7v7 course so I'm going to share some of these battle boxes and I call them battle boxes he calls them battle rondos um it's a little bit of a semantics thing I just don't think they're rondos but it doesn't really matter U the point is that these are going to give you the repetitions of 1 V one 2v ones that you're looking for and get your players comfortable with the ball in tight situations the initial setup for your battle box starts with four cones in a square in the size that you would do a normal Rondo the size of your battle box just like the Rondo will be very much dependent on the age of the player and the skill level the older teams and the more skilled teams having smaller boxes and the younger and less skilled teams having larger boxes you will also notice that I have two cones situated just outside the square Orange orang cones here and they are of different color and those will be used in certain types of battle boxes that you'll see in a minute so the number of battle boxes that you're going to set up is going to be dependent on the number of players you have at practice in my experience it's really best to have no more than six to maybe eight at the most players per battle box you really want your players to get the maximum number of 1 V1 2V1 situations available for them here you can see a setup of two battle boxes side by side so this would really be ideal for 10 to 12 players in this setup I would recommend that the coach stand in the middle of both battle boxes and that way you can coach both sides here's a picture of this setup on the pitch I've set this up uh waiting for players to come to training and you can see there's two battle boxes side by side the basic 1v1 battle box starts as shown with a single Defender in the center and attacking players all with balls lined at cones opposite each other the attackers go 1 V one against the defender within the battle box attempting to dribble across opposite Gates the 1v1 battle ends when either the attacker successfully dribbles through the opposite two Gates or the defender wins the ball or gets a quote steal as we call it we leave the defender in the box and they go side to side defending each line differently until they get to a preset number of defensive steals so you could play till five steals till three steals whatever the level of your players if the player dribbles the ball out of the box or takes a Bad Touch that's also considered a steal you also have to make sure that the player on the opposite line doesn't go too soon they can't cheat they have to let the defender come back into the middle of the Box before they restart the next 1v1 battle here's an example of this in a training session that I ran recently and you can see you've got these two side by side battle boxes now I've got another coach with me so I'm mainly on one side and he's on the other but like I said you could go right in the middle and uh and Coach both sides you're really going to want to coach as much as possible in the flow you know minimal minimal stoppages you want as much One V one activity going on so you want that person in the middle defending to get a lot of 1 V one opportunities again that defender in the middle gets switched out every five steals now if you have a player who's weaker you might have to switch them out yourself before they get to five steals otherwise they'll be in there defending forever so what are the coaching points for the basic 1V one battle box so let's start on the defensive side where the main coaching points are body shape and approach so the way that we approach Defenders fast slow side low we do not stab we front foot defend you have to be careful because they will jab with that front foot but sometimes they'll lean way too far so it it almost acts like a back foot defending where they get so much of the weight on one side it's easy for the attacker just to go right around them and lastly they want to close space so if that player is going to one side you want to push them towards that side close the space remember to tell them you don't always have to win the ball if you close that space down on the attacking side especially with the 1 V one basic the main thing is not showing them the ball so what you'll see a lot is for example right footed players will want to go to the left they'll take the inside part of their right foot and turn to the left and it just shows the defender the ball and it's easy for them to take usually if you want to go to the left you'll want to use your left foot the outside part of your left foot to keep the ball as far away from The Defender as possible or you'll want to use a move right you want to use a turn you want to use a cut something like that also I like to introduce this concept of two speeds so a lot of times you'll just see a player go one speed and try to beat somebody and I try to tell them listen when you have the ball you at some point have to use two speeds you have to trick them because the person without the ball is always going to be faster and eventually will catch you so for the next few battle boxes we're going to be using these outside cones now for the pass and receive one we're going to have one line of players at the top blue cone with balls and then you have a one line at the red cone without balls player with the ball starts the battle Box by playing a hard firm pass to the player at the bottom this initial pass is important because we want the player receiving the ball to have to work on their touch so without striking the ball and shooting you really want to encourage the player with the ball to play a firm pass into the other line once this ball is played in we again have a 1V one situation where the player with the ball is trying to get through the opposite gate and the defender is trying to close him down the battle ends if the attacker is able to get through the opposite gate or if the defender is able to win the ball steal the ball or push the player out of bounds with the ball it's also considered a steal or it's over if the player with the ball takes a real heavy touch we don't count that they have to keep it close to get cross the gate here I would play for a set period of time so you could do this for 3 minutes 4 minutes before taking a break or you could put the kids and teams and use a scoring system here this is in real time and again you really want to encourage that first pass to be firm cuz we want the attackers to be working on their touch and we want the Defenders if they see a poor touch to go right after them this should be a lot of like Fast Furious interaction right I like a little bit of chaos with this get them going as quickly as possible and keep keep them engaged so you want to do this for again maybe 3 4 minutes or you again you could put them into teams and kind of keep score sometimes that can be fun too all right so what are the coaching points for this battle box so starting on the defensive side this is when you're going to teach what are the triggers to press what are the triggers to know you can go after the ball first one is a Bad Touch so that's why we're encouraging a firm pass we really want to see if there's a Bad Touch will our Defender go right after the ball second is if the attacker's head is down right so if that head is down you go right after the ball lastly is if they turn their back like if they turn their back to you hey go make them pay go get the ball on the attacking side these are similar coaching points we don't want to show the player the ball we want to use two speeds the last battle box that we're going to go over today is the basic 2V1 the setup is similar to the 1v1 pass and receive where you have two groups on each of the outside cones one on the blue one on the red here one important note here is that in the group that has the balls the first person in line should not have a ball this player starts the battle off by running to one of the two far cones once that player touches the cone the battle begins with the attacking player with the ball coming into the battle box and the defender at the blue cone coming in to defend the player who touched the cone now comes in support and we have a 2V1 going to the opposite gate the battle ends if the ball is one by the defender or if the two attacking players are successful working together 2V1 to get through the gate the rotation goes as follows the player who touched the cone now goes to the defensive line the defender who just defended goes into the attacking line and the attacker who dribbled the ball into the battle box now goes to one of the two cones that are far from them touches the cone and starts a new battle here's us doing this live and you can see again we have the two side by-side battle boxes and this is our 2V1 basic really it's something that you have to encourage in terms of taking people on supporting and you've got to encourage the rotation that's one thing that the kids are going to struggle with a little bit but once they do get the rotation it becomes pretty straightforward and you can kind of get this going back to back to back and you're really creating 2V1 scenarios over and over again in a tight space so the coaching points on the 2V1 battle Bo we'll start defensively where really you're just trying to slow the ball carrier down and try to close space if you can do that when you're defending 1 V2 in general you're just trying to slow them down on the attacking side this is a great opportunity to introduce support so that player who's coming in support should be at the level of the defender a lot of times they'll stay too high and the defender will come down there's no support and then the angle just never materializes the other big concept here is breaking lines if the defender does not come and engage there's no reason to play that support person cuz you're not going to break any line and lastly communication so the player in support should be talking to player with the ball telling them carry carry carry pass pass letting them know what's in front of them as they dribble the ball so guys when it comes to these battle boxes you can do a variety of things you can do them with throws you can add goals to the outside I have a bunch of them that I've created myself this is really just to give you a frame work but I really like these better than the small-sided activators because it gets you 1 v1s 2 v1s and it's in a really tight so it allows the players an opportunity to get comfortable so when they're in the game in a tight space it's not so overwhelming guys I hope you like that video if you have any
