If I take you into a gymnasium and you've never trained in your life and I put you through a normal workout with barbells for example, both lifting and lowering, doing positive and negative work, then you can expect to become, if you work hard the first time, now mind you, this is the first time you ever trained in your life, you can expect to become very sore. Let's call that magnitude of soreness of 50 on a scale of 0 to 100. So the next day you will have uh maybe a level of soreness of 30. 2 days later you'll have a level of soreness of 40. 3 days later you'll have a level of soreness of 50. So you will become somewhat sore 24 hours after your first workout. Marketkedly sore 48 hours afterwards, marketkedly sore than that another 24 hours later. and then having reached a peak of 50 it will start to decline. 3 or 4 days later it'll be back to zero assuming you continue to train. Now that's the pattern with normal work which is both negative and positive. If instead you had done a negative only workout, then instead of being sore at a level of 30 24 hours later, you might have been sore at a level of 50 24 hours later, which is the peak that you reached previously after 72 hours. So you have gone higher faster than 48 hours after the first workout. 2 days later you might reach a peak of 60 or 65. While the soreness will be greater and while it will become it will come quicker. It will decline more rapidly. So that instead of staying sore for a week, you will probably be entirely over the soreness in about 4 days. Assuming again that you continue to train. Then you can forget the soreness. It will never come
