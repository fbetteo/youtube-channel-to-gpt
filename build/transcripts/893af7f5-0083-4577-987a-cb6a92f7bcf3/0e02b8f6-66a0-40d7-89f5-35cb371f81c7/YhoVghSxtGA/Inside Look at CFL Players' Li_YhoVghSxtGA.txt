parallel with the ground the entire time I want as much Hang Time as I can let's go one for distance power skips let's go next one we're going to going to go a skip for power so I want to see hip hyperextension right so I'm actually driving forward as I [Music] go good good we got B for power all you're want to do is when this knee meets hip level I release the hamstring and I pull it down I don't need a big kick out here and for your foot to land way out here that's not the pattern we're trying to learn we're trying to get the knee when the hip flexes for the hamstring to relax and pull down stay IND dorsy flexion pull it down all right fellas straight leg bounds I want to see big hip separation here right so when I go right I'm big pull bang bang bang and I'm focused on my glute let's go all the way down we're going to go alternating bound asell Focus I want you imagine the belt line that belt line is going to slide across this Turf parallel with the ground I'm going to focus rib cage slightly over pelvis chin tucked I'm going to focus on my knee driving forward long extension in the back so I'm here bang bang bang all the way down don't come vertical apply Force back down to the ground push forward punch that knee forward next series we're going to go through is going to be some neural work right so the first series we're going to go through we're only going to run through one of these a piece you're going to see two zones here we're going to start back from that line that hash mark back there so we're going to start from back here she's going to jog into it first one we're going to go through is going to be a high knee piston run so I want you to think lift with the hips right pop the thigh doesn't need to be the hip level pop the thigh and Strike Back Down Under underneath the hip the ball of the foot toes stay forward the whole time all right so just as a quick dry run I'm going to start from back here boom run up and then jog same thing again I want 10,000 steps in five yards let's go little higher little [Music] higher good next one let's go butt kick all hamstring all hip coordinate your hip and your hamstring together to collapse and come down same time 10,000 reps every five yards same thing we just did let's go let's go pop the thigh pop the thigh string turn on make that HST string turn on let's go that thigh pop forward a little bit higher a little bit higher so now it's going to be high knee butt kick what's the demand I want to see this knee get the hip level I want to see this heel get to this butt so before I was allowing you guys to pop the thigh where you want now I want your knee to hip level knee to hip level same thing let's go pick it up and put it down don't step over yet pick it up and put it down good good knee higher knee higher knee higher knee higher knee higher all right now we're going to go step over run I'm performing a rapid cycle like I'm pedaling a bicycle I'm just simply stepping over my opposite knee so I Collapse like we just did high knee butt kick right at the top my lower limb releases by relaxing the hamstring and comes down so it's the same thing I just did but now I'm just stepping over the opposite knee so I'm just here all the way down yes sir control pull over all that was your neurl now we're going to focus on the push and acceleration right we're just going to go fourway half kneeling starts so what I want to see we're going to get down on the line we're going to go three at a time knee comes down from here draw your chest over your thigh chin tuck opposite hand to opposite cheek right cheek to cheek here I want chin Down Eyes down at your feet and I want you to push off and explode in that positive trajectory that Shin's going to take you there focus on this leg right here being able to push you in that direction okay so I'm right here push and drive off chin tuck eyes down we're going to go one each side and then we're going to go one lateral we'll come back and do one more on the other side so we're going to go a total of four total of four one each knee and then one each side laterally let's go to [Music] work [Music] now let's have a little fun first guy you're going to go on the right side of this Cone first guy over here on the left side of this cone we're starting back on the right knee starting back on the right knee when you guys
