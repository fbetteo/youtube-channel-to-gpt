hi everyone in this video i'll show you a simple dribbling drill you can use to improve your clothes control when you're dribbling with the ball so to set up for this drill we're going to need two different color cones and as you can see here we have two lines of blue cones and down the middle there's a line of yellow cones and the blue cones are about three yards apart from each other and the yellow cones are situated in the middle of each blue one [Music] so for this drill you're going to zigzag from blue cone to blue cone but when you approach the yellow you will perform a skill move so the first one we're going to show here is inside to inside [Music] so a simple inside of the right foot inside the left foot and same on the way back [Music] the second variation is rollover so as you approach the yellow cone roll your foot across the top of the ball be sure to use both feet [Music] number three is inside to outside as you approach the yellow touch with the inside and then touch it again with the outside to go past the yellow cone and remember the inside and outside touch are performed with the same foot [Music] and number four is roll over to outside so as you approach the yellow cone roll your foot across the top of the ball then use that same foot to use the outside to knock it back from the direction you just came from [Music] moving to number five is the v turn so as you approach the other cone knock the ball level with a cone and then drag the ball back and then around the other side of the cone [Music] finishing up with number six is a step over so as you approach the other cone perform a step over one foot then use the outside of your other foot to knock it past the cone [Music] so there you go six variations from the simple drill that you can use to improve your dribbling remember this drill focuses on having close control of the ball so be creative with your touches have fun and good luck
