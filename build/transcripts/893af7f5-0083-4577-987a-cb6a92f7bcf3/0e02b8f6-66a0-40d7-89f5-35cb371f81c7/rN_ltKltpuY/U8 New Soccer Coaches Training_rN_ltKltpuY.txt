okay hi i am brian hoffmann i've been coaching a Wiseau soccer for about five years the last four years I've been coaching a lot of the ages sixes and sevens and so we have five on the field in this age group and I'm putting together this video series to help new coaches who don't have any experience coaching soccer and the reason is because you will have a lot of videos available to you that will show you how to do different types of drills so in practices you can be doing passing shooting dribbling drills but I want to spend some time teaching you how to control your team teach them how to move as a unit how to not bunch up and this is gonna pay handsome dividends this is a very exciting age group so at ages six and seven the tendency of the kids is to bunch together okay they like to swarm around the ball like a bunch of bees so you're going to be fighting that the whole season and the way that you beat this is by teaching them in practices you know yelling at them all the time spread out you know go forward move back like doesn't work very well in the middle of a game but if you invest time in them during the practices and teach them how to hold their formation how to move as a unit then they will be able to by the end of the season you will see your team beginning to spread out stay in their position move the ball around and actually start winning some games so it's a very rewarding age group because you see at the beginning of the season they tend to bunch and then by the end of the season they are spreading out holding their positions and moving as a unit and moving the ball around the field and it's very exciting so I want to teach you what I have learned over the last three or four years and here we go so if Tennessee is going to beat a bunch up around the ball okay and we want to avoid that so the way that I do this is I teach my kids how to use a star formation okay so that looks like this or the blue team okay we have one midfielder so what I do at this age group is I introduce the midfield position okay look at the blue team okay we're gonna have one midfielder in the center of the team okay he's the heart of the team the captain of the team the strongest player on the team okay he's soccer smart he's alert he's paying attention to what's going on alright and he's got good ball control skills he can also run a lot doesn't get tired so strongest player right here in the midfield position then we have two forwards and two defense this is how I like to play with this these kids when I have five on the field look at the orange team right now okay they've got three forwards and two defense okay you can do that you could also do three defensive two forwards some people would argue don't introduce the midfield position and it's age group but I disagree this formation seems to work the best for me okay the reason that is because the midfielder is my strongest position okay my strongest player the ball is naturally gonna want to gravitate towards the center of the field at all times so we want to put our strongest player here because he's gonna touch the ball more than any other player okay these guys right here the orange team they've got a hole in the middle okay who was supposed to get the problem is right now who was supposed to go in the middle okay alright when the ball is there who was supposed to go towards it well they all will okay that's no man's land okay if you have three defense it's the same problem you still the hole in the middle of the field so whenever the ball gets kicked in the middle of field no one knows what to do what happens they all swarm around the ball like a bunch of bees and we want to avoid that so that is why we teach our kids okay there's one midfield he controls the center of the field that's his job okay all right these guys are forwards these guys are defense they need to stay in their position okay don't gravitate towards center of the field so that seems work pretty good for me now well we don't want to do is have a goalie all right so no goalie this is a tendency that I see happening in this age group some parents some coaches okay like do it like this okay they might have one goalie to defense and two forwards and that's fine but the problem with this is that when the ball gets kicked down the field okay then get these four players they will move up the field like this okay alright and this guy stays down here now the advantage of this is that he protects the net and in the event that the orange team gets a breakaway okay he can protect the net and keep it safe and prevent them from scoring so that is a good advantage okay but the disadvantage is this is that this guy is now disconnected from his team okay he's of no value he's not supporting his team he's not helping his team and actually this team is outnumbered right now because they got five guys here all right all right so the Laurence team is going to get the ball and they're going to move the ball forward because they have more players okay probably most of the time just with numbers they're going to do that well we want to do instead is we want to avoid that from happening we want to get this guy up here in the middle okay because we want our team to stay connected okay these are the things we're trying to teach our team okay we want to teach them to stay connected and move as a unit it is more important to teach your team to stay connected and move as a unit than it is to have one guy disconnected from the team staying down here and preventing the other team from scoring on breakaway goals now if you do this and you teach your team to move us unit and stay connected and move up the field together the orange team is going to naturally sometimes get some breakaways and they're going to score an open net that's going to happen okay so don't get frustrated when that happens because you have to weigh what's more important what is more important is it more important to teach your kids to be isolated from the team disconnected and protect the net and have the other team score less goals or is it more important for you to teach your kids to function as a team to move as a unit okay and stay connected together I believe it's the latter that's more important okay by the end of the season you will see your team controlling the ball more moving the ball around more okay actually winning more games if they can do this the other thing is that at this age group we don't have a goalie okay we have small nets and we have an arc around the net so you're not allowed to enter into the arc until the ball does okay so so we don't want anybody playing goalie okay they can't use their hands and that's not gonna be standing in front of that anyways so we want it's more important to teach them to play their positions okay now the advantage of this is well let's back a little bit well I do the star formation in practice okay I will show them this on the whiteboard okay I call it the star because it's got a center and it's got four points to the star it's important for them to stay connected to one another they should be close enough to each other so that they can pass the ball they should be spread out as far as possible because we want to control as much of the field as we possibly can so they should be spread out as far as possible but not too far one guy should never be way over here disconnected from his team he's got no value he's not helping the team out okay so we always want to be close enough together where we can pass the ball to each other so I will draw this for them on the whiteboard and help them see it but then the next thing is in practice I will go and put five cones on the field in the position where I want them to stand okay I will place them in a position where I feel they're far enough apart from each other that it's a challenge to pass but they could still pass the ball to each other even these guys should be able to pass the ball back and forth to each other okay all right so that all if you have the ball yeah you always have options I can pass it to this guy or this guy or this guy that's what we want to do we want to create some space we want to create options so the best way to do that is star formation now in practices I will put five cones on the field force them to stand there and then they will just pass the ball around I might even give them two balls and they would just pass the balls around just holding their position and then I might move this star formation slide over here so we can do some corner kicks or some throw wins but no matter what is happening in the game we are always in this star formation and I get the kids you know used to you know passing the ball around with cones in those spots and then eventually I'll remove the cones and I'll kick the ball down the field and I'll tell them to hey I want the midfielder to go get the ball and stay there and stop and then I want that rest of the team to gather around him in the star formation so they get used to you know spacing themselves out okay without any cones for point of reference what the advantage of doing it this way is all I have to do really is once they've learned the star formation okay I have to teach my midfielder where to stand on the field so if I can control him and I can invest time in him and I can teach him where he needs to be the rest of the team will build themselves or space themselves out around wherever he is so I can place him on the field at any time in the game I can tell him hey Joey I want you to stand right here or I want you to stand right here I want you stand right here and then the team will build themselves around him because he knows where to stand or I will be able to tell him where to stand and then the advantage is I'm not telling five kids where to stand you know Sammy you got to go backwards and Fred you got to move to the left and you know Todd you got to move forward spread out no I don't to do that all I have to do is tell one midfielder where he needs to be you know you need to be right here or here or here and then I tell the team set up your star formation and they all will be referencing you know the midfielder if they look to him under the defense no they should be behind him and the forwards no they should be ahead of him okay so that is gonna make your life much easier if you can teach them to use the star formation introduce the midfielder invest in him okay and then teach these kids to stay connected and move as a unit okay that's it for video number one and there will be a couple more videos in this series thanks for watching
