well what we've got is will be a young group of players here mainly most of them are 15 16 years old so we've adapted a little bit of a session which we would do a quoit regular with the Faustian boys as well and I think it's one of the parts of the game now which is is increasing and that is pressing so we're going to try and have a look at the boys in the pressing and how they do it how they approach play us and we'll go through it in different sections we'll do it first of all we'll do it's a warm up we'll take it enter your secondary game and then we'll take it into something at the end and hopefully we get rewards and in doing it I think the modern game knows got so much where teams are building from the back and pulling from the back but I think that's proof to see that if you win the ball back here early and you win it in the opposition's half you score more goals and you'll get a better chance of success and I think it's a big part of the game no Wistar development in people playing more defensively and bringing the ball from the back I think it's also keen that you train when it from the front so we'll try and get that with a boys to do it today I'll feed the ball into one of you it could be either one your job is to score a goal and the other goal and it means that if you're the opponents of the ball gets fed in there as quickly as you can go up to the ball and put your brakes on and make sure that you're not going to get beaten so we don't want you to run up fast and sell yourself when he walks up and he beats you because that would be too easy and in the same breath I don't want you to stand to stay there I don't want you to stand ten yards off on because no he can pass the ball past you because the next games are going to be very much about what I would says you're not going to allow the ball to get played forwards so for me to stop the ball getting played forward I need to get in course an opening for for what's to come in the person was just to give the young players an understanding of getting up to the ball and make sure they've got their body in the right position that they're not to be beaten running up to press the ball doesn't mean that you you just run up and somebody walks walks past you so it's really important to get the message right away for the next session that we do want them to get to the ball we want them to press the ball very quickly but they have to put the brakes on and learn not to be beaten now that's not just defenders that has to be forward players as well so it works for the whole team so we would use this as a small warm up a in a pre before we go into the next part of it pressing with the boys giving them a lot of understanding of what we're expecting from them as far as getting up to the ball and not be next to you ready play there you go good don't be beating well done youngster well done you beaten beating him up too fast well done don't waste the gold court Tate Tate good know what good don't let them fish you up well done very good steer good keep going and keep going well done don't let him beat you well done you two last ball there you go Dell our way around good don't be beaten don't be beaten come on need to what carbs okay well done can I just use you as an example here if you don't mind just to see there was a moment on I'll give you the ball fish cells are cool that's just theater that's fine there's a moment where you had them like that when you get like that then you're trying to keep on going that way he got a chance to turn and get background and look at you again try if you've gotten facing that gone again if you've gotten facing that way try and keep them going that way all the time you don't want them getting a chance to turn and play forward I'll beat you so try and make sure you stop them getting round and looking at you okay again who's the next - who's the next to plate hey that's a free-kick I wouldn't smile at it because you'll be getting boot - you begin to send off play good not again you're on again play good again don't pick the past you don't get past well because football ultimately is 1v1 you know it someday against you against your opponent you have to either beat your opponent you have to stop your opponent so I think simply it's a way of also getting the players in a mindset that they're prepared and ready to say I have to compete against my opponent you know this is not really a great deal to do if it's been tactically aware that the moment is getting your body position correctly not be beaten making sure that nobody goes past you you and ideally what we're taking their sentries we're trying to play where we stop the opposition playing the ball forward as much as we can or will limit the amount of change the opposition put the ball forward so the idea is that you go up to the ball and you try and hit the ball off your opponent or if not ticked off and you actually stop them playing okay however ready remember when you can get up to the ball you're just trying to stop the team playing forward you don't want to play in the small goals you want to get up close them down quickly move your feet don't be beaten easily I make sure and be aware that we may play a second bar a third ball depending on how it comes okay so you gotta be ready where it's gonna go of it's gonna break there yeah sure yeah up up no stand oh you're too far off them too far off from come on yeah yeah come on we'll do that again big fella yeah yeah stand back there I'll do this we hope you don't mind what go back go back a little bit the ball was play then you nearly come up when you only stood here with them it's far too far away from and you're also very straight on so better idea is when the balls played up to him up cause up and you would be better if you can be slightly after then staying squared because you're going to find it you're going to get beaten but the distance you are at the moment is not close enough to stop and plain and a bit of players then we'll play past you so you've got to be brave enough even though you're a bit taller you got to be brave enough to get up and attempt to be closer to the ball here let's hit that ball back off you okay there we go you're not again there up up closer good Stian don't go back don't go back stay don't need to your bike well done well done get on again you know and again good up again up again don't stand don't go back but no play on play on play on don't fish you well done keep playing keep playing well done good you went back everything he's got in the ball I'll just show you what you're doing every time gets the ball you get up and you're doing not and you'll actually wouldn't buy it before he moves so don't go back you don't need to you swarm down you try and make sure the distance gets shorter okay we're on again it seemed to seem to there yeah it up again good block block no come on play on play on he got you've got it last ain't not that ball always look you for the ball steer don't be beaten don't be beaten well done okay unchanged there yeah you know again good you'll feel good to know feel watch the ball no fell good oh don't get out of there don't feel little furl you're to take then you can't see the ball because you're to take you can't see the ball next Bowl there you go stand don't go back yet you don't need to your bike or move your feet and again you're on again yeah yeah good don't let him get past you need to move your feet a bit quicker last Bowl you're on again good don't let them out north Earl north Earl good you what it no we all done unrest you too well you [Music]
