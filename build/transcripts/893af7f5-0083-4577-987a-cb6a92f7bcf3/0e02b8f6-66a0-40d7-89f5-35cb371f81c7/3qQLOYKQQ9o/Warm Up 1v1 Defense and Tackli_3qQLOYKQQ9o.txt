switch and stop okay girls i need you to spread out more so you're not running into each other there's lots of space so you guys come this way you guys come over there you go there okay this is these are the things i'm looking for guys as the attackers coming at you you got to make sure you have good body position so as you back as you're going backwards make sure that you're on your toes in other words none of this not going back in your heels so one foot in front of the other shuffle your feet quick to shuffle your feet and as soon as i say switch then you go forward with the ball so you're going from defending to attacking and it's got to be quick you got it so now drill a little quicker a little more speed so that the defender has to go back quicker ready go switch switch switch switch okay and stop come here bring the ball okay now the other thing you have to be careful here guys what's your name if riley is dribbling at me hold it i don't want to be too close because if i'm too close she pushes the ball and she's gone and i don't want to be too far because she's got too much room so i want you to be close enough so that anytime you can step with your foot okay so dribble at me riley so this about this far switch let go right away yes too close too close back up back up switch right away yeah switch okay got it ready go switch switch switch and stop good job good job okay so what i'm looking for now is i want you the defender to try to stop the ball when you can so if riley's coming at me i want to do that i just want you to step in and stop the ball once you stop it i stop it for you go again so if i stop it you go again and then then i'll say switch you got it now when you step into the ball you have to change your momentum you have to step into the ball it's not leaning back you have to step into the ball and watch your head don't hit heads ready go switch switch switch switch and stop okay let me ask you guys when do you step into the ball players when do you step into the ball when they take a bad touch when else okay when you're ready to step right so you got to make sure you're ready to step if you're going backwards and you're going too slow you're not moving your feet you can't step forward so you got to be able to change your direction so you go from here and be ready to step okay let's do that again okay ready go switch switch okay and stop all right um come here bring the ball one of you all right look so we're going to do it just we're still warming up let's just work a little bit on tackling so the thing we're going to do what's your name again david we are going to tackle the ball at the same time we're going to meet the ball at the same time so there's a technique involved here so what i need you to do i want you to step meet the ball at the same time and hold the ball so we're going to do this here take a step back when i say go step meet the ball we're not trying to win we're just trying to hold it you got it be easy on me okay look at your attitude though you got to be ready to go you got to be ready to go ready go leave the ball ready go go okay so that's what i want you to do you communicate with each other make sure that your foot is locked make sure that your toes are up and make sure your body is behind it ready on your own go okay make sure that you're tackling by your ankle on your toes closer to your arm and sound these guys are too nice they're going like this i want to hear the leather or the plastic i want i want to hear the thumb i want you to hold the ball don't be shy okay you got to learn this so you don't get hurt okay so you got to make sure that you want to hold it for a second you got it but it's it's an attitude you got to go in there hungry so the ball here you go and you're not trying to win it you got to time it okay so due to right foot then two left foot two right foot to left foot ready okay you on your own that's good make sure the ball is dead good it's right to right left to left look at these two okay time good job now you got to be ready you got to be careful guys that you don't go in easy or the ball by your toes if you go in the tackle and you it's and you do that guess what's going to happen your knee it's not a good thing you got to have the ball by your ankle bump that's what you tackle okay so now we're gonna have a little competition so what's gonna happen now come on david i'll take you on dude so what's gonna happen is you're gonna go at the same time but now you want to win the ball so first you mean it and then you win it so let's just pretend like like we go ready go so we go here now we fight for the ball so now you win it two ways you tackle spin it over their foot spin it out or use your body and knock him off the ball okay on my command first meet him then try to win it don't try to win it first all right we're playing best out of five okay ready go okay that's good now guys you're too nice wait we don't want to come here i don't want to go here and then go ahead and take it and it's like oh it's okay if you want you got to win the ball so you so if the ball pops loose here get after it and win it you have to have possession okay ready i want to see who who can tackle the ball right to right left to left go that's it that's it hit the ball okay wait a minute we're doing it together ready right to right go yes fight for the ball good good good job okay one last thing guys when you go into the ball don't swing at the ball do you know what i mean by that what do i mean yeah it's not like a shot if you do that and the other person misses the ball it's not going to feel good it's like a layoff you're going in to lay the love lay the ball off hard do not swing at the ball okay ready actually take two steps back and now you really have to time it ready meet the ball first go yes i like it okay one more make sure you meet the ball first don't get there early or late get there at the same time ready go
