[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] when in doubt talk it out the game is gates passing here we're developing players passing and communication skills use cones to set up a rectangular grid and place pairs of cones arms length apart randomly throughout the space these are your gates divide your players into pairs each with a ball here's how it looks ready and begin let's go pairs dribble around the grid trying to score as many goals as they can by passing to each other through the gates until you call time keep it basic done well it might look like this players working together to move fluidly from one gate to the next if done not so well you'll know it when you see it and by the way that's okay practice makes progress coaches encourage players to tell their teammate where they plan to go next and to head there after passing while receivers direct their first touch towards their target remember pass and move soft touches work as a team simple passes coaching bliss [Music] [Applause] two four six eight what do we appreciate this game which we call numbers passing here we're working on passing and receiving skills teamwork and communication you'll need four cones to mark your space then assign each of your players a number this is their passing order jackson 6 xavier 7. here's how it looks on your call players jog around the space passing the ball from one player to the next in numbered order and ready one finds two player one passes to two two passes to three and so on until the last number receives it and passes the ball back to one restarting the cycle where's six good find seven good job keep it moving hey and we're back to one good once players get into a rhythm up the ante and add a second ball encourage them to talk and move so they can set up their teammates nicely done you can also add a goal and a rule that at the end of each cycle the last player tries to score then becomes the new number one each player then shifts their number down so someone new gets to score each cycle take a shot good job don't worry if players forget to jog between passes just remind them to keep moving which keeps this exercise dynamic and more closely mimics the actual game coaches done well the ball should never stop moving when they're receiving encourage players to position themselves to see as many players as possible opened up with their back to the edges of your grid and remind them to cushion the ball as it arrives to receive it softly then take their next touch to pass to their teammate remember keep moving [Music] open to your teammates cushion the ball when receiving they're all number one in our eyes let's play with some catalan elan this is barcelona a small sided game is a kind of scrimmage focused on developing a specific skill in this case it's passing and it's inspired by one of the world's best teams barcelona's famous style of teamwork often called tiki taka uses short one-touch passes to maintain possession use four cones to create a rectangular grid with a goal or pair of cones on each end line divide your players into two teams one in pennies you can play 3v3 4v4 or more and if you have an odd number you can make one player all-time offense here we're playing 4v4 here's how it looks players scrimmage without goalies players score by kicking the ball into the goal or between the cones below knee height but here's the twist players score based on how many passes the team completes before scoring a goal eight eight points for purple like this if a team completes eight passes before scoring they get eight points but if they miss the goal sorry no points there are no corners or throw-ins and if a ball goes out of bounds it's a kick-in play short rounds the team with the most points at the end wins the round 21 great job coaches this is meant to be fun give your team room to play and hold the feedback for the end or use this opportunity to observe sometimes the best coaching insights come from simply watching your players in action remember tight passes work as a team take the shot ain't no party like a tiki taka party why should rectangles have all the fun we're mixing it up in triangle goal game here we're working on passing and communication skills use four cones to create a rectangular space and use cones to place six foot triangles randomly throughout your space divide your players into pairs you'll need at least as many triangles as you have pairs give every pair a ball here's how it looks pairs move around the space trying to score goals by passing the ball to one another through a triangle just like that there we go game realistic keep moving keep moving after each goal they move on to a new triangle and continue scoring until you call time three two one and time good job boys play short rounds about a minute or two each encourage players to keep track of their goals then try to beat their own score the next round some players may hit the ball too short or too far others may stop the ball to take game the more practice they get the more fluid this game will become it's as much about teamwork as it is about passing we want players finding and moving towards their next goal right after they pass and letting their teammate know where they're headed coaches when players receive a pass encourage them to take their first touch towards their next target bonus points to pairs who communicate well literally they'll score more good pass remember work as a team communicate pass to score please don't pass on this game [Applause] here's a way to get the upper hand or foot it's called 3v2 to goal this game helps players learn to use an extra attacker to their advantage create a rectangular grid with a goal or pair of cones on one end divide players into two teams one in pennies starting on opposite end lines here's how it looks play three attackers initiate play from their end line and are met by two defenders who enter from the goal end the attackers work together to try to score nice shot caroline if defenders intercept the ball they can score by dribbling the ball over the end line when a player scores or the ball goes out of bounds new players rotate in and a new round begins switch we want the attackers to spread out not bunch together tell players to imagine an open hand instead of a closed fist this gives attackers more options with the ball when they're under pressure encourage attackers to dribble at the defenders like this to force the defender to commit to the ball and open up space to pass around them ooh just like that coaches these girls are really good if you're doing this with younger or less experienced players it might look a lot messier don't lose heart that's why you practice remember spread out dribble at the defender attack as a team simple soccer math 3v2 equals one goal what do you get when you cross keep away with an iconic spanish soccer club this is rondo 5v2 yes the game you thought you invented at recess was actually developed by fc barcelona and it helps players develop their passing and teamwork skills create a square with your cones arrange your players in a circle just inside your cones with five attackers on the outside and two defenders in the center give your defenders pennies to hold not to wear since players will trade positions often shifting and moving the whole time let's go here's how it looks it's classic monkey in the middle the attackers pass around or between the defenders who try to win the ball the idea is quick controlled touches the more the better but if a pass goes out of bounds or is intercepted the attacker who last touched it swaps places with a defender the best players in the world train with this game because it mimics what happens on the field passing in tight spaces quick thinking and cooperation keep track of consecutive passes and try to top that number as a team each round one two three four five love it coaches encourage your attackers to draw defenders in before passing defenders meanwhile should avoid lunging in for the ball remind them to stay balanced and communicate with their partner remember controlled touches short passes cooperation you'll be coaching barcelona in no time or not if one goal is never enough we've got the game for you this is five goal game here we're working on attacking skills and finding a new attacking path when the one you're on gets blocked use four cones to create a rectangular grid and use pairs of cones placed arm's length apart to create a goal in each corner plus a fifth goal in the center divide players into two teams one in pennies here's how it looks each side sends in an equal number of players you can play 3v3 or 4v4 here we go you play in the ball and whoever gets to it first is on the attack players try to pass the ball through any goal to a teammate to score doesn't matter which direction as long as it finds a receiver that goes for the goal in the center too this makes it extra tricky for the defending team they have five different goals to protect and the only way to gain possession of the ball is to intercept or steal it the attackers meanwhile have to adapt quickly to pressure by changing the goal they look to attack if turnovers aren't happening naturally play short rounds and switch roles to ensure all players get turns attacking and defending coaches teamwork is key here remind attackers without the ball to keep moving we want them finding open space near a goal so their teammate can find them to pass force 4. remember pass the score find open space find a new path now you know what every goalie's worst nightmare looks like [Applause] this game is too hot to handle it's called hotbox in this small sighted game we're helping players learn to switch the point of attack by putting a big ol obstacle in their way use four cones to create a rectangular grid with a goal or pair of cones on each end line then use four more cones to create a square in the center of your grid also known as the hotbox divide players into teams of three four or more here we're playing 4v4 here's how it looks players scrimmage without goalies players score by kicking the ball into the goal or between the cones below knee height there are no corners or throw-ins and if a ball goes out of bounds it's a kick-in there's just one hitch players can't enter the hot box only balls can pass through what does this mean attackers with the ball may find their path blocked by defenders with a touch line on one side and the hot box on the other giving them less room to maneuver the solution switch the point of attack by sending the ball to a teammate play five-minute rounds the team with the most goals wins the round coaches this is a great time to reinforce techniques you've introduced during practice like small group attacking but don't over coach the rules of the scrimmage naturally push players to solve problems on their own in a fun way remember heads up find a teammate keep out of the hot box seriously is it getting hot in here [Music] [Applause] it takes two to tango and six to play this is 2v2v2 keep away here we're working on passing receiving and transitioning quickly from attacking to defending create a square space with your cones for every six players divide them into three pairs in different colored pennies if you have them so it's the white group the purple group and the yellow group what we're gonna be doing now is two versus two versus two two pairs are attackers one pair defends here's how it looks the attacking pairs play keep away from the defending pair the goal is to keep possession of the ball for as long as possible what could go wrong oh right the defenders their goal is to steal the ball or force a mistake oh good defending when they do they replace the attacking duo that last touched the ball but the game doesn't stop during these transitions so the new defenders and attackers need to get into position asap move the ball spread the feel guys open up open up open up open up this mimics the quick transitions that happen in the actual game encourage players to look at their passing options before they take a first touch and receive the ball we want players to be strategic and pass quickly slow passes are easier to steal you can add a rule to limit touches to two or even one to make it more challenging coaches we want attackers positioning themselves to the side of the player with the ball so they can easily receive a pass defenders meanwhile should be talking constantly determining who is pressuring the ball and who is offering support remember quick transitions look at passing options maintain possession expect some controlled chaos emphasis on chaos [Music] sharing is caring except when it comes to ball possession this is 3v3 plus one keep away here players are working on ball control and passing while working as a team to maintain possession it may look simple but even the pros practice with this game because it mimics the fast pace and kinds of situations players encounter on the field set up a square of cones for every seven players divide players into two teams of three one in pennies the seventh player is neutral or all-time offense which means they help the team in possession of the ball at any given time here's how it looks attackers try to rack up as many passes in a row as they can without losing possession to the opposing team in other words they play keep away defenders meanwhile can intercept or steal the ball at which point the neutral player shifts allegiance and helps them keep it away from the other team if the ball goes out of bounds it's a turnover after about a minute have teams switch roles and play again you may see attackers crowding towards the ball like that we're looking for this spreading out with their hips open to the playing space to find their teammates while talking and working together to create more passing options coaches defenders can learn a lot here too encourage them to double up to apply pressure to the ball while the third defender tries to block passing angles remember spread out hips open work as a team you won't be able to keep your team away from this game [Applause] you
