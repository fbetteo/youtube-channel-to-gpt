hi I'm John band I'm the director of coaching for the Cherokee impact recreational program and today we're going to be working on some sessions that you can do with your youth sixes I P the ball uh number two is dribbling uh you know against pressure instead of away from pressure and then number three uh is going to goal okay so all the activities that we're going to do today are going to focus on those three things all right uh and so what I need from you guys mostly uh is to be able to be available on the outsides um for the first part of it to make sure the kids are not going out of bounds uh and then the second is you guys going to uh play some characters okay and when you play your characters make sure again that you're playing you're really getting into it right so it's don't worry about being slightly embarrassed I'm going to be the most embarrassing person out here so don't uh don't worry about yourself cuz I'm they'll notice me far more than what see okay thank you very much all right kids okay so if you can we're going to start we're going to start out here in the back there make it smaller it's hey guys come on in right here right here right here can I hold on to

bound that's the out of bounds that's right actually I tell you what put your balls right here make sure all your balls are kissing each other okay's her and we'll practice that really right now okay so the first thing I want you to do is I want you to go that hole right there and I want you to wave high to that F right over there ready and go high to that four right over there and then come on

do with it can you eat it no can you smell it yeah okay can you throw it with your hands no sometimes all right so what I want you guys to do is find your ball right now and I want you to dribble around here as fast as you can but don't go out of Bounce don't go out of bounds right back it again there you go there you go there you go and freeze oh I forgot to tell you one thing when when I say

a scream all right give yourself a big round of applause yay all right one more time now this time if your two balls run into each other look what I can do what can you do that is awesome easy if your two balls run into each other the balls don't want to run into each other it hurts them so whenever that happens you have to say ouch but you say it like this ouch okay so what happens when two balls run into each other they say good okay so you're dribble as fast as you can stay in bounds don't let your balls run into anybody else's if they do what do you say there you go fast as you can fast as you can you guys are doing an awesome job no run into each other oh that was close and freeze you guys are really good at this that's really good okay come on right back in here that's right back in

new ball new ball Kingston hurry guys run run it's right here go M [Applause] Go's back in hurry hurry come on here's another one eyes open eyes open look look oh out there go go come guys turn turn look look run no no no don't go okay at the end of every practice I'd like you to summarize what you did with the kids and what you want to do then is give your parents some homework to work with with their kids a lot of times kids only practice at soccer practice they don't practice at home because the parents don't feel comfortable doing it or they may not may not have uh uh time or know what to do so what you're doing is you're giving them some activities that they can do that are going to help the kids practice a little bit each day uh in a safe place of course uh but just make sure you have some uh summarizing activities with them and make sure that you uh have them do some work at home with uh dribbling not away from pressure but around pressure so a lot of times a natural inclination is to run away so what we're doing with our kids a lot of times is just trying to get them to uh uh pay attention to the uh um s to uh not be afraid to take somebody off right you guys are big and scary and they did a really good job there right now in terms of responding to the ball that was what we did with that bring it b game all right and so that's one of the things that you can work with them on all the time so you saw some kids in the game respond to the ball very well right and so if your child is not responding to the ball very well one of the things that you can do just have them work on that go find that ball go find that ball find that ball cuz they since they're very concrete if you go like this then throw the ball over here it's going to take them a while okay all right you guys have a good time all right can you be high five all right all right all right let's give these kids a big round of applause y good job thank you so much for coming out thank you
