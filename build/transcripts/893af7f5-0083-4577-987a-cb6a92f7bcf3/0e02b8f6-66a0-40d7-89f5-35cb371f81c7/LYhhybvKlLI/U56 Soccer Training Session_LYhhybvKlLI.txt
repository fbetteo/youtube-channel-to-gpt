hi I'm John Brennan I'm Director of Coaching for the Cherokee impac recreational program and in this session today we're going to be working on you six skills so belly ball tag is great for agility and coordination because the players have to run around quick as they can try to avoid the tag while holding on to the ball I will do that as an introduction as a warm-up just to get them going a little bit faster and they wouldn't do normally dribbling and then in the second activity we have them put the ball on the ground and just try to live away the tag in our skills section we worked on freezing the ball which is stopping the ball with a sole of the foot and then I went back into a tag game with the same idea and then in our next activity after that we show them pull back which is a very common thing that we do for training and then what the players are going to do is they're going to show the pull back to the coach in the end the group session okay so first game we're gonna play is called belly ball alright so what you're gonna do is gonna take your ball and you'll hold on your belly like this right here right so can you do pick up your ball hold on your belly got that okay so you guys gonna stay inbounds right gonna stay inbounds and then we're gonna try and tag you and you do not want to let us tag you or your belly ball Oh got your guests they go keep that ball on

good job oh that's not a pullback nice oh hey you guys I hope I got your ball five four three nice two one and rest let's go get a quick drink of water guys give your ball a drink if it needs it take one yourself red light green light goal is one of my favorite activities to do with the kids because they understand that from prior experience and then they just add the goal to it and what they're going to be doing is showing both close control of the ball the ability to stop the ball and then to shoot when they see the opening it was very large today so my suggestion is if you have that many kids at a session that you would have a bigger goal to work at there's two reminders number one is to make sure that the kids never go get their ball out of the goal after they score and number two is to make sure that the parents distribute the ball so you can get more rapidly to get another round in I line up like these guys are right here they're quickly quickly you guys gonna go right over there just line yourselves right up over there so we can face this goal down here you're gonna make sure they don't get their ball out of the goal okay yeah two ways we stopped our ball today right so say red light boom freeze my ball like that right there or I could freeze my ball like that right there all right when I say green light what do you do okay do you whack your ball long way ahead you keep it close to you right just like you're dribbling and when you hear red light you stop when you think you can score on the goal down there wave your hands coaches there you go when you think of scoring the goal down there you take your shot do you get your ball out of the goal no back there back there back there back there but critics rooo green light red light stop your boat I'll suck your balls suck your balls suck your ball freeze your ball freeze your ball freezable all right green light red light freeze your ball freeze your ball freeze of all freeze of all green light come see me come see me give me five give me five good five give me five get out of the goal give me five come on over our juggling skills sequence today started with our typical thing which is the jungle March where that's thigh with the right foot thigh with the left foot we're moving forward we're trying to get them to have one foot off the ground at a time so they can show balance and to put their other foot down and then raise so that they can show coordination which is a real struggle for this age group after that we went to double juggle which is faster and then we went to bounce juggle which we found is much more effective having the players have the ball balancing to try and play it and one of the biggest issues that we have with the players is that when the ball raises up their eye raises up and their foot raises up instead of waiting for the ball to go down so that's what we're looking for in the on the bounce juggle then we added in an advanced skill which is includes the thigh and the balanced combination it's the first time they've seen it today so very few were successful but we'll repeat this in future sessions all right guys let's hold that ball on your hands like this right here okay go there you go there you go all right take that ball and you get a pop it pop it boom time for juggle Marge nice job everybody you guys are so good at this now not that hard for you is it all right okay so such a great job it can move right to double juggle double juggle member - juggles and catch up ball just like that right there - and catch - and catch here we go hey go one to catch one to catch nice job there you go good job yes one don't catch it in between though can you do that for me one there you go almost almost remember don't catch it in between okay we showed you this once before let's see how you do on it okay you're gonna hold it out like this you're gonna let drop bounce juggle catch drop bounce juggle catch alright first with you right then with your left here we go drop bounce kick catch drop bounce kick catch I smell a front coming through yeah poor leader there you go up there you go drop pounds kick yes there you go drop bounce kick there you go almost so we're going to put those two things together and make sure you can see me put those two things together so we're going to go thigh bounce kick thigh bounce kick left thigh bounce right foot right thigh bounce left foot here you go fie bounce kick Hey right and then let's bounce on the ground and then kick it high balance kick well done you are so good at this stuff three five very nice job can you do it let's see bye show me thigh and they let it bounce on the ground so pop it up off your thigh balance and then kick it it's like this right here about 10 more seconds guys you're tired okay we're almost done with it and take a water break in a second you can do it there you go can you do it by bounce oh so close no you drop it on your thigh ooh then drops on the ground then you kick it there you go all right let's take a quick drink of water guys take a quick drink of water you guys ready what's going which goal you're scoring on that one right down there who's gonna
