question so here we go come on over here so what we're going to do is we're g to have everyone is going to be it but the objective is not to get tags for instance let's say Ethan here is trying to tag me come on try to tag me okay okay okay you guys think you can do that now everyone is it tag but don't get tagged what if you get tagged it's okay just don't I want to see how many times you do not get tagged ready go I like the twisting I like the Turning I like that your head is up you're looking around me good who can tell me something that you can do to get away from somebody what can you do yes you can get up you can twist and turn and try to get away from somebody can't you let's see if you can keep doing that just by chance before we go who has been tagged zero times see their hand I want them tagged at least one more time ready go good and stop let's go ahead and everybody go get a ball all right so let's come out here we're going to play the exact same game EX St what are we going to add the ball we're going to add a ball that's very good same game don't get tagged ready go I want to see if everyone can tag at least three people I've already got three see if we can get three more good control got you and freeze let's say you're about to run into somebody what could you do to fix that what could you do who thinks they have an answer if I'm about ready to run into them with my ball what can I do to stop it do a pullback do a pullback so if you were running at me and all of a sudden you were trying to get away from what would you do you would pull the ball back and dribble into space I like that can you guys do that all right do a pullback and everybody play the game one more time time ready [Music] go all right so here's what we're going to play we're going to play a game called aliens and Space Rangers all right now listen here's how we're going to play it all right I'm going to take someone's ball to start off with let's say she's going to be the alien okay what she's going to try to do is all of you guys are Space Rangers the alen's going to try to come in and you're going to take that ball take that ball from her if she takes that ball away what do you think she becomes she becomes the alien so what do you think you need to do now um take a take the ball away from someone else now if let's say since you're now the alien come over here and I have your ball let's say I'm you're chasing me you're coming after me and I dribble out of bounds what do you think's going to happen now you're an alien I'm an alien she gets the ball she would get the ball I like it she gets the ball cuz I went out of bounds cuz I don't want she to go out of bounds so now I'm the alien all right all right let's get everyone ready you're going to be my alien first so come over here okay now you're going to stand right here wait for me I want everyone to start moving around you have any strategy uh no you just going to go after him uhhuh okay let's see it ready go good we got one uh oh Jers good I like that everyone's moving I like that everyone has their head up looking around and stop see your ball two aliens go and everybody stop now if you're trying to get away from one of the aliens one of the people that don't have a ball what do you need to do or what can you do find Space find Space what do you mean what is space um like there that opened area that is space I like it so if someone is chasing you maybe you could find the open space to get away from correct I like it all right since I like your answer so much I'm going to have you be an alien ready three aliens go all right we have another alien and plate half aliens and half Space Rangers let's see who still has the ball when I say freeze I want to see who has the ball Landon I like the I like the competitive there yes it's his ball and freeze I like this picture come here go back to where you were he had the ball he's right here trying to control the ball what are you trying to do how are you keeping the ball away from two three people what are you having to do turn it turn it how you turning it can you show me with her get go ahead and get out and pressure on him show me how you're doing it what's what he's doing he's shielding the ball with his body so his body is in between there I like it so here's what we're going to do we're going to play a game called caught red-handed and here's how this game is played you two are Partners right you two are Partners what's going to happen is go ahead and scoot over there for a second now what happens is I'm going to be a tagger I'm going to be like the person on the green if I tag you I get a point okay pass the ball to him okay if he did that that means I now can't tag you I don't get a point so now I'm coming over here what do you think oh you got the idea all right so if you get tagged with the ball then that person gets a point now can you guys move around yes yes you can you two over here you guys ready everybody start dribbling inside the square the rectangle there you go start playing perfect play like the opening up I like it now how could you now freeze go ahead keep playing keep playing how could you have kicked that ball the inside of my foot the inside of your foot come here for a second so if you were going to pass this ball show me how you would pass it just don't just don't kick the ball yeah with the inside of your foot right yeah don't kick it with just your toe all right brilliant get back in there play 5 Seconds Four 3 2 two one that's definitely a point for them and time how many did you get um 10 10 good job five five 10 15 plus I only saw one so you got 16 points well done give me have your shirt all right let's go ahead and we're going to play a different game all right guys go ahead and partner up with someone the same height same height little okay okay same height come on there you go there perfect now will one of you go get a soccer ball just one of you decide who's going I will so here's what's going to happen we're GNA play a little maze game all right now there's a lot of different ways you can play this so I'm going to show you how you can do each one okay here's how you're going to start off with if you have the ball you're going to go first if you don't have the ball you're going to stay on the sideline every time she dribbles through one of these Gates and there's a lot of gates throughout here if you dri dribble through a gate you get a point if you try to dribble through and it hits the cone do you get a point no no so you go all the way through without hitting your partner is going to count for you so you just go as fast as you can ready play you have 20 seconds uh oh it's okay good recovery five seconds four three two one and time dribble back to your partner partner tell them to score make sure you have your ball next Group Play you have 20 seconds got to go between the yellow cones as fast as you can now here's what we're going to do this time I need you two gentlemen to come on out here in order to get a point listen up all you have to do is pass to your partner but the ball has to go through what the con the cone so can you guys demonstrate for me okay so he's dribbling there you go now go somewhere else can you pass it through the cones perfect can you guys do that everyone ready play oh I like it threading the needle between the small cones we have both a small gate and we have bigger Gates now I like that you guys were thinking outside the box what did you guys start doing and how did you get quick points passed back and forth through the same goal didn't you through the same gate that's great I didn't say you couldn't do that could I all right now this time you have to go to a different gate every time all I want you to do you see it is you're just going to come up to the ball put your foot on top you're going to pull it back tap and dribble all right everyone try it real quick pull the ball back after you've done it twice give it to your partner okay now pull the ball back a little bit harder pull the ball back a little bit harder okay pull the ball P back harder pull it back you're going to get one in a minute pull it back harder can you yes that's the way I want it to be done ready go remember you have to go to a different gate dribble do a pull back through it pass to someone else or pass to your partner 5 Seconds Four 3 two one and time now here's what I like to do how many points did you guys get six six show me with your fingers how many you got 10 all right you have to score one extra goal so if you got 10 how many do you have to get 11 11 if you got six how many do you have to get seven same time frame ready go got to go quick got to go as fast as you can can but keep control don't let it go out of bounds good now go somewhere else remember what we talked about how you get out of pressure how you can get somewhere quick keep the ball close and try to go fast all right and time all right good job can you guys grab how many did you get how many did you get 11 you got your 11 awesome you got your seven from your six how many did you guys get we're going to play a little 2v2 so here's how we're going to play it's always going to start with a server serving the ball to The Far Side once that happens the game is live okay very simple you two are trying to score and pass between those that goal you two are trying to steal it from him and try to score and then go that way now whoever kicks it out that person or that team has to kick the ball back to the other group so gray if you kick it out you are going to go back and place the ball to them because now it's their ball okay but we'll start with green serving it to gray ready play good great green come all the way back great since they score I like to reward that so we'll play the ball to them so now you get to play it to them and now you're playing on defense and freeze look at this huge gap hold on hold on hold on I like the idea what do you need to do after you play that ball what do you think you need to do one of you needs to go up right who do you think should go up why do you think you I would rather whoever's closest to the ball go to it now you can you over there so who's closer to that ball you right so I want to see you put immediate pressure run run run run run run run now stop right about there don't get too close do you need to come in to play yes help out but should you go that far no don't get that close so when you play that ball I want to see you get here quickly cuz now look how much room they have to play all right if you were way back there they had a lot of room that they can come get you okay scoot all the way back I want you to play the ball back to him and then I want to see it again all right ready go ahead okay it's closer to her so you go freeze now remember what we said whoever's closest to the ball should go after it right so go back to where you were if the ball went to her who's closer you are now closer so now you put immediate pressure and then you come come in right about there and now you play Okay so let's scoot the ball back all the way back and let's try it again so play the ball back to you they're going to kick it to you again all right go ahead good and play good play now can you come back balls out so green come all the way back gray give it to them they're going to serve it to you okay gray green hold it hold it green go back you kicked it out so serve it to gray all right go ahead and go so gray you're a team green you're a team we're going to be playing just a quick keepa away game all right so gray if you get it pass it to gray green if you get it keep it away from the gray okay ready play balls out Ball's out find open space we're kind of getting bunched up ready [Music] play make sure you make that pass a little harder Seth Ball's out and freeze go back stop where you are don't move giveing the ball back to him give the ball back to him take two steps that way everybody take two steps two steps that way you were right here okay you were right here asking for the ball all right now he did a good thing he played you into open space but can he get you the ball from right here no no so where would you go if you wanted to get the ball show me now I like it but he still one two steps away so what else could you do to get in even bigger space what else could you go look where you are you did the right thing go back to where you are stand still so she can see it about all the way back because if you stand here within two steps he's here right if you're way back over here he has to take four or five steps so he gives you more time to think about what you're going to do all right so let's go over here now when I say I'm going to roll the ball to him when I hit the ball to him I want to see you go in that open space you stay here because that's what you did ready play open it up now keep playing good [Music]
