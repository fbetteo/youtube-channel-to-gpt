with the pace of the game constantly evolving it's never been more important to work on your speed and not only is it important to be quick running forwards but it's also important to be fast moving in all directions with and without the ball and the four drills i'm going to show you today work on exactly that [Music] so for all four of today's drills we're gonna be using the exact same cone setup i've placed four cones around the outside to form a square each of the cones is five steps apart and i've placed one exactly in the middle so we're going to be doing repetitions with and without the ball so for the first exercise this is what it looks like we start at any of the cones around the corners we're going to run forwards push laterally so we're going from side to side then we're going to go backwards making sure we're pumping those arms back to the start get low push off then we're going to go all the way around in the opposite direction then we're going to get on the ball we're going to work on some ball mastery so once again starting at any of the cones we're going to use our sole the entire time our body is always facing forwards then we're going to use our soul our left sole across the front sew backwards right foot across back to the start then we're going to do the exact same thing in the opposite direction so go three or four times in both directions without the ball three or four times with the ball [Music] for the second drill we're going to work around the outside of the square once again but this time we're going to work on our turns both 90 degrees and 180 degrees so we start at any corner we're going to drive forwards this time once we get to the cone we're going to turn our body 90 degrees exploding around each corner and once we get back to the start plant our foot drive in the opposite direction then we're going to work on our opposite turns so that we're getting a balance on both sides then once we repeat three or four reps of that we're going to get on the ball we're going to dribble up then it's a 90 degree turn all the way around to the start then we're going to swap feet and go the opposite way with our left foot keeping close control sharp cuts till we get back to the start so three or four reps without the ball and three or four reps with the ball [Music] moving into the third drill now we're going to work on sharper turns so more like 45 degrees instead of that 90 degrees so a little bit sharper here we're going to start any of the four corners drive into the middle this time exploding out up to this top cone then we're going to go straight across around that cone back to the middle out pushing that ground away and back to the start then rest for 10 to 15 seconds then we're going to go the opposite way so on the first way up we turn to the left now with the middle cone we're going to turn to the right so drive up sharp turn right straight up around that cone into the middle straight up and back to the start i'd recommend two in each direction and then we're going to get on the ball and do the exact same thing so we drive into the middle close around that cone around straight across into the middle once again try and use both feet if you can all the way back to the start then we're going to do the same thing once again changing the direction so we went left the first time now we're going to turn right at that first coat up to the top into the middle out to the top and back to the start trying to make good use of both feet so i recommend four for on the ball and off the ball two in each direction [Music] and for the fourth and final drill we're going to start at any of the cones once again this time we're driving into the middle forwards and then we're going to back pedal 45 degrees in the opposite direction around that bottom cone forwards back pedal 45 degrees forwards 45 and then back to the start rest for 10 to 15 seconds come out to the opposite side we're going to do the exact same thing in the opposite direction so forwards backwards around that cone forwards backwards lots of little steps pushing that ground away all the way back to the start then we're going to get on the ball after we've done four repetitions of that two in each direction so we drive to the middle place our foot on top of the ball around the front back pedal up forwards back pedal on the ball once again get around that top cone all the way back to the start rest for 10 to 15 seconds come to the other side dribble out for the top of the ball back pedal forwards back pedal on the ball turn around that cone back to the start and that's where we finish so we're gonna do four repetitions with the ball four repetitions without making sure we're changing direction every two reps [Music]
