can you do free and catch yes and catch so it's getting used to using a different part your body using the fight to get the ball up good so four players boys and girls Ali's age five years old good to just use different parts as a body get used to it how can you catch it yeah it's going to be two now one to catch oh you got be able to catch it just go beyond your control one so go stay up in the air if you fight yes so the balls go go straight up straight up go one will go three two one ah okay never mind on to the combination so what would we just learn we did boxing Olli we did boxing we did this stop turn and then we did the scissors can you remember them okay give me go nice good try with a stop turn remember when you do it you leave that ball behind clanky a few more boxing in there good scissors you did my boxing yeah brilliant gonna finish off on a stop turn go towards the can I set one more stop down going towards camera remember you leaving the ball behind facing that wall turn it around gone yes I know superb great work me well done [Music]
