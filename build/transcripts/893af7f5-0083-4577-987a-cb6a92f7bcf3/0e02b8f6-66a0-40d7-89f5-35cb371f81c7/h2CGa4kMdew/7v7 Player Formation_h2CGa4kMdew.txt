All right, good morning coaches. I just wanted to take a minute. We've talked about the 4v4 shape a lot. I want to talk a little bit about the 7v7 shape a little bit today. As you can see the blue team is lined up in a 2-3 1 formation. We always start with the Defenders when we're naming the formation. So we have two at the back here. We have three in Midfield and one target player playing up front as the forward. The red team is in a different formation there in more of a 3 1 & 2. So these are the two options that we're going to start with here this fall that we want our coaches to be familiar with there's obvious advantages of playing three at the back where you have the ability to kind of keep your defenders in the zones that they're in with a center back a right back and a left back lots of work in this formation for the one center midfielder. So if you're going to play in a 3-1-2 you need to have someone that's really capable of playing in the middle of the park there and then two forwards up top providing with obviously in the attack. But also we want to make sure that they're able to move as well. Okay, so that's a little bit on the red side for the blue team with two at the back three across Midfield one up front in order to play two at the back. You got to make sure you have a couple of players here that can cover the ground. Obviously three players covering the width is a bit easier than two players defending the width. All right, A lot of times you can be effective by playing your goalkeeper high as well to provide cover for those two backs also. Okay, when you play in a 2-3-1, it's important that the right and the Left sided player are up and down getting up and down supporting the attack also supporting us at the back as well. The target player needs to kind of stay high as much as possible and stretch the game. Okay. If you have one target player versus two it's important that one always stays up so you have three lines the really big thing about our formations in 7v7 and we'll talk about this more and I'll be happy to meet with you more. To go over this is having three lines in both formations. We have a back line a Midfield line and a forward line same thing in here a back line a Midfield line and a forward line if we start to just get into clumps and take the lines away. It ruins our shape. Okay, so it's important that when we play let's say the ball is here forwards up obviously supporting the play. Okay back supporting the play and that provides us good shape when we start to do this and have Defender stay back. We have such a gap between our forward and our backs makes it really easy for the red team to have space in Midfield. I'd be happy to meet with all of you individually to go over the 7v7 shape because there's a lot that I'm obviously not touching on just wanted to give you a general idea this morning not make the video too long, but we'll continue to talk about different things such as our restraining line playing out of the back how to be effective in the middle third of the field and all the different areas of the field. So, weâ€™ll do more of these each week. Thanks for taking the time to listen.
