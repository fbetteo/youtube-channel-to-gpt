I'm going to walk you guys through a full change of Direction slash agility training session for pro football players let's get into it all right guys Chris Barney here from overtime athletes and I have a great video for you guys today I had the pleasure of working with my good friend coach Osama mustaba just post switch switch he is the strength and conditioning coach for the Toronto Argos he's also the owner and founder of 5-4 performance up there in Toronto he brought a group of professional athletes football players down from Canada what we're going to do is going to peel back the curtains and show you behind the scenes and show you exactly what a training session looks like where we elevated them from changing direction Plyometrics multi-directional all the way up to integrating that into some basic cutting drills for these guys before they got into their strength list check it out [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] here we go hey real quick we're gonna go through a series of lateral progressions okay we're gonna go skater jump here's what I want though I want a vertical focus of vertical Focus it's in tight so I want you Landing over your center of mass so I'm going to hit here toe right in front of the cone big jump stick stabilize and get into your next jump stabilize we're gonna go four total back and forth so it's two jumps back and forth stick stabilize stick stabilize yep good imagine a hurdle between hold your time stabilize for me show me a One Mississippi stabilization here we go stick control get out to the next one next guy up next guy up quick transitions here we go control yep kick it out one yard here's what I want now you just landed over Center of mass now we're going outside Center of mass so here's what I want you're going to go from cone push out to the other cone now I'm going flat I'm not going up in an arc I'm pushing flat stick that leg out stabilize stabilize for me push back to the floor here's the deal especially if you guys get real aggressive here my trajectory is going straight out it's not going up and then down right so my upper body is going to want to go this way I want you guys to flex your trunk like you just went to the beach what you consciously do in training you're going to subconsciously do on the field so make sure you focus on pushing out stay one unit stay tight stabilize get to the other side I got four reps here we go push stabilize fast and powerful and stabilized kick that leg out catch yourself let those ankles and knees work all right here we go first group push the comb back into where it was at now let's go reactive okay so I want to go back to that first jump we did right Arc get to that cone and then get back flat so I want a big jump here boom punch and then get back two on the right two on the left don't get stuck in the mud get back here we go it's fast I'd rather shorter jump and get back boom get back do not get stuck to each side to each side all right next one kick that cone out now we're going flat flat right we're going back to that second one so now I'm pushing out kick that leg out and get back as fast as you can two on each side here we go you're sticking that leg out outside Center of mass not a big jump come straight for me come straight for me here we go pop get back there we go there we go there we go push get back push get back all right here we go hey last one here now I want to go continuous four jumps but here's the deal I want the opposite hand touching that cone right so I'm coming here I'm gonna punch touch touch touch touch stabilize so it's continuous four you guys got two rounds of this let's go touch touch that comb for me Bend Bend don't get stuck don't get stuck four total the next man up and you got two full rounds in this two full rounds and there's four total the next man up that looks good that's it that's it hey here we go now let's add a vertical component you're going to push across then push vertical land push across pushing across push vertical push across boom four jumps you guys got two rounds let's go yep Slide fast and get up Slide fast and then get up good there you go as soon as you just touch that ground get out good yes sir yes sir we're done all right gentlemen I just gave you a third cone you're going to your left all right so now we're gonna actually change some directions okay so now we're going linear to lateral it's a single leg broad to 90. here's what I want you're gonna attack that cone I want your hips right shoulders over my toe I want you to bend at the hip I'm gonna attack this cone all my momentum's going this way I'm gonna put my toe right on the outside of that cone I'm gonna divert forces and drive out laterally here's what it is here stay tight boom stick Land Two nice and easy show me you can make that 90 degree cut and then land two and then Land Two yep good next man up let's go good hey second jump is Big second jump is Big you can land two I love it more advanced progression now you're reacting on the field you don't know what leg you have to cut off it's pretty when you cut off that outside sometimes you got to cut off inside so I want you to stay one unit I want it nice and easy nice and easy on this one we're gonna go inside leg so I'm gonna touch boom and I'm gonna push out and land okay nice and easy I don't need any Heroes right here get that contact get your body moving this way and push out right to right right foot up right foot out there we go that's a good one bang yep they had two feet everything's laying in two feet let's go push push yep laying two the most aggressive one as soon as you did two inside flip size now we're going outside leg two jumps you know your work get it done stay one unit keep your body one unit don't let your hips fall this way all right gentlemen we just changed the angle from 90 to 45 so you're warmed up there now let's give it a ride so if I'm going right I'm going outside big jump I still want to stay Square I'm not turning my hips after I get here so I'm here boom push out my toes are forward my hips and shoulders are square that tells me that when you put that foot in the dirt right here my toes are forward and I'm able to get over here big jump okay we're only going outside leg here big jump and land two yes sir and then two on the other side big second jump big second jump and then other side now all outside yeah so now shoot for this cone two each side then a shot of water let's go so we increase the threshold of that movement that cut now let's integrated with a Sprint that you're going to perform on the field it's a simple wide cut here's the deal you're not playing ball all right so I don't want you to try to time naturally you're gonna time your Cuts but really what I'm looking for is for you to attack this comb get out 45 degree angle which we just worked on and then get up field what I'm interested in is that foot getting in the dirt small inversion version pushing up and then same thing up does that make sense to you guys it's a simple change of Direction okay bang bang get up here let's go bang bang good bang bang good keep your toes forward bang bang get up here yes sir I see you QB yes sir let's go yes sir get to this cold hug this cone here we go bang boom boom get to the cone I'll get tight I'll get tight bang bang good [Music] oh get up yes sir yes sir uh uh good now we're making it more aggressive going to that 90 degree cut we were working right naturally you're going to want to jump cut all I'm looking for right is attacking this cone pushing laterally getting up field right if you got to take multiple then put that foot in the dirt and get up field it's just a more aggressive cut that's all it is I'm just diverting from linear to lateral to linear don't let me know that you're going this way you guys know where the cones are at oh yeah lateral stay one unit get up push show me toes forward get up good get over later get overlap push push get up gentlemen check me out on this cone right it's gonna be natural tendency to open that hip I want you to try to keep those toes forward keep those toes forward so especially when you're coming over here it's going to be easy to turn the toe out externally rotate and push off what you try to do it while keeping the toes forward here we go good I see you working boom boom I see you working I see you working good [Music] yes sir [Music] good so now we worked hard angular Cuts but on the field rarely rarely right are you that angular you're actually more running in a curvy linear Sprint most of the time all right so we're going to go quarter Arc all I want you to focus on on these is putting the crown of your head into the turn where the head goes the body will follow okay both legs have different priorities okay inside leg acts as a stabilizer outside leg is producing that power Drive good stay low drive that's a good one that's a good one yes sir dip the head the body will follow I love it I love it I see your big dog oh yes sir yes sir yes sir make those ankles work yes sir yep yep let's go I see your big dog all I did was scoot it in stay low to celery [Music] I see you big dog come on let's go yes sir yes sir if that happened to it yes sir first was not as aggressive let's go first one's not as aggressive yeah yes sir yeah put the Hat into it put the head into it yup I love it I love it good kind of crank it up now let's Crank It Up last one it's tighter it's tighter hug it huh [Music] yeah big boy I see you [Music] good rap stay balanced I see you big dog foreign yes sir guys shot of water shot of water good there you have it hope you guys enjoyed the video you guys were able to see how we progressed them all the way up to some basic cutting drills really trying to amplify those most isolated motions when the athlete is cutting uh through those different ranges of motion both under Center Mass outside Center Mass and then multi-directional hey want to give another huge shout out to coach Osama make sure that you guys lock in and follow them down below he's one of the best young coaches I've
