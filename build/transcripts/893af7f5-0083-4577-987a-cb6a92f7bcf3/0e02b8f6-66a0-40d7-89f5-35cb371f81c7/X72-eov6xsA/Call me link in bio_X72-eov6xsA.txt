Hey coach, what should be in my highlight video as a center mid? I'm really good at a lot of things, but I just don't know what to put in my video. Okay, let me break it down for you. The very first clip in your highlight video should be you scoring a banger from outside the box if you're a center mid. And if you don't have that, give us a different goal that you scored. But if you want to impress coaches, a goal from outside the box is key. Second is we want to see passes from the center circle being pinged out to the right back, left back on a going run and or into the striker in behind that leads to an assist or a second assist. Meaning your pass then leads to a pass which then leads to a goal. Number three is we want to see you dictate. So we want to see a sequence in which you get the ball, you get it back, you play it over there, fast forward the clip a little bit, then you get it back again, and then it ends in something, a shot or something like it. And then finally, you can then give us your defending. But at a highlight video, we don't really want to see your defending tackles until halfway through the video. We have to see your ability on the ball. Now, I'm going to add your center mid. You're not going to dribble past a lot of players. I didn't even mention dribbling. I didn't even mention passing it to players feet. That's not that impressive as a center mid. What is impressive though is your full game. Okay, but like how do I send my full game? Are they going to watch my full game? It's a long game. Very good. They're not going to watch your full game. So, what you're going to have to do as a center mid specifically is make more every touch videos than a striker or a winger because guess what? you're not going to have as many highlights. I'm a defensive center mid when I was playing, so I made a bunch of every touch videos. I feel like I'm the pioneer of them because I talk about them all the time. And the co coaches love them because it fast forward what otherwise would take them forever. And you have to think of something called activation energy. If a coach sees a trace video that's 90 minutes and you're not circled, are they more likely to watch that even if they really like you, or are they more likely to watch a fast forwarded version of it with every touch clipped? The second one, obviously. So, we're just making their life easier. when they want to watch a full game video, they will tell you and then you will send. If you'd like more help playing Caller, give me a call. Call links up. I will talk soon. Goodbye.
