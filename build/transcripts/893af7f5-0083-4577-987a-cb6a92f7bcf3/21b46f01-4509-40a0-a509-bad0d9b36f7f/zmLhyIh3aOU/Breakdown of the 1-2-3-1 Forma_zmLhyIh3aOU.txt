hey guys coach mike here and in this video we're going to be breaking down the 7v7 formation one two three one before we get going we need to first understand what is a formation a formation can be best described as a system of play it describes how the players in a team generally position themselves on the field during a match a player's position in a formation generally defines whether a player has a mostly defensive or attacking role and whether they tend to play towards one side of the pitch or centrally formations are typically described by three or four numbers which denote how many players are in each row of the formation from the most defensive to the most forward for example the five popular formation has one goalkeeper four defenders five midfielders and a single forward encouraging players to try and play different roles within the formation at 77 is crucial to developing young players at the 7v7 level it is important to expose players to every position for a good period of time so now we know what a formation is we now need to understand the field that we're playing on the 7v7 field looks like a regular sized field but just smaller the dimensions are roughly 60 yards long and 40 yards wide with the goals also much smaller in size compared to an allen b11 field there is also an extra line on the 7v7 field we refer to as the build outline or bol this is a line that stretches across the entire width of the field between the edge of the penalty area and the halfway line the purpose of the build outline is to promote playing out of the back in a less pressured setting when the goalkeeper has the ball either during play or from a goal kick the opposing team must move behind the build-out line until the play is restarted once the ball is put back into play by the goalkeeper the opposing team can cross the build outline and play returns as normal the other main areas of the field are the penalty area this is where the goalkeeper can use their hands thousand here also result in a penalty kick the goal area this is where the goalkeeper restarts play with a goal kick the line down the middle of the field is called the halfway line and this is the line players must retreat behind when players restart after a goal so now we understand what a formation is and the feel we're playing on let's take a look now at what the formation looks like the one two three one consists of one goalkeeper two center backs one sentiment filter one right midfielder one left midfielder and one center forward to help identify what players are playing in which role we assign players numbers our number one is our goalkeeper number four and five are our two center backs number eight is our sentiment builder the number seven is the right midfielder or if preferred a right wing back our number 11 is the left midfielder or again our left wing back and the number nine is our center forward also referred to as our striker generally speaking we want our players to remain in their assigned roles however as the game evolves so do the positional responsibilities for instance if our team has the ball we want to see our team take on more of an attacking shape this means that we want to see a larger shape with more space between the players and number seven and number 11 are wide and provide good angles to our central players and number nine stays high and above the ball to give us an outlet and an option to pass forward our two center backs split and provide passing options to our midfielders in the case they are not able to play forwards as our shape changes when we have the ball it also changes when we don't have the ball notice the shape becomes a little bit more compact and the players are closer together in order to achieve this and number 7 and number 11 pinch in towards the middle of the field our number nine drops off and is a little deeper and not so high up the field our two center backs are not too far apart and in a position to cover one another as the opposition moves the ball across the field from side to side and back to front it's important that the players remain as one single unit we call this shifting fully understanding a system of play also means we need to pay attention to the advantages of that system as well as the disadvantages here are the benefits of playing a one two three one by playing in the outside wing positions players learn to provide width the center forward stretches the field to create an optimal team shape providing length and height the team shape provides natural support angles around the player in possession of the ball by playing one two three one we can commit at least three to four players to the attack while still maintaining a decent organization in case we do lose possession the use of two central defenders forces players to become more competent in 1v1 situations defenders can also practice the roles of the first and second offender introducing the pressure and cover system [Music] here are the disadvantages of a one two three one losing control of the midfield is a possibility if we don't condense the field quickly enough after losing possession our two wide players must make a great effort to stay involved on both sides of the ball this means they must be involved in attacking plays as well as not forgetting their defensive duties if the proper support is not provided our center forward kedernet playing alone against several opposing defenders this makes it very difficult to maintain a reliable outlook the center midfielder is responsible for connecting the backs with the rest of the team if this does not happen well because the number 8 drifts at position the team could become disconnect [Music] overall the 1231 is a solid formation for 7v7 the reason that is probably one of the most commonly used formations out there is because of its simplicity it introduces the main key roles within a formation such as defenders central midfielders wide players and a forward player thanks for watching if you have any comments feel free to leave them in the comment section below and please don't forget to subscribe [Music]
