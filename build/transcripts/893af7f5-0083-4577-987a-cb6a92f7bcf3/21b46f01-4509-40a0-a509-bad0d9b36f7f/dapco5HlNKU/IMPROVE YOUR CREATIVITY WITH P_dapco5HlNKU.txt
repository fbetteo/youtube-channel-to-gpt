this is three types of playmaking [Music] skills drill one is dribbling through the cones into a finish and yeah this is important cuz I use this a lot in training and it's about how you move your body um to get away from the defender so yeah a really good exercise dribble through each gate and sharply cut through it this is to simulate a game scenario of a Defender closing you [Music] down as you see here this could be a Defender you have to drop the shoulder to beat him and if you can try and use both feet and do it the same again and just keep practicing like that and then try and get the finish off at the end [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] drill two similar to the first one it's a given goal a bit of power work um get the ball back and like I said into a finish or find your man at the end so so yeah that's how it goes drill two is a give and go exercise first give the ball to the other player and then make make your way through the obstacles then receive the ball back and play it into the [Music] target to progress this add multiple targets at various distances and add more obstacles and Gates I think it's important this drill because most people in my situation where I play in a tight space in the pockets would give the ball and not think and not react and get the ball back so I think this is important to stay switched on and try and receive it in in the lines and get the ball back in a dangerous area so this definitely helps my game [Music] this yeah moving on to this one now um it's going to be a receive and finish I think a strong part of my game that I seem to work on a lot which has had me success in my career with goals so yeah this one's really important um you have to be clever always looking at your man find the right distance touch has to be perfect um and like I said into a finish or or pass to your teammate but it's really important um the first touch you have to get it right um set you up for the next thing the third drill is a turn and finish another player will feed you the ball parallel to the goal receive the ball on the half turn and set yourself up for a shot practice turning inside and out as you'll need to be prepared for different in-game [Music] scenarios but also try and fake as well so don't always show him that you're going to go like that just like I did in in in the clip that you see there you know just fake and then come out so they don't know what you're doing [Music] [Applause] [Music] just a master class finishing with ph fold in [Music] there there it is repetitions up there for one of the biggest things for me you know um you know when you fail and it doesn't come off to try again and keep going and that's what football's about some days you going have bad days but it's about keep trying and keep repeating the stuff and it'll come good in the end [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
