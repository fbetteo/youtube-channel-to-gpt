So, what I thought we'd do for the first part of the session is work on as a warm-up a bit of agility work. The O has got to catch the X. The X has got to try and get through those two yellow cones in 5 seconds. And the O's has got to try and try and catch him, tag him. It's an agility warm-up, but part of it is closing down. So, it's it's relevant to defending part of it for the guy trying to dodge you as an attacker, whether he's got the ball or not. So, he's trying to roll around you, not letting you touch him, not letting you tag him, maybe going back into space, and then exploding, but he's got five seconds to get through those cones. You've got five seconds to tag him. Okay? So, when I say go, you got 5 seconds, you got five seconds. You got to get through there. Dodge him, weave, trick him out of the way, trick, bang, bang. Lots of movement. Okay? Off you go. 5 seconds. One, two, three, four. Did he get through 1 nil? Change places. The first game was a 5-second catch game. Really, the guy's got 5 seconds to get through the the cones. The defenders got 5 seconds to try and tag him. So, all those movements, multi-change uh changes of direction relevant to defending were were were in those really for me agility sessions. Off you go. One, two, three, four, five. He's got through. Jeepers creepers. Off you go. One, two, three. He's got him. Good defending. He's nailed him. And then we took it into uh we paired them up uh in terms of we we had can you we played the type one. Can you lose your man? Can you get away from your man in this big area? What I'm going to allow you to do, the reds are going to be the attackers. The blacks always have to be touch tight. So if Billy's running round in here and I'm the black slowly I'm touch tight now you've got one chance to get out of here without me staying with you. So as you're jogging round one change of direction might be here and then quickly go that way. One change of direction I'm allowing. Can you get outside the area and lose him? So slow the defender down but I'm going to call out and inside 20 seconds you got to make your move. Now whether you make your move after 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds is down to you and down to whether there's space to run through. 20 seconds. Off you go. If you get out, keep your scores. Change places. Only one change of direction. Well, that's not bad. That's not bad. You nearly stayed with him. Good. Only one change of direction allowed. You got to stay in there. There's the grid. Now, just every now and again, as good defenders do, just let him know you're there. Just let him know you're there. Let him know you're there. And when he's ready, now I'm going to allow two changes of direction. So you can work in one way, then chop and go the other way. Be aware of the other players in here. I don't want any injuries. Okay. 20 seconds. Off you go. Be aware of the other players. And stop there. In you come, boys. In you come. What's your thoughts about that in terms of of how you lose your marker in a match? Do you think that's relative? What about for the striker? What's the striker got to be doing? Knowing knowing I'm walking off him. I'm moving him. What have I created? Now I'm getting back across him.
