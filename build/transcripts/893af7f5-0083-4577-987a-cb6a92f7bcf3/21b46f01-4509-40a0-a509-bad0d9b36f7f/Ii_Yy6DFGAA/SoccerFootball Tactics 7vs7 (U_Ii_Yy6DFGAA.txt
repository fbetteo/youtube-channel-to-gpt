hey [Applause] [Music] hi hello and welcome to ab soccer's first installment of a series of tactics soccer videos focused on youth soccer from u9 all the way up to you 18 and above we'll be focused specifically on the seven verse seven nine verse nine and eleven verse eleven formats and the purpose of these videos is to discuss some of the experiences i have had as a coach working with amateur youth teams in the us and the uk and to analyze the positives and negatives of different formations and systems hopefully this can be a help to some grassroots coaches who are maybe new to taking over a team and are in the early stages of the us soccer development so the focus of today's video is going to be the advantages of a 2-3-1 or a 2-1-2 system and how that lines up against a 3-3 system um so this is the 7-7 format we've got two teams here we've got a team in the yellow a team in the red we have the one three three as you can see here you got the three defenders on the yellow team and the flat three attackers on the yellow team as well the red team are set up with two at the back one that's in the hole in the middle and then you've got the three you can call it the three or the two one a bit further forward and attack um so we're just going to talk about some of the advantages of how this system the two three one system on the right can work against the system on the left um so i've i've been coaching seven aside um u9 u10s u11s girls and boys for the last two years um so i've actually had a chance to experiment with a couple of these different systems um initially we started out with this three-three system that's on the left um and i ended up progressing to the two the two three one or sorry two one two two one that you see on the right just because i found that i had a lot more advantages and even if you haven't got quality players you can still make things work in this system on the right hand side so advantage number one that the two one two one has over three three is that it has a better shape so the two at the back you need two strong players at back so the number two and the number three uh they need to be strong players as does the four i think that's the most important thing about this system is you have to have a strong player in the middle because they're going to be doing most of midfield work on their own and the two at the back if they're left to play up against three strikers you're going to hope that they're going to be able to contain that um mainly a lot of what i've seen is a lot of you sucker um it is played in the sort of middle of the park mainly you don't get you don't really get players um at the amateur level they're good enough to sort of dribble the ball down the wing and play a ball across the box you do get you do get some teams that maybe will coach specifically to try and target those areas um to try and target the wide areas but by what i've seen um work working working with the youth teams um at sort of you you 9 u10 levels is that this is unlikely and it is it doesn't happen as often as you think so i like to i like to pack out the middle in my two in my two one three my two one two one um so this is try and keep it as narrow as possible um and the reason that i like this player in the middle here is because when the yellow team i push forward so what you find a lot is in you teams is the the defensive three they're very rigid and i think a lot of coaches tell their defensive three you know to try and stay in a line um your defenders so you need to stay back and you get what you get is you leave a huge hole in the middle this is what i saw the first time i came to us um i saw a huge hole between the the offensive three and the defensive three um so that creates a problem because if i've got my two one two one system let's say my four um has dropped back in to help out the back three as i'd like him or her to do i like to have my six stay high and usually what what i've tried to coach from my players is i don't want my attacker standing on the defender so i want my attacker standing in that gap so when the ball for example if the yellows lose the ball there i'll probably want my seven helping out here because because the ball's on this side so when the ball is on that side of the field i want my right-sided player dropping in um my left-sided player i could probably have a bit higher uh you know even if even if their defenders do push up a little bit and they leave one in the back but that ball then if he's played into the middle whereas of one if he's played into this area here um if we can get a player that turns on the ball we can also create a chance going forward in these positions so now we might have players that are a bit wide defenders are a bit wide so we're trying to almost create like a three on one situation so you know it doesn't always happen this way but what i found is that that area in the middle um can be exploited in a 3-3 um because of the if the if the yellow attacking players don't understand that they need to be helping out defensively as well um sometimes this can be taken taken advantage of advantage two of the two three one system or the two one two one system is that i find it's easier to coach wide players or especially why players on this sort of defensive and offensive responsibilities so that means that when we're going forward so if we get into a position where we've got the ball in a forward position i'd have my two so my number two and my number three i'd have them as my last line of attack i'd always want to try and be in the opposition's half um i never want my two defenders sat back here because once again that opens up that gap that we spoke about in an advantage one so that opens up a gap for us there we do not want that big gap we want to stay nice and compact as a team even when we've got the ball in there after we all want it we want to try and pin them in so if we do lose the ball we can try and win it back as quickly as possible so the spaces between our players are always as short as possible um to try and counter attack at that ball so trying to counter press when we lose the ball so even in these positions here if we lose the ball to a yellow so i bought uh yellow text takes that that ball off the seven um and goes past him okay so immediately what we're looking at is we don't want our forward three just thinking all right that's it our job's over um we've lost the ball we'll just sort of way around on the halfway line we immediately want those players to start dropping back in and this is hard hard to coach at the amateur level um with this sort of you know u10 age groups it is that sort of transitional element that we're trying to teach them but it's so important if you can get your kids understanding that as soon as possible um it's you're going to do better for it so you know obviously there's in this situation uh four's caught the wrong side so there's a big gap in the middle um we'd be looking for this player to cover so if that ball does get played into this area we're looking for this three to cover here in this situation but also looking for that five to come back because that's seven is going to be running to try and join the attack on for the yellows so yeah so the advantage is you can quite easily coach the players about their defensive and ris and offensive responsibilities so we just go back to our original systems uh how we originally set up so the in the 3-3 as i touched on um with the first in the first advantage is a lot of time there's that kind of that idea that defensive players don't have to do offensive work and the offensive players don't have to do defensive work and it's sort of like right i'm defensive offense i think that's something that we as coaches need to get out of the habit of um i know not everyone does it but i have seen it on the sidelines where it's kind of like i've seen that the back three and the offensive three this far apart and that is so dangerous if you lose the ball um because there's a huge gap in the middle so you don't you you never really want a gap um because it is hard to teach uh kids at this age um about low blocks and about high blocks um high presses is one thing you can just tell them make sure that all the players are in the opposition half um to try and win the ball that's that's fairly easy to coach um but trying to trying to teach players to get behind the ball um just to start for the opposition is a very difficult technique to teach the kids at a young age especially in amateur soccer advantage three for the 231 system is that i feel it offers some tactical fluidity and flexibility um so if we go back to this situation here where there's a the attackers have got the ball here let's say for example you got a team that pushes their players forward we're in this situation here so you have a four that you can tactically get them understanding their positioning um if you can get them to drop in and to help out the back the back two you are creating that three that you had before the only difference is that we're a bit closer together and also if that four wins a ball so usually this this player needs to be strong um in my goals team this this is the best player that we have so it's always important if they can win the ball they can carry they can play a pass um and then immediately they're transferring into an attacking player and it's also important to make sure these players know uh to get up with that number four so i just think it offers a bit more tactical fluidity um where she got the back three it's kind of like all right so this player they could do that as well so this could be the number three in this in this situation um but sometimes i've found that you know this this player usually is the one that that stays back the one that drops back and these two kind of just all right so coaches told him to stay in line with the three so make sure you stay in line usually this is a solid player for the opposition um what i found is you sent it back usually you won't have a good spine through the field so with the two with it with the the two three one um i've always got my my two center backs are solid um the best player in the middle just ahead of them doing the sort of box the box midfield work your two wire players you can sort of you can afford them to be uh the less technically proficient um but as long as they understand the game and they understand where they should be and they shouldn't understand their sort of offensive and defensive principles um you can get away with it and also obviously you you what you want someone who can put the ball in the net up front so the last advantage of mp4 for the 231 system is passing lanes or options um so what this means is if we're starting with the six as the striker here so say we're playing the ball back to the four let's say for example these players push up okay so in it's in a two on three uh we have the option to play an angled pass i think angle passes are so important with this game because we're creating these shapes creating these triangles um with these players i think this system allows for that it's always a potential angled pass and you're always leaving players with or you should always believe in players with the option of two passes at least so even if that player does press the player on the ball and there's a player pushed there you've got the opportunity to play the pass in there to the two and then hopefully the six should be creating some space in the middle um on the flip side to that when the three's got the ball when the yellow three's got the ball and the six is pressing here what i find is that flat passes don't do anyone any favors so a flat pass goes in there and we've got a few we've got a lot less options as a yellow team i think um you two you two you two passes so your flat pass back to three's probably been cut off if you got a clever striker they they might try and block off that pass at this age group probably not as um it's probably not as common for for players to have that kind of intelligence um to block the pass off and they're almost certainly not going to go back to the keeper um i i'm at your level um of this age group so unless that six um is is shown in the middle um you've got an opportunity where you could probably press that number four if they're blocking that pass there and there's a good chance that you might take the ball off them so i just think it's quite flat so the 3 3 is quite flat so if we had to start as a starting position we had that two there so for the yellow team and the three here there's already that passing there potentially that that passes already been created um just based on the shape so we're already creating passing lanes for the triangles the triangle shape so we can always try and play that there's a one two there or there's a there's a there's a given go um so i just think that's a that's another advantage that we can use in the two three one and what i find also is if we just go back to the original positioning so let's say like that what i find is when obviously obviously this player is going to be playing with the back to goal quite a bit so when that ball gets passed into there um this player is going to receive with her with her back to go or he's back to goal we don't want as a team to have that in all three players um obviously that player might be there so let's say in our two three one our four's pressed up on the six so they got the back to goal so it's quite easy to mark um this player might go there but you're not going to get a player that's going to pass straight through unless they get wide which might be which might be an option in that case they can open up and then dribble but what i found is that a lot of players you know at this age especially um they don't open up like that as quickly as as they possibly could um so i just think having that system already implanted and you know you're not even if even if the player receives that wide you probably get you're probably going to feel pretty safe that you can you can trap back even if they're going to go dribble down that way you're going to feel pretty safe that seven can trap back and and sort of cut off any any sort of danger and if even if the six goes in there i'd still back my team in these positions um because as i said before in in the in early run in the video um it's very unlikely that you're going to get players that can sort of play you know across in as there's going to be a finish very very few goals i saw um in the last couple of seasons that i've been from crosses so usually a lot of it is breakaways in the middle of the park um so that's just another another advantage just to just to cap it off um just comparing the sort of the 231 system up against a 333 so hopefully if you've learned a few things um from this um drop drop some comments in um if you like the videos i'm going to be doing a a nine a side one and eleven aside one and possibly some more sort of related to different aspects different defensive principles different offensive principles so yeah cheers guys
