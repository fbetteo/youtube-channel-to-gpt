is that fair enough yeah yeah okay so tonight we're gonna give you towards the simple principles that we use in our playing style okay so basically we like to keep possession at a bar we need to build up our attacks and we don't need to be able to go and let us express ourselves in the final time everybody understands that don't they yeah tonight we're gonna we're gonna go through some of the exercises to reinforce them okay shooting for tonight is I'm looking for a movement off the ball to help the boy on the ball uh looking for good decision making and then I'm looking at the quality of the past here does that make sense okay so that comes off you have a Ronda was going to be specific towards the game so we have a 4v2 in this area here and then in this area here we also have a 4B team see that so if you just have a little small little look around you've got the red cones so this is one area foreign to try and build up some more playing there that make sense yeah I'm not gonna pass it around again these guys here can't pass it they can transfer the ball it's only to go in the middle so if you look at this in terms of the seven side pitch you've got goalkeeper two a few fullbacks two Defenders your central midfielder in your tree forward players that make sense that's what we're going to do tonight that's just to kick off in a run now then we're going to go into a passing exercise put some hoarders and some ladders to work on our on a quick feed and then we'll go into it again so fair enough um Okay so um foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] I think foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign excellent anybody else the quality of the past well done yeah communication yep come on you have something for me he's blocking the song come on what have you got what did you what what was I trying to put you on okay so you're starting position all right cool very good so we've got movement Waterville decision making did I talk to anybody Nathan about the future mate but what was I speaking to you about in this area here about the decision making of the way so what church is that one is when he's doing your train I want you to get to a certain handball that as much as if you're receiving the ball in the match you know when you received the ball on the train you have that same feeling as what you do in the match but we want to try and create that ceiling but when you receive it in the game you it's way more intense when you're in the match isn't it well because you feel like you're under a bit more pressure the match when you have time on the ball within that pressure that intensity will drop this is that fair enough okay so look at three three things is very good decision making quality of the past hands up who was happy with the quality of the house girlfriend you were happy yeah good boy Daniel you were happy yeah okay so that's what okay it's a basic thing but I want these for the rest of the exercise and focus on the quality of your past get the ball bubbles along the ground what does that mean boy so come grabs up all them really fast
