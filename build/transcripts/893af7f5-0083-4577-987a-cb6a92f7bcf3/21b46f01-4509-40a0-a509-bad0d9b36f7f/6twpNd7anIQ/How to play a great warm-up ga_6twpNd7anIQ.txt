our warm-up game is knockout in knockout we have a designated area that is defined with cones for 10 players an area about 15 yd square is pretty good while dribbling their ball players attempt to kick away the ball of the other players if your ball goes out of the area you are out last player in is the winner this is a fun competitive game where children try to see how long they can stay in the area before getting their Ball kicked out by an opponent
