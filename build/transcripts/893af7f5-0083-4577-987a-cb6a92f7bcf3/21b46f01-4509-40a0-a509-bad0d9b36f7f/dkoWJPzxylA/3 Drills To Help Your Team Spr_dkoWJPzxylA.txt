hi everyone one of the biggest challenges of the coach is to prevent your team from bunching up so right here are three drills to have your team spread out and create space for one another [Music] the first row we have is a simple 3v3 on a 10 by 15 yard pitch the difference in this 3v3 is that the teams are attacking two goals so the goal in each corner this drill is effective because the players will learn very quickly to spread out in this drill without you as a coach having to tell them to do so an example right here as the red team pressed on to number six on one side number eight and the blue team stayed out wide because they know they can switch the ball and have a shot on an open goal [Music] [Music] the second draw we have is set up on a 15 by 15 yard pitch and again it's 3v3 the numbers can be changed and put more on if need be but in this example instead of goals you have different gates throughout the grid and the way a team scores by playing the ball through the gate and their other player receiving on the other side now this encourages the players to spread out and create space because if they can't get through one to gate they know they can reach out to the other side and then still score [Music] this last drill here is a different approach and the size of the grid just depends on how many players you have but quite simply how many players you have in the grid are numbered one to the max number and the example one to five and number one will pass the number two two to three and so on but the difference is here once the player has passed the ball they will then have to run to a cone on the outside of the grid now this drill works to help spread out and create space because naturally the players tend to gravitate away from the center of the grid because they want to be closer to the cones to then go around and start to play again [Music] [Music] so there are three drills and different approaches to help your team spread out and create space have fun and good luck [Music] you
