All right, we're here today with the AYSO and Western Select. We have a bunch of young soccer players here that joined us for today. Thank you very much everyone and say hello. Hi. All right, we're going to start right away. Okay, we're going to do a little speed dribbling and change of direction and then we're going to have a little game that we're going to play with them before we go into our first activity. We have this big blue area right here, guys. Dribble Frey, go. Find open space. Keep your speed up, guys. Keep your speed up. 20 seconds. Find open space. Short touches in tight spaces, far touches in big spaces. Try to avoid crashes by using your eyes and looking up and finding open space consistently. Five, four, three. Quick, two, one. Time. All right. And hold. What surfaces can we use again on our foot to dribble? Soul. The sole. The bottom of our foot. the outside of our foot and the inside the inside of our foot. Now, let me ask you, when you use your inside, are your toes pointing down or up? Up. Up. When you use your outside, are your toes pointing down or up? Down. And when you use your saw, your toes are just regularly pointing forward. Yeah. Now, very important that you pay attention right now. Give me a ball for one second, Valentina. So, we're going to have three numbers. On number one, we're going to turn with our inside one whole round. On number two, you guys going to turn with your outside. And number three, we're going to hop backwards and turn with our soul. Now, it's very important to me when I call a number, for example, number one, and you do your turn one round, afterwards, I want you guys to change your speed really quick. Yes. So when I call a number and you are done with that little activity with your one turn, I want you to change your speed really quick. How do I change my speed? With a short touch or far touch? Touch. Very smart, guys. Trible. Two. Quick and change your speed. Very nice. Three. Good. And speed up. Good. Two. I'm coach. Quick. One. Inside turn. Yes. Good. And speed up into open space. Very nice, Gabby. And three. Good. and hold. Freeze. Now guys, why do I put my arms out like this when I say three? For balance and protection. So I can balance myself better when I'm more on one leg. And when I have a man on me, I can have my arm out here so he can't steal the ball from me. Try to steal it from me. Yeah. Yeah. See? And I can spin around him. Okay. So that's where my arms help me a lot. So, when you do this move, make sure you put your arms out and you turn. Yes. One last round. Ready? Go. Do it one more time. One. Quick turn. Quick turn. Quick turn. And speed up. Three. Arms out. Arms out. Arms out. Yes. And hold. Freeze. Good. Guys, we just talked about it. And some I still had to remind that they had to put their arms out. Use them. It's very important. Trust me. Now, do you see all these little gates that I built here? They're white and orange. We have some orange and some white gates. Now, you will dribble freely. And when coan says go, you're going to try to dribble through as many gates as you can. Two. And you count them. Three, four, five. Now, what do you have to watch out about? People. People. There's people living in this space with you. All right. So, make sure you look out for them and don't just run them over. If there's somebody in one gate, what can I do? And that's what the game is, too. If a space is closed, I go to a different space. Yes, guys. All right. Job freely. Whose ball did I have? Okay. I'm going to cheat. Right here. No treble. Go and count your gates. And who had more than 10? Maddox, how many did you get? 11. Is anybody with more than 11? How many, Thiago? 12. Anybody with more than 12? 15. 13. Uh, 15. 15. All right. 15 with the highest. All right, man. You guys are fast. Now, I watched a few people and some people are doing a great job. What do you think this is good for? Changing direction. Direction and changing speed. When do you think you should change speed? Yeah. And right now in this activity, when do you think you should change speed? When you when you say when there's open space. Yeah. And basically after every gate, after every change of direction, after every change of direction, I change my speed for a second. Yeah. I slow down a little bit, I speed up again. I slow down a little bit, I speed up again. And I move aggressively, aggressively. Yeah. Ready? One more time. And dribble, dribble, dribble. No gates yet. Dribble. Go quick one. Change your speed and direction. Crash on I95. Change your speed and direction. Sorry, Gabby. Quick, quick. 20 seconds. Short touches and tight spaces. Short touches in tight spaces.
