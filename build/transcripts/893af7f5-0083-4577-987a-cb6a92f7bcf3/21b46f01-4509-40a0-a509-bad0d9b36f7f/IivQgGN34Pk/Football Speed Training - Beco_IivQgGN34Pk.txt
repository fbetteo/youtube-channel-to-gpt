so my name is carson efforts i'm running the tennis beat academy here in gothenburg in sweden we established the business here two years ago but in general i'm for more than 20 years a speed coach in in that business the concept is coming from from switzerland so there's a guy who used to be the national coach of the high jumpers at the olympics that is huntstonner and he then started to work at the football academy of eftiti and that is where he developed the whole concept for football players because football players need to be fast not only track and field athletes well what we are doing is that we are trying to help young talents and young professionals to make the next step to reach the the next level in their game that they have an advantage to to the other players because if you're the first one at the ball obviously have a big advantage in playing football if you're running 1.7 seconds on 10 meters and i'm running 1.8 seconds on 10 meters so that means you're one tenth of a second faster you will be 58 centimeters ahead of me when you reach the finish line so that means one tenth of a second which takes a wink of an eye gives you one step ahead as an advantage speed in modern football is becoming actually more and more important when we compare the game 20 years ago to today you see a big difference but we can also see in 20 years it will be even faster and when you now see the the players the young players like mbappe or sunny in manchester city or north century and bros at dortmund there when they came up from the academy they're much faster than the players who were on the pitch and that is actually your first advantage when you're coming from an academy or from a youth development the first thing you can compete with the older players is the speed as an 18 year old you can run faster than the 35 year old you cannot read the game better you cannot pass the ball better but you can run faster and the acceleration more than 50 of all our sprinting activities is less than 10 meters so the acceleration that is what we really have to focus on today we're going to show you a drill for each level there are certain levels we we have to consider when we have speed training it starts from the basics it goes to acceleration deceleration change of direction then we will go to player metrics then we go to resistance training and then we will go to overspeed training and these are the levels you have to go through when you want to become faster so what we're going to show you today is one drill so that you can start doing this so the first drill i'm going to show you is a basic drill part of the warm-up we call it flying bed you will activate the hamstring muscles which is very important for running fast so how it's going to do you try to touch your right foot with your left hand and at the same time you stretch your right arm in the air and then you jump on the other foot just like this now you go and you jump from the left foot on the right foot exactly and always try to be only on the front part of the foot okay never on the heels very good okay like this [Music] that's it and try to stretch your hip yes okay now the correction i would make is that you have to move your arms not like like wing of an airplane but that you go straight forward okay that's it [Music] as you see this is a movement of the arms when you run so therefore you rather go this way than that way okay so you do this drill two times you see here we have about 20 meters so this is you do each drill two times but now when you start you can also do it four five six times so that your body is really getting used to the movement so so this this drill is very important for the hamstring muscle because what you actually do when you're running is that you move your leg like this you bend your knee you stretch your leg this is how you run when you bend your knee you activate the hamstring the muscle in the back of your leg when you stretch your leg you activate the quadriceps the muscles in front of your leg these muscles they must be as balanced as possible if this muscle is slow and these muscles are fast you can run only as fast as the slow muscle so therefore we have to activate the muscle the hamstring as good as possible that your muscles are as balanced as possible and then you can start running faster now i'm going to show you one drill with the agility ladder which is still basic drills but already a little bit more advanced so what are you going to do is that you have two contacts in each box like this then you go with the left foot in the right ring the right foot in the left and then two contacts and then full speed to the cones in the back so that you have a high frequency of the steps a change of direction high frequency and a sprint so this is how you can develop your speed okay are you ready to go it's all up to you very good okay so what you saw here with with jay what he's doing that he lifts his knee very high that's not necessarily what you want to do try to have the knees a little bit lower and try to be very upright when you do this okay you want to try one more time and you go that's better that's better here we go good excellent and there's two things which are very important always try after the ladder that you have to sprint as fast as you can because what you're going to do in the ladder is that you increase your frequency and you want this frequency when you're when you're sprinting so that's one thing the second thing is if you have the chance do this without shoes try to do it bare feet because we have a lot of receptors a lot of muscles in our feet and you can develop them much better when you're doing it without the shoes okay one more time here you go [Music] very good excellent so this drill you do six times eight times also very important is always you have to try to rest in between we have a saying that the intensity to rest should be one to twenty one to thirty that means if you do something for one second you should rest 20 to 30 seconds if you do something two seconds you should rest 42 seconds 60 seconds because your muscles they need a little bit rest to relax again and then you can activate them again if you do it too quickly you're just getting tired in your muscles and not really fast so always go back slowly when you do this and take your rest and then you do it again with maximum intensity okay one more time that's it perfect so this is an easy drill it's still in the basics but already with a change of direction with a change of movements and that is also what helps you to become faster so in level number two what you try to do is acceleration deceleration change of direction this is an easy warm-up game you can do at any place all you need is two cards with different numbers you see here yellow number three and number four and here you see orange number four and number three so with this you can try to connect the decision with an action and that is very important for the game because this is what you constantly do in the game that you always have to react on something take a decision and then make a move so this is what you can learn and do in your warm-up jay now you see yellow number three you sprint one line forward as fast as you can when you see number four you turn around and sprint as fast as you can one line backward and then you turn towards me again okay three goes forward four goes back are you ready excellent okay that was the first one you see with the yellow one you have always a quick acceleration then you have to stop when you see number four you have to turn around and you have to spin the other direction exactly what you do in the game so you do this always force rinse okay that's all you need then after doing this one or two times you can change the colors now you see orange now number four means you go forward and number three means you go backward so you do exactly the opposite thing just like this okay are you ready [Music] good okay and now you could see that you had a little bit of a rest in between right a little bit of a break and this is sometimes what happens when you need some time for the decision and we try to decrease to have this break as short as possible and then you can move faster on the pitch when you change from one movement into another one okay this is you can also do this one or two times if you want it a bit more complicated you use both cards that means now number three yellow goes forward number four orange goes forward number four yellow goes back number three orange goes back are you ready for the challenge [Music] [Applause] [Music] here we go very good very good but you see how difficult that is for you because now you have number three and number four but now you also have different colors so the options before it was two options and now we have four options just with the same move and that makes it more difficult for your brain but your body needs to react exactly the same thing so you can do this in even more combinations of course to make it more and more difficult and this is how your nervous system learns and this is how you can improve your speed on that now we're in level three this is when we come to pleometrics for your metrics is that you try to activate your muscles as good as possible because one thing the best players the sprinters have in common is that they are not a lot of time with the foot on the ground because when your foot is on the ground you're not moving so you want to spend as little time as possible on the ground so to reduce your contact times you have to activate the muscles in the best possible way and this is what you can do with the agility later now we're going to show you one drill which is helping you to decrease so to have the contact time as short as possible what you're going to do is that you have two contacts with the left foot in the right box and then one contact with the right foot in the left box [Music] so you have very short contacts that's one thing and again after this we're going into a sprint so it looks like [Music] the focus here you want to have is try to be as upright as possible when you change the direction when you see a player like messi he will dribble like this he will not go with the body like this but his body is always upright and that is what you learn here in that drill you ready for the challenge then there you go good yes now you see when jay is doing it that he's still moving with the body a lot okay so try to be very straight with your body that's better good good okay now you have your arms down here the arms are actually very important to support your core when you raise your arms immediately your core muscles will start activating when you're down here they're not activated so always try that you're a little bit higher that your arms support your core when you're doing this okay try to do it one more time that's it good much better okay and you see here the more often you do this the shorter your feet will be on the ground and also you're getting more and more used to this so therefore that's very important that we have to get used to things and then we're becoming faster in level number four what we're going to do is some kind of resistance training what you need for this is just a a band like this you might have seen this just lately messi was using this also you can see it on his instagram account so this is what the players are using to develop their force force means the power you can accelerate and this is what we're going to do now so just put it on like this and now i can hold j very good okay and what you're trying to do jay is just to do some skipping and move forward okay and you see how difficult that is and now i'm moving a little bit with him go go go go go go go okay so with this kind of drill you're learning to use your muscles in a proper way okay you see how difficult that is when you're moving in this if i release you from the band then it will be much easier for you because now your muscles are are used to it and then they can go quicker okay so you're improving your your strengths and then you can use this for the acceleration so you do it one more time and try to move forward go go go go go go and that's solid good [Music] wanna do it one more time okay okay then give it [Music] good that's enough excellent good a little bit of work for your muscles and you see this was only for five or ten seconds now and this is already enough so you have maximum intensity but only for a few seconds not too long okay one more time after a little rest wait a second ready to go and you go good one okay that's enough so this is a resistance training that's a very simple drill you can also do it in change of directions of course but that's what we're going to show you next time and then it would be level number five which is the overspeed level so the last level of speed training is what we call overspeed overspeed means that you're running faster than you actually can so how do you how can you do this what do you think you can do this for example by running downhill or if you're pulled if somebody's pulling you then you can run faster than you actually can run on the pitch so we don't have a downhill area here so therefore i'm going to show you another drill the thing is what you always have to do here is it's maximum speed maximum frequency this is how you go into overspeed this is the activation of the central nervous system very important if you want to run fast so what we're going to do here is that you just in maximum intensity and speed try to move forward on the line but only for five or ten seconds not any longer this is as much as you need to do so jay are you ready for the challenge you start from here on the line as fast as you can with your feet okay i want to see the quickest feat you ever had in your life are you ready for this that's it go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go good it's very intense for the muscles so again here you have to have a big rest a long rest in between otherwise i'm just destroying you i don't want to destroy you i want to make you faster so therefore you do this and then you have a long rest before you do it again so now there is also another variation you can do just by simply using a tennis ball because what i want you to do now is that you do exactly the same thing and just move the tennis ball around your waist at the same time not becoming slower with your feet okay so this is going to be a bit of a challenge [Music] very good that's it okay much more difficult right you see just by simply adding the tennis ball so that your nervous system has to do also to act on a on another movement makes it so much harder but that is what you need to do in the game and that is how you can improve your speed because always be prepared to be able to run and accelerate in each direction that what makes you a better football player so simple things sometimes a simple variation is helping you to improve your speed to become better
