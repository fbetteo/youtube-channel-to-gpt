[Music] training practices for junior players under six and seven training practices for children playing opto small-sided football in the under six and seven age groups should focus on four major themes these are running with the ball passing and striking the ball one versus one and first touch themi Running With The Ball steal the eggs set up an area 20x 20 M place an even number of players at each corner and one more ball per Corner than players in that corner for example if there are two players in a corner there needs to be three balls on the coach's call all players run to Any Corner collect a ball with their feet and run with it at their feet back to their own Corner players cannot protect their own balls in their corner and obstruct other players set a time limit of 1 minute and see which corner has the most balls at the end of one minute challenge the players by asking them to use their opposite foot Fox and Hounds set up an area 20 by 20 M Mark a 5 m line from each of the ends the Fox starts on the 5 m line with a ball and the Hound starts on the edge of the area 5 m behind the fox without a ball on the coach's core the fox runs with the ball at their feet as quickly as they can to the other end of the area the Hound has to try and run across the end line before the fox gets there with the ball you May challenge players by encouraging them to use their other foot or adding a goal 2 m in width at the end but stress a player cannot shoot before they reach the 5 m end line theme passing striking the ball pass it straight set up as many rectangular areas as you need 10 m long by 5 m wide the player is at each end of the rectangle with the ball at one end place a ball on top of a marker at the halfway point in the rectangle you can use only a ball or marker if you don't have enough of either the players pass the ball back and forth trying to knock the ball off the marker or just hit the target each player counts how many times they are successful to challenge players encourage them to also use their non-preferred foot to pass the ball or increase the Distance by one pace each time they hit the target to ensure people continue to work at an appropriate level many goals set up an area 30X 30 m within the area use markers to set up small goals of 2 m in width have one more set of goals than the number of pairs you have have divide your group into Pairs and give each pair a ball on the coach's call instruct the players to move around the area passing the ball through the goals to their partner each successful pass through a goal scores one point set a time limit of 2 minutes and ask each pair how many points they scored challenge players by encouraging them to use their non-preferred foot to pass the ball decreasing the size of the goals or ask them to play a return path to their partner through the goals to score theme 1 V1 1 V1 on four goals set up a 15x 15 M area set up two goals 2 m in width at each end of the area each goal should be 2 m in from the corner of the playing area at both ends the players are divided into two groups and line up at each end of the area between the two sets of goals the coach stands on the side of the area and passes the ball into the area to one of the players it is then a contest between the players to dribble or pass the ball into either of the two goals they are running towards have multiple balls and start the next pair immediately after the pair before finish to ensure the practice is continuous don't let the contests last more than 20 seconds to ensure you keep the interest of players Chas and return set up a 15x 15 M area set up three goals of 2 m in width at the end of the area the goals should be positioned in each corner and the middle of the end line the players are divided into two groups and line up on either side of the middle goal on the end line the coach passes the ball into the middle of the area from the end line and the first player from each line chases the ball the first player to get to the ball attacks towards the three goals and attempts to beat their opponent by dribbling or passing the ball through any of these three goals if the defending player wins the ball they must run with it as quickly as they can over the opposite end line have multiple balls and start the next pair immediately after the pair before finish to ensure the practice is continuous don't let the contest last more than 20 seconds to ensure you keep the interest of players theme first touch control and shoot set up a 15x 15 M area set up a goal of 2 m in width in the middle of each line of the area this means there are four goals in total divide your players into pairs one player stands with a ball at their feet next to each goal the partners stand in the middle of the area facing their partner the player with the ball passes the ball into into their partner in the middle of the area who controls the ball and shoots into the goal they are facing the player who passes the ball after doing so moves quickly behind the goals and controls the ball after it moves through the goals with their feet after several turns swap the players over challenge the player in the middle by asking them to control the ball and score in the goal on their left and right or use their nonpreferred foot 4v4 on four goals set up a 15x 15 M area set up a goal of 2 m in width in the middle of each line of the area this means there are four goals in total divide your group into two teams of four players the teams play 4v4 football Let each team know they have two designated goals to score in the coach passes the ball into the area to start the game
