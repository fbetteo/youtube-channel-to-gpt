welcome to week one today's theme is welcome to soccer getting comfortable with the ball and your surroundings our first game is Sharks and Minnows as a warm-up game in the game of Sharks and Minnows the coach is the shark and the children are the minnows the shark attempts to hit the minnows with the ball and The Minnow must lie down another minnow must jump over the Frozen minnow and this allows him or her to get back up and into the game we can play for about 5 or 10 minutes but the kids will always want to play longer they love running around jumping over their Frozen minnow friends they're working on agility Vision speed overcoming fear of failure taking risks it's a great game for the development of children and most importantly as I said before they love it our standard three stretches will be the butterfly the Flamingo and jumping jacks these three will be repeated in each of the eight weeks and three new stretches will be added each week to add variety in this activity the cone Maze We spread the cones randomly all over the field players dribble their soccer balls attempting not to hit the cones goals may be added to the outsides instruct the players to use both the inside and outside of the feet a final activity is to have the children dribble around the course and hit the cones when they hit a cone they pick it up this is good for passing accuracy and a fun way to clean up the course cone maze is great for developing motor skills in children while they're learning to change the direction of the ball while running and it's a lot of fun the running activity is an agility course we have a number of different activities to use in this exercise coaches can vary the activities as they see fit speed ladder slalom running or shuffling hopping Sprint first station is the speed ladder this offers lots of variations on foot speed development you may also consult the instruction booklet that comes with the speed ladder the second station is the giant slalom children Shuffle in and out of the cones emphasis is on technique of bending the knees as we change directions station three is hopping we teach two footed takeoff and one footed takeoff the fourth station is sprinting the children Sprint from the starting cones to the ending cones our running activity for the day is the agility core course this is an excellent opportunity for kids to just have fun and run in many different ways they're jumping they're shuffling they're changing directions they're running backwards it's great for their Fitness and for their agility in our final game of the day Sharks and Minnows we change things up by having the parents serve as sharks a fun alternative is to have the kids become the Sharks and the parents become the minnows today's theme getting comfortable with the ball is supported by these activities in a very fun way kids are working on motor skill development soccer skill development they're having a ton of fun and their Fitness level is also increasing it's all built around the experimentation with play
