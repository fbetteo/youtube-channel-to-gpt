hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant and healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do I can hear the song of a bird and I can feel the [Music] sky I know that that I'm part of the earth when I see the sunrise I am thankful to be [Music] here my guest today is the remarkable Karen Sanders Karen has been working with plants I would say for all of her life she was trained in Native American traditional plant medicine as a child an apprentice with the Mexican kandera while still in her teens today she's a practicing clinical herbalist and educator and along with her partner herbalist Sarah Holmes they run the blue Otter School of herbal medicine which is located on one of the most beautiful places on the planet on Mount Shasta in Northern California the school is not only known for its really comprehensive Med herbal medicine programs um but also for its ability to train herbalists how to become true healers Karen's a really popular and respected teacher at herbal conferences in fact I might say she's one of the most beloved teachers at all of the conferences that I host and she travels throughout the United States maybe the world sharing her unique and insightful approach to herbalism Karen's also been hosting this amazing and very popular radio program called The herbal Highway which I think she's been head on air since 1997 which makes it if I've done my math right about 25 years and what's so amazing to me is that she had me as a guest on her program a number of years ago that was quite an honor for me like most herbalists that I know Karen is amazingly dedicated to her work to the plants and the Earth but what makes her work so unique is her ability to fully immerse her clients and students in the healing world of herbs teaching them how to stand fully in their own power as healers I don't I don't think that Karen knows this but among herbalists among the people that I know Karen is known as a teacher of teachers and the Healer of herbal healers she lives and teaches from the Paradigm that the plant people are our first beings our elders and our teachers and that they hold the oldest and the wisest knowledge so it's just a great honor to welcome you here Karen with me today I also just want to add one other thing Karen and I share a real love of old Mercedes hot rods and I've had the great honor riding around with Caren actually in the 1986 Mercedes convertible she was driving and it was a wild drive so thank you Karen for for joining me today oh it is my pleasure and my honor thank you thank you so much yeah I'd like to focus a lot of our talk today um on your indigenous connection to the plants I know that's really re really unique and also your early training but I'm always interested and I think other people are also in the story of how you became interested in herbs how you found plants or really it's really about how the plants found you so do you mind sharing a little bit of that early story with us it came through my family because my grandmother was a medicine person and they all do plants and I guess they saw something in me really young and so I was the one that was was picked you know and so I've definitely had a connection to plants but also to animals just as strongly which is a strong part of Plant medicine I think westerners don't use that as much but most native people's that's a real mix the plants and the animals and their medicines so that's pretty much how I got started and then I formerly trained for seven years all the time and then my grandma passed and then I found another teacher to finish up the 10 years and then like you said I trained with Kura just because that's what I had grown up around in La East LA so okay yeah I wondered how that happened you know how you found a a Mexican kadero so you were growing up were you actually in the city or in the country outside I did a mix of being way in the country and being in the city ah so I'm very good at doing both I don't know I'm not good at suburbs but I'm good at the other two so you're saying that I realize you're a bridge Walker in that way as well you know like so many people are really familiar with country living or city living or really really uh well informed about herbal medicine or allopathic medicine you are such a bridge Walker in so many traditions and ways of being it's really beautiful yeah yeah so so your grandmother was your first teacher as well yes yeah yes and you know I didn't know know her because my other grandmother passed before I was born but my aunties on that side would say oh that's all we did was herbal medicine and honestly Rosemary I think because of our age our grandparents were born in the late 1800s so everybody nobody did Al apathic I guess if you really were rich or something but you know everybody was doing herbal medicine yeah I I would always say this about my grandmother as well Karen is my grandmother was an herbalist but she would never call herself that she just worked with plants and she was my first teacher as well but it wasn't like a formal for me it wasn't a formal training she just would take me out to the garden and she would show me which plants to put in the edible basket and which in the medicine basket it was a very it was more a way of life for them right honestly what that was that was formal training to us you know they it wasn't formal like oh here's your class it was like you were with them every day and they made made sure just by talking to you and while having you watched that you learned everything so in a way I think that is formal training you know I see yes I see what you're saying yeah and it's interesting because when you when you grow up and you see all the people using Pharmaceuticals that's foreign to you right it's not what was much more natural was you know the natur using the herbs and the plants what didn't feel so comfortable or safe was the Pharmaceuticals it was just a very different perspective of how of how both of us grew up oh absolutely and it's interesting because at 60 I had to see a doctor and he was like oh you're really healthy then he's like you're not taking any Pharmaceuticals and I laughed I go you just tell me I'm healthy why would I be on it why would I use that yeah you know and then I laughed I said well that's why I'm healthy yeah you know it is yeah that's really really excellent point it is interesting how it is as people do get older and I would say here older would be considered like you know 60 or older that it's normal for people to be on medication and yet yeah it's yeah like you say yeah so I also was wanted to ask you like do you recall a first experience with plants that really stuck out at you that you wouldn't mind sharing with us you know like when they kind of talk to you when they kind of pull you in yes like that yes I have a lot um I just remember it didn't occur to me they were talking to me but everyone but I would hear things like I'd hear them say and it wasn't always like oh here's how to use me a lot of times it was like you need to be quiet or you're walking too fast you know when I was a kid they would they would teach me how to be around them yeah and I remember one time my auntie was we used to get um they used to have Rose Court sitting around and where she lived and they would use them in the gardens in the four corners and then when to go the hills and get them and then they put them back you know you'd mark it and after the garden was done the vegetable garden you put them back and we were walking up and she was like I said who's that and she said just be quiet and I said but who's that who's singing and she said just be quiet and then we came around a corner and I realized it was the rose quartz oh wow you know and she just said just be quiet but I realized everybody has a voice and everybody talks to each other yeah you know a child it became so clear to me that if I opened up and was quiet I could hear everything what a powerful teaching and the fact that the fact that your was your auntie who was telling you this was your grandmother your aun yeah just the fact that they Auntie yeah that they would know that you know that's such a powerful I mean most adults are still learning I mean I think that's probably what you do at your school right is you teach people how to be quiet and listen because people talk about so often your students I've heard them talking about how that probably is the most powerful teaching for them when they go to your school they they learn all of the educational components of herbalism you know all the physical components and even the spiritual but more than anything it's an immersion into themselves I think that's one of the I mentioned that a little bit in the introduction I think it's one of the things about your work that so many of your students honor you for is this ability to really open up to and listen to them the world around them and also to themselves you know it's a full immersion but you got you could do that easily right because because I was going to ask you that how did you discover to work that into your program but I realized now when we're speaking you got that when you were a child yeah it was it was part of the teaching yeah it was definitely and part of what I saw around me you know I don't know if you did this Rosemary but a southern custom was you would go outside every day you know like all ages and you'd sit either on a porch or in the yard and nobody would talk and you listen to the wind and maybe someone would say oh listen look at that and you would it was just to be it was just to be with the wind and the plants and the area and each other and then people would just kind of float off back to work and what they were doing wow but it was a given that you would stop and you would pay attention to where you were and give that you know give that your time and your your presence yeah that's really very very powerful H when you asked if I did that I think about sitting on the porch with my five brothers and sisters I don't think there was ever a moment of quiet actually but I did find that quiet yeah we were very noisy when we would sit on the porch we were all squawking together but I did find that quiet that you're speaking about I remember Rosemary the first time I visited you not at a conference but at your home and I was with Amy and we went out in your garden and we just sat on this big rock and we had moments of just being quiet and kind of present and then moments where we were just talking and laughing you know and it reminded me of that like oh yeah so that's probably partly what your students talk about when they go to the blue Otter and also when you come and teach other places that you're teaching them to listen deeply because they you know I have to say that I I have a lot of my friends who are herbalist themselves who have been trained and who many years and have taught others and have their own schools who have come to study with you and they feel like more than anything they learn a lot about the plants for certain but they learn mostly about themselves it seems to be one of your great skills is to help people you know really stand fully in the power of who they are and how to be a really heartful intuned healer yeah I I truly believe that as a as a you know like a practitioner when you're doctoring someone when you're just doing her you're not really doing it you're kind of this conduit that lets that kind of just you know hears things and takes it to people but I think the most important thing is that people understand that you're kind of just getting them back in their power and Trauma just takes you out of your power and so the whole point of a session or anything is to lead someone back to themselves and to set them you know real let them realize their power has always been there and I think to me that's what I I think we're supposed to be doing you know it's not so much oh they're sick of course you deal with that but you're sick because things have happened and you've gotten out of balance and it takes everything you know all those levels of ourselves so I I do think that that you can only go as deeply with the plants or deeply with someone else as you're willing to do with yourself so I think it's important that you take the Deep dive you know yeah I think that I think working with plants I think we have one of the greatest tools of all because the plants like you were saying that conduit I always used to say to myself like every time before I would see a person who was coming to see me for some healing work I'd always just pray you know make me an empty Channel which which the voice of the plants and spirit can work through because they just are using us as channels as I maybe it's like that in other forms of medicine as well but I know what plants it definitely works that way you know they just they're using us aren't they to do their healing work and and also the more refined tun we are with them the more they can work with us so that's probably that part of that process of yeah and being able to go inside someone you know with permission obviously but to see inside and just let yourself see what's there and then you know figure out okay they're really not here for what they said they're here for something else and how do we get to that you know where do we start that that journey to that oh that was very interesting Ken I want to know um like I love the part you said always asking permission when you journey into somebody but can you talk about that process are you able to describe how it is that you are able to see into people is that something you can describe because not everybody has that or if they do have it they have it practic it yeah I think that's honestly sometimes I think that's it and you know other people people have gifts for certain things everybody has their gift you know and I was able to do that and I think it's more just being so present and fully opening up to the connection and then asking can we work together can I go in there and then letting yourself it's about following energy more than anything and so you know we're always you know our energies are always flowing in and out of each other so if you get on the ride then there you are you know that's beautiful you can see you can I love that line that you use you're following the energy that actually helps me understand that's what you're doing you're follow because that's actually that's you use that word often times you know the energetic working with the energetic energy of the plants you know and so that's a lot of what that is even with the plants isn't it you want to talk about that a little more if you can yeah it's you know it everything's energy I was just talking to some Advanced students and I was just they were saying well you know there's the physical and then you know we'll do the spirit stuff and I'm like the physical is energy it's not solid it's yeah it's it it's matter slowed down you know so you can like grasp it that's all it is it's Just Energy oh so it is about everything is connected because everything is energy and if you trust that I think and you understand that and allow yourself to feel it and see it then you can always move with that and that's why with some people it's just an easier connection because they're kind of there too yeah you know or they're willing yeah and you're feeling more energy yeah I think when you I think maybe that's why it's I I'm guessing and you can correct me if I'm if I have this wrong but I have a sense that when you're working with those students who come to your place to really humbly want to be healers and to help heal the Earth and heal one another they are more attuned with that energy in themselves right so it's usually easier to work with those people right they're able because they want to breathe in that energy and understand it am I right in saying that they come open but some have no idea what that means and some say I can't do that and of course those are the ones that end up having the most connection you know the ones that are like I don't get it I can't do it by the end it's like H yeah you can but you know it's very hard Rose Mary you know I come from a different paradig so I'm realizing how hard it is for people to shift paradigms and to cross the veils and the dimensions because you know how I perceive things is not a western way so it you know you have to figure out how do I say this that would be understood in from that perspective oh that's interesting can you can you share a little bit about that perspective with us you have been but I'm just wondering if you want to explore that a little more with us well just that we're in different dimensions and I mean you cross that all the time that's why it's easy for you to understand yeah you know um yeah so I think it's just an understanding that there's no hierarchy every being every energy is connected and we're supposed to be and we get out of balance because we get harmed by other beings or we get lost in ourselves or with technology oh man I've really seen it where it takes people out of themselves it's like come over here don't be here yeah it's really true you know people it's it's like a actually physical sucking of the Soul it can leave people feeling so unbelievably depleted and lost you know like anytime that we're given a new tool learning how to use it is really difficult but the training for how to use it is not there you know so people are not they're not tool that's damaging and it's so powerful and people are they're using it so improperly that it's causing a Darkness on the planet right now oh I think so too and it's harming even just bird migration but really I think if you can get people in their proper power you know personal power not like that power that wants to seek others then you start to like understand and slow down and go maybe this isn't right and you start to heal yeah and once those connections start being made then you get in Balance then you kind of get it you know it you kind of come out of it so honestly I think our work is to just lead people back to their hearts and their s and let them understand that you're always got light and vibration in you no matter what it's happened you can't be fully broken because that connection is there with everything and I think once you can get people to understand that and feel that in themselves then they're you know then they're there yeah I think that's very powerful so is that what healing is for you you know that was one of the questions I wanted to just I wanted to hear your your thoughts about is you know what healing is but I think that that may have answered it right yeah I feel like it's when your energy understanding your energy within yourself so you know when it's flowing properly you know that's spiraling and going up and down and you know you know through the Earth and up to you know the galaxies and back but also I believe it's when you're feeling Balan you know all those Mind Body Spirit physical you know they're all in Balance yeah and you can realize that trauma is something that happens to you it's not who you are yeah you know and once you understand that like yeah like oh I I'm not bad I'm whatever it's just something that happened and it got in the way of access to personal power yeah which is its intention yeah it's it's a major thing right now right so many people are dealing with personal trauma and planetary trauma and yeah the grief and the sorrow yeah it's it's a lot to lift up isn't it it's a lot to lift up and it's a lot to you know there's there's ongoing traumas there's societal traumas but I think you know once you learn how to be in your power and have boundaries and understand how to move energy then you kind of can deal with things in a way that's allowing you to be fully present in yourself and to you know have your potential because everybody has that right everybody has the right to their full potential you're doing powerful work Karen I I I see you as kind of like one of those uh I well I used to use it's a funny way to explain it but I was used to I think it was maybe um from Ram Doss or Stephen gask and it goes back a long time where they talked about you know being a uh like a vacuum cleaner on the side of a dirty Corner in the city or something and you would just be bringing in all of that energy that sometimes was toxic and stuff and just cleaning up and sending it back out into the world you know and I I kind of see that you do that when you work with people you know you you're not doing it for them but you're showing them the way to how to take all of that trauma and all of the things going on and just how to to run it through yourself in a much stronger and more powerful way and then what you're putting out into the world is is far more healing than that toxic energy that sometimes is coming out of us so I just see that your work is Holy work in that way and you sort of do it very quietly oh thanks Rosemary are you still up on the mountain I heard rumors that you were thinking the school is that true yes yes it's not a rumor so um yeah yeah it's not a rumor I'm ready for some I've been in the mountains and I'm ready for some ocean work oh I understand to connect with those beings yeah I do understand you definitely I did that same migration I lived your landl yeah but I'm living on a big body of water now right so I moved from the mountains where I liveed for 35 years to the lake and it's very healing and soothing I would say the water is soothing and it's yeah people don't understand that that you know that lake is looks like an ocean when you're standing at it you can't even see some of the far side it's called the Inland sea it's powerful it is so sweetie I wanted to ask you also about um I know that a lot of your pro with herbs is is like as food as our everyday you know food the food that we eat and the herbs and do you want to just share a little bit about how you see that food is medicine I think we used to um food was medicine you know everything people ate was intentional to be medicine in the body so people would go collect medicinal mushrooms and they just called it food you know and people you know I mean and and people cooked with you know you know what I mean it wasn't like oh that's medicinal people would put the herbs into like spices like you look at something like simple as gumbo which isn't simple it's a very complex dish but basically it's Fela and F is Saif and Saif was used to thicken things but it was also used to clean not just the blood from Winter to Spring but it was used to change the energy from going in for the winter to coming out again so you know there was so many medicines that were just part of everyday tea and food and I think honestly it's the best way to do it I think I really try and get people to understand like teas and and food should be how you take them and then when things get really you know you get really out of balance then you go A step above and you got to get you know straight up you know think about it deeper exactly My Philosophy I think just the same you know it's like if you get people drinking their eating their herbs and drinking their teas and going out and you know Gathering their wild dandelion and a little bit of plantain and berock and just putting it in your food as every day chances are that you'll need the the rare medicine plants less often you know when we talk a lot about plant conservation I think one of the things I see is that the rarer plants the woodland plants or the plants that are very specific in habitat are you know that don't readily multiply are almost always those plants that are used for serious illness but the everyday common weeds are the is healthy you know and they travel by humans they they you know they they grow around our footsteps and say here we are use us you know yeah I and got traded and and you know all the berries and the oh gosh I just one of my favorite teas is this time of year when you can go and they're actually about to go do a spruce tip Harvest and a Doug fur Harvest the tips it's so good because that was such a spring medicine yeah and it's all vitamins it just gives you so much you know I honestly I feel sad because where we live we've been in a drought for oh my gosh it's going on eight years it's really bad it's the worst year ever this year so I haven't been able to take the tips because I don't feel okay about taking the tip of a plant that's barely having some because they're in such a stressed condition oh yeah I totally understand and I think that's the thing I think herbalists have to understand because I believe with some people especially with West herbalist there was this understanding that the herbs belong to them and that wasn't my teaching you had to earn the right yeah and you had to tend them and take care of them so you understood like you don't do that in the drought and there's a powerful that connection and yeah that's beautiful I I I love that and you know it's interesting I I feel like I live that way but just hearing you say it is such an incredible reminder to me I think that's one of the things that we do for one another I think so many of these teachings yes some they're foreign to some people but a lot of people we know them but we have to be reminded now you know we have to be reminded over and over again that it's not about taking I'm I'm also a little worried about it you know I spent so many years teaching people how to go and gather plants and mushrooms you know and wild things and now it's so exciting to see so many people people doing it but there's not enough of the there's not enough of wild things to supply the huge needs and demands so you know I'm looking at I know yeah what do you think about that but you know Rosemary I think that the greatest thing you can teach someone is to grow a plant because there you go when you start something from a little seed or you have such a connection and I saw it in my students you know we let them in the garden which a lot of people we had a huge Garden for them and we had different sections we had a woodland SE in the middle of where I live there's a woodland section with plants from where you live I had a Plains Prairie section I mean you know I had a bog because I'm like I have to have my calamus in my monset so oh my goodness once they were in charge of a section or growing it everything changed they got very protective they tell people to slow down once you create life and have to tend it it Chang changes everything and I think if people grew their medicines and even just one plant people say how do you hear the plants how do you connect to them grow them sit with them every day water them that's the that is your connection you know there's this fallacy that you have to have wild plants for them to be powerful medicine and you know in all Native Villages there was medicine Gardens right there that we planted intentionally Nobody needs Nobody wants to walk four miles to get something so you had your everyday medicine you know what I mean and you had your everyday medicines right near you and then you had the ones like you said for really intense illness that you would go get you know and you would go find so I I do think we have to teach people that you have to I think if every herbalist and every plant person went out and planted properly like what the families our native plants in the proper places and did that we would start seeing them again yeah because yeah you know what I'm saying if you take if you take one plant and you have the the thought that I should plant seven or eight or nine or ten in its place you don't run out of stuff but that hasn't happened you know it could and I think it is happening more it has to become an essential part of all herbal education the problem is is that I think it was becoming it but it herbal sort of exploded in the internet which is a you know beautiful how it's you know introduced so many people to plants but some of the foundational teachings that are so important are not there um but one of the things I agree with that yeah you know I know um early on like say in the 1970s when I when I first started teaching people about plants I was I definitely was teaching people about using wild plants mostly the weedy species because I'm a I'm a weed eater right but it was it was because the quality of the plants was not so good you know it was everything was there was no organic organic wasn't even a word at that time right sustainable and fair trade you know those are those came 30 years later but today it's totally different because you can cultivate so we used to sell people tell people you know if you really want good quality in the essence of wildness and the essence of the plants you you have to go out and you know gather your own in the wild but it's totally different today BEC because of the things that you said but also because we have really thoughtful farmers who are growing high quality organic plants that are charged with energy you know so they have that Vitality that oh you know totally right and they have people singing to them and harvesting beautifully and and like you said of course if people grow themselves but even in the herb stores today you can get really high quality so I'm like you I feel feel like we have to really change the teachings in a big way from using the wild to using cultivated and ideally organically you know sensitive beautifully cultivated you know they're still wild especially if you plant them as they're intended with their families because that's what makes the medicine yeah you know people don't understand it's not coincidence that those plants grow with each other they're a family they're a family and like cousins and uncles they're a family and if you grow them in that way like a a woodland bed where they're all there yeah then the medicine is huge because all of those make the medicine yeah and so that's also a really wonderful thing is get them to plant like here's a prairie bed this is all who should be here here's actually who lives in a in The Woodlands together you know that's beautiful what came to my mind when you were talking was you're talking about cultivating wildness right in families and I'm thinking we really need to do that same thing with humans because humans are are lacking the Wild Spirit right now that makes us tough and tenacious and able to survive the tides and storms so so we need to kind of bring that Wild Spirit back into our own lives I I totally agree I you know when we did the Woodland bed it took us three years to get the soil right and I was taught to taste soil and smell it you know there's a certain sweetness and and then one of the students was from she grew up in Wisconsin and she walked in there and said oh this this is it it smells exactly like the woods and oh and we knew it was right when all of a sudden Morel started showing up in that wood bed without being planted yeah we were like okay it's it's ready you know that's amazing yeah you know you just get excited I think if people just you know I was in New York City I lived in Manhattan I had an herb garden I had I was on the top I was right by the tar roof I Had It Up on the Roof you know I'm like you can have it anywhere really you are bridge walking across the Skyliner again I knew it yeah I love that I I love how you travel between the worlds Karen you know both on this planet you know in a solid physical form or matter slowed down as you were saying I love that image but also I love how you can travel in the other Realms as well it you know and I think some of that comes through genetic you know how things are passed down through our ancestors but also and also some of your training and then just also some of your choice you know I think that many people have the ability but they're never shown how to do that and so they feel stuck in this one dimension which is quite boring yeah it is boring and I think they get scared you know scary it it can be scary at first but then once you realize oh we're meant to do that we know our you know we know how to come back to ourselves then it becomes less scary it's more scary when you when you think you can't actually really you know the I I agree totally yeah it's so wonderful I think that's one of the things about sacred plant medicine I mean I think it's used very abusively and you know people use a lot of these very sacred plants that are rare and have been traditionally used for Spiritual Journeys by people since the beginning of time but still used rightly today you know they can help people step out of the three-dimensional world that they think they live in 100% but you know I had a student say Karen would you talk about hallucinogens and how I know you agree with them and I said well those are used in a ceremonial way for an intent purpose but I said what people don't understand is every single plan spiritual can take you to another dimension yeah is spiritual and I have had more I took yo we were doing intentional um meditations together where we would meditate with a plant then come together and talk about it because of Zoom you know and I had one of the biggest G you know what I mean and pandemic stuff and I had one of the biggest galaxy teachings I've ever had from Yo wow like yeah you don't have to just have limit yourself to those plants if you open yourself they have they're all spiritual sacred galactic Travelers you know that's a beautiful way of saying it you know there's a I don't know if you know the work of a woman named Carol guay she's from Ireland and she wrote a beautiful book called sacred plant initiations and what she's doing in this book is exactly what you're talking about she's teaching people how to do dietas or the diet sacred ceremonies but with plantain and Yaro and she teaches these meditation she does a really good job in that book teaching just what what you're saying I I do want to recommend that book for people who are listening because she's you know she is taking she is showing people that you can use Yaro to have a galactic experience and I and I know that's true exactly but I think it is a lot I think the plants are they function a lot like plant the plant teachers function a lot like we human teachers where you have these really powerful teachers that hit you over the head with a frying pan kind of rip your heart open or you have those that do it more gently and those PL PLS that are known as you know this hallucinogenics or the those spiritual journey plants they often are the ones you don't have a barrier you you can't say no when you when they start to take you you know we're a plant like y it's not that you can't just don't want to say no you just want to say yes because it leads you powerfully but also gently oh yeah no it's make it yeah you're right you know some plants if you ask them to give you medicine they're not going to hear no and you should couldn't ask a plant to give you medicine and then say no you know yeah any if you drink an herbal tea you need to open to that yeah you have to open to that to that experience Karen do you think that you could explain how you can drink Yaro tea and have that kind of sacred experience could you just to share that process yeah you know well first I took it and then I was like and I was sitting by my altar because it was I think the first thing is to show up you have to be present okay and you have to make that agreement with the pl that you will be don't ask someone to show up if you're not gonna and then I was sitting at the Al and I took it and I'm like go yeah right and I thought oh it's not working and then I thought okay I think it's me so I took a little more and then I just made myself go deeper and then the next thing I know Bang there I was getting this beautiful teaching and honestly I think it was just me being present and opening up and saying if you want to show me something I'll come to you I think that we're always asking the plants to come to us when we forget to say I will come to you and you can take me where you want to take me you know you know what I mean it's like I do it's like if someone comes to be with you you know when they're really there and when they're not you know and the plants are smarter than us they're our elders they have way more wisdom than we do they certainly know when you're Faking It know and that's use for a lot of your students isn't it like I um you know I've shared I talked to a lot of your students who are very close friends of mine and they talk about how they show up for the plants and then how the plants really show up for them and that that's probably the process right there right yeah yeah it I think it is I really think it is I mean yeah yeah I just wanted to share as you were speaking right then a big blue hair and just went right by the window it's so beautiful to see it oh well that's that's a clan medicine so yeah yeah yeah I mean that's a good that's a good omen Rosemary I thought it was a good omen you just got given some medicine I took it as a gift for you that honestly it's the relationship are you are we going to have a relationship with the world and that includes the you know the skies the waters the Underworld the in world the all beings are are we going to have a relationship are we going to show up and say I want to know you and I'm going to let you see me and with plants that's the most powerful thing you can do I'm gonna let you see me and I I really want to see you that's hard huh you know yes it's harder said than done you know we're human we have all kinds of other stuff in us that gets in the way yeah it's the most powerful thing it's the most powerful thing honey yeah it is I hope when you move move to the ocean and I totally understand why if you've been in drought for seven years your soul is craving for moisture yeah so are you gonna continue your school there are you you're gonna continue your teachings right honestly Rosary the way we teach is so intense we literally hold people on an energetic plane for four months four days a week six hours a day and I'm getting to the age where I don't know that I have that so we're going to teach differently but I'm only teaching honestly I just want to work with things to go deep because it's just you know how that is you must be there you just want to work with people and things that are you know you're they're gonna go there they're gonna try you know and are you gonna have some way that you're gonna um what would be the word you know not s it out yeah you I wish you know yeah I wish but you know honestly there are people so excited um about this medicine and there's a group up there I really want to give these teachings to a group of you know indigenous people and I mean all indigen not just you know one I use that word too thank you yeah I want to make sure that happens and I mean you come from that you're Armenian you know it's like yeah it's deep ly deeply deeply in you you know it is yeah so yeah we'll keep teaching probably in a different style you know it's good to change every now and then sometimes it's with the Cycles as we grow older and it's not even so much I always say it's not so much older in age it's just when you started so you've been teaching in this method and taking it deeper and deeper and then spirit is asked you to change for me Spirit asked me to step in step outside the circle for a while and I realized once I did it it was because I had another enormous transformation and process I had to go through that really helped my work with the Holy and the spiritual but nothing that I ever would ever have anticipated or expected or wanted but I think what the really important teaching is is you have to continue to listen even when it doesn't make sense to you you know like even even when oh you have to grow yeah you're right and you the thing is the beauty of it is I people can hear what you just said you were willing to accept that that's the key right there you can't grow if you're not willing to accept it and when it's scary and when it's isolating and when it's more than you wanted but you stay there I think that's it I knew with my work both in the medicine and just the teaching I had to work on myself every day or I couldn't do it I can't do my work without it I I knew that I knew that I had to see my stuff in order to to be able to work with people and you know that you know and uh I think that's the key I think it's not about teaching the plants it's about doing our personal work at the same time that we're working with others yeah I think that's the most powerful part yeah I did I wanted to just mention that thing about fear you know like I think that always when there's that when you're called to do really big change that has to do with something in yourself or leaving behind what seems like you're leaving behind something that you really love you almost always confront fear it's not I want to I always oh yeah it's not easy you but you always have to say yes to the voice that you hear if so long as you cultivate that listening to that voice because we can get a lot of different voices in our heads we have to really learn to cultivate listening to our spirit voice you know I think that's but when that voice is telling you it's time for change boy you better do it you know even if it is you got do it and the thing is even if it's scary and the thing is everything's scary I mean you you're going to have to say yes to fear in life people live in fear it's a matter of do you want to live in one that's ridiculous or do you want to live in the fear that's going to take you to be a more Huger person you know um a more connected person that's so beautiful you know we all have fear so we get to choose which one we follow you know there's just something first of all I still that just fills me my hope is filling the hearts of the people listening and the other thing that I don't know if I look like this but the picture that I'm getting of you is not super clear but it's like a spirit I keep seeing the spirit painting of you it's really like energy is swirling all over you I don't know do I look like that to you because that's I think it's perfect actually yeah you know I know that's how you operate and I just I just want it first happened I thought because it's always clear right but in this and what I'm getting is more of a spirit image of you which I think is beautiful but it does it fills my heart well thank you because that means you're actually well I I thank you because it means you're willing to see me you know no you get this Rosemary I mean you walk in spirit you know you you really walk in spirit and you have a lot of patience I've often like how can she be so patient but um you know I'm crabby I'm like but I think we just have to open our hearts and that's scary that's scary but I have to say I had a lot of fear when I was a kid you know circumstances things and I started to realize early on you can't not have pain you or fear in your life it's part of life yes so you need to choose the right ones you know you need to choose the right fear of growing or the pain of growing and not go to the ones that don't lead you anywhere but smallness you know yeah that's powerful we can make a conscious choice to choose the kind of fear that we want to confront and grow with I love that I had never really thought about that before exactly yeah yeah because you just do it naturally Rosemary that's why you don't think about it I've watched you you know I have such respect for you because I know what's been going on and I'm like oh yeah she's just whether she wants it or not she's going in and so she's gonna come out more you know even though you're gonna lose stuff you come out more you have to be willing to give up things that are most of value to you in the world you know there's that there's that part of the of the Holy work I think but yeah I've had a lot of good teachers it's true I think we're coming sort of the end of our time I could talk to you forever Karen honestly I should I'm gonna sign up for one of your programs but I did want to just ask um this is a really broad question and sometimes it's hard when you get throwing these but do you have any final words that you just would like to leave us to ponder or anything that you'd like to add that we that you feel is really important at this moment honestly I think I would just want to say to someone that if they could understand that their light and vibration and their and and basically everything in the universe is in them and to Fe to just somehow trust in that no matter what is going on or what has happened to you and to know that that's what's going to guide you I think that would be the thing I would say to people you know I think we'll just take a moment all of us and just sit here for one minute in quiet and let that fill us up thank you so much Karen for just taking time out of your life being with us I had so much more I wanted to ask you but I'll have it's been a pleasure it's been an absolute pleasure I look forward to like oh we'll get to see each other at one point you know We're Dreaming it up again you know it's got to happen so I love you dearly thank you much thank you I love you too I am thankful to be here I am thankful to [Music] be
