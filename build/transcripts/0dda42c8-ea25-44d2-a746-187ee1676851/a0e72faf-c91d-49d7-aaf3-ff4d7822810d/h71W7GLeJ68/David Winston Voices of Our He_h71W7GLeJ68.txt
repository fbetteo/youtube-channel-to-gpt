hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began the herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant and healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do [Music] when I see the sun rise I am thankful to be here [Music] my welcome and esteemed guest today is David Winston David is not only a well-known herbalist he is also a dear friend of mine he's trained in Chinese Western eclectic and Southeastern herbal medicine and he combines these Traditions seamlessly in his practice he's been in clinical practice for 47 years and is the founder and Dean of the David Winston Center for Herbal studies which offers an extensive two-year clinical training program he's also founder and president of herbalist and Alchemist one of our really well-known herbal manufacturing companies and he just produces incredible excellent products Davis the author of several of my favorite her books including the author of The immensely popular adaptogens herbs for strength stamina and stress relief it actually was the first book to come out on adaptogens and really introduce this amazing group of herbs to the world David's won numerous awards for his herbal work including an honorary doctorate from the National University of natural medicine and really there's so many more things that David's done but for a complete you can go to our website David thank you so much for joining me today it's really an honor and a privilege to have you here well Rosemary it is just a I I could say the same it's an honor it's a privilege and I'm thrilled to be your guest today and to have a chance to talk tell stories reminisce well let's get going you know I always love hearing the story of the aha moment when the plants uh saved you or called you into this magical green world do you mind just sharing a little bit about that with us I'd be happy to although it's kind of a convoluted story I wouldn't call it one moment it's it's like a series of moments and so I have to start off by talking about being a really young child and um at at our age we are too old to have been diagnosed with all the things that people get diagnosed with today so yes I would have been diagnosed as having ADHD except it didn't exist when I was a kid and dyslexia I had all sorts of learning disabilities and on top of that I'm sort of a challenging combination on a personality level of being a shy introvert I was the little kid walking around with a sign on my back saying kick me beat me up and steal my lunch and by the way also that didn't did happen and so I found people somewhat difficult and challenging and literally frightening but rocks and plants and trees were really nice and by the way what I did play it was mostly with girls because they were nicer yes so they would let me play with them well I spent an inordinate amount of time as a young child in the woods and we had a beautiful Farm in woods right behind our home our home was very sort of urban Suburban kind of home but right behind us was this really beautiful Old Farm and I just spent hours and hours days and days more often by myself in the woods sometimes playing with other kids but often by myself and I don't I I mean I have memories of this I can't say that there's a specific moment but I remember making Stone circles around our house it took me weeks to make yeah uh I remember making medicine in my backyard having a plastic tub and picking plants and putting them in there and mashing them up and adding water to it and remember my mother saying what are you doing and I said I'm making medicine I didn't know even the plant that I was picking them but I know the name of the plant now it's called plantain and I would put it on like I'd get bugged by nobody taught me this the plants taught me this yeah and so fast forward I continued to spend all throughout my childhood a lot of time in the woods we moved to different places but there were always Woods nearby which were my refuge I just loved being in woods and so around the age of 11 I went to Camp one summer we didn't have much money so it was like a not a Sleepaway Camp but a day camp I was the only time my parents ever sent me to camp for a couple weeks and someone one of the instructors showed us this plan and let us taste it and it was marvelous um I was never on sweet things I liked sour things lemon lime flavor and this plant had this wonderful sour taste and I'm sure he told us what it was called but I didn't remember yeah and I spent the next two years trying to figure out what this plant was it turns out it was wood sorrel I knew it I knew like that was that was like my fur Beyond like edible berries I knew like blackberries and raspberries and things like that that grew in the woods but beyond that that was really my first edible plant and from that I got a book and it was called stalking the wild asparagus by Jewel period and after reading that book I got his other books talking the healthful herbs yeah and literally I fell in love with this idea that I could walk out into the fields into the woods anywhere and find plants that were medicinal that were edible that had economic uses and I sell head over heels in love not only with plants but the idea that they were there and they could help us and we could learn from them yeah and that for me is the start and you said you know many of us started in the in the 60s and uh the 70s and 80s for me it was the late 60s and I just it was never looked back and it's funny because when I first started doing this people would say to me well what do you do and I'd say well I'm an urban and people like I told them I was an alien from another planet and they'd say well you mean like spices and I probably should have said yes but I said no and one person said to me one time they said you mean like potpourri I said no and they were just shaking their head going poor misguided youth why would you waste your time studying something that people did a hundred years ago Nobody Does that anymore but again I had fallen in love with this and it didn't matter to me whether it was popular it didn't matter whether anybody else was interested this was my passion at this point and I feel so blessed because I've spent literally my entire teenage years through now doing what I love to do I feel so blessed that I found my vocation and advocation so early in life and the world eventually kind of caught up because people like you and so many of our other wonderful Elders you know started spreading the word to the point where now herbal medicine is much better known than it certainly was in the late 1960s I always tell people when I first started studying herbs all my friends were interested in Wonder and I was interested in all the other ones and the funny thing is that what herb is probably even more popular today oh my God talking about it yeah absolutely yeah that's that's just so heartwarming David you know I think it's a story that's very familiar to so many of our hearts too you know like so many of us felt somewhat alienated as children you know all in different ways I know in yours there was a lot of physical things that were confronting you and you had what were big challenges and yet you know you found the plants are probably more likely the plants found you you know it's such a beautiful story yeah and I have to say you said it was such a blessing for you I want to say also it was such a blessing for the world that that you said yes to the plants because you've contributed so much in these past 50 plus years so yeah so um so is there a particular teacher or teachers that most influenced your work and maybe inspired you on your path as a herbalist maybe that you particularly want to share with us about absolutely so I have been fortunate to have a number of really significant teachers some of them are plants some of them are patients but in my career I had an aunt an uncle who taught me some things which was really fortunate but I would say that the person who I think I owe the most to as an herbalist was one of the people I consider one of the three great herbalists of the 20th century and those are William La Saucier who I studied with yeah Michael Moore Oh and yourself oh really and of course you go beyond that you know uh William and and Michael has um passed but what William introduced me to the idea of because you know before him the first person I took classes from was Dr John Christopher oh yeah and I honored Dr Christopher because Dr Christopher kept herbal medicine alive at its absolute Nader at its lowest point he was there teaching classic and I took off a few classes with him and it was very much you know this herb for this kind of condition yeah and then in 1976 I stumbled into William saucier's work and fortunately later became friends with William and William is probably the least known he didn't publish widely but William or Willie is people also called him was one of the first off I believe he was one of those few people I've ever met in my life it was an out now genius I mean he was astonishing and I still to this day have no idea where he learned what he knew it it I don't know what yeah did it come out of The Ether it certainly didn't come out of books and William introduced me to the concept of energetics and one of the things I always say to my students they say how many of you want to be a good herbalist and everybody raises their hand and I go wrong answer if you're going to be an herbalist but the reality is if you're going to be an herbalist a nurse a carpenter a car mechanic a farmer don't be content to be just good or good enough do your best great now none of us achieves that in the sense that who's to measure but you try to do your best every day yeah and to constantly learn and grow and do better and every day is an opportunity to learn something new and so anyway if you want to be great in my opinion if you want to be a great herbalist there are a few skills that are really vital one is understanding herbal energetics two differential diagnosis three the concept of synergy because that allows you you know Hippocrates is believed to have said more than two thousand years ago it's more important to know the person that has a disease than the disease a person has well either he said it or some one of his students said it whoever said it they were correct and so the ideas in my opinion great herbalists treat people not diseases and so if you're you know if you just treat for instance something like depression as a single entity your results are never going to be very good but if you treat the person who is depressed understanding the underlying energetics and pathophysiology of why they are depressed your ability to help them increase this exponentially yeah so William the concept of herbal energetics the only Chinese herbs I knew before I met him were probably Asian ginseng and what everybody called dong Klay dangwi um but he introduced me to herbs like processed Romania and white peony and astragalus and goji berry and just all of these things that I had never even heard of he also created well first off he was a brilliant diagnostician and he had all sorts of fascinating ways of doing diagnosis some of which I still use today some of which like he was also into palmistry and numerology and and and that's stuff I didn't work with not that it doesn't have validity it's just not something that I personally work with but he also created this system for creating individualized formulas for people called the Triune or triangle system did a little bit of time to learn but I still teach it to my students in my two-year program and they learn it over a period of about the last five months of class and when they first start they're literally pulling their hit their hair out of their head going oh my God I'll never figure this out some students have called it herbal Sudoku uh or 3D gas but once you understand the concept In from from from thinking I'll never figure this out to three or four months later 90 plus percent of my students are doing we're very good to excellent work and by the time they're done through your program most everybody's doing excellent work and it allows design a formula for a person that is literally like a tailored suit of clothing you're looking at the whole person their energetics all the different issues going on in their body and you're being able to put it together not just by throwing a bunch of stuff together but by doing in a rational manner that is also looking at the energetics meaning there are herbs that are strengthening and nourishing herbs that are tonifying herbs that are eliminators and putting it together in this really coherent way and so luckily when William introduced me to the system what he did is he created this initial list you've probably seen his initial list very very sparse of you know what each system and what herbs do within that system so whether it's a builder neutral Eliminator well I took that and kind of ran with it and before William passed away I showed him what I had done with him really and he was absolutely thrilled he was the because not too many people continue to do it certainly there are other people in our community you know other people as well Kathy Cavill and other people who are familiar with the system yeah um but not that many people who really work with it because what he gave us was sort of the seeds of it and I only found this out from Kathy recently that she learned it from him in 1975. he actually created it that year I learned it in 1976 as a following year and I I had no idea that it literally was less probably less than a year old or about a year old when I learned it um but it again it is a brilliant system so for me William is one of those people whose shoulders I stand on but again I've had so many incredible teachers and whether it is sitting in on classes from our dear friend Michael Moore whether it is going to classes of some of the newer younger herbalists and sitting there going you know this person's like you know 32 years old and I'm sitting there going oh my God they yeah brilliant you know it took 80 32 years just to learn what they're talking about and they're already there you know uh and one of the beautiful things for me as a teacher is you're trying to help our students to surpass us not to be you know pale reflections of us but to surpass us to take what we have shared with them which our elders shared with us and take it further and make it grow bigger and more beautiful and more helpful and that's what I see happening and and I have to say Rosemary that one of the other people that has been incredible influence to me in my life is you um and I don't mean to embarrass you but you may not remember this we probably do but we met in 1981 and we met it right in Bush hot springs at the first um uh uh Brighton Bush uh herbal Retreat from the California school of verbal studies and I knew who you were you didn't know who I was at the time and I had heard about this because this was going to be the first big big herb Gathering there had been a couple smaller ones in California that I was unaware of but this was going to be the first like big thing and there were no other herb conferences and today there's herb conferences all over the United States and all over the world but then there were none and here I am I'm on the east coast and for a very long time I thought I was not correct about this but I thought I was the only herbalist on the East Coast I really did for a very long time and of course what I later found out was there were lots of herbalists on the East Coast but they were mostly traditional herbalists in rural communities serving their rural communities and they weren't really that well known outside of the community so you had people like catfish gray in West Virginia and you had Tommy bass in Alabama and you're at Dell Dawson our dear friend in Vermont you had Evelyn snook in Pennsylvania so these people existed but they were going locally with the exception of Tommy bass who had a bit more of a reputation they you know they didn't have an international uh following or even a national following they just were known in their local communities so when I heard about this herb conference I was like I'm going and if I'm not mistaken that was probably only the second or third time I'd ever been on a plane and I fly out I flew out to to Oregon and our late dear friend Cascade Anderson Geller uh picked me up and I stayed with her and we had a whole lot of fun when picking a hypericum and just wonderful time and we went to Brighton Bush and I remember there are 70 of us sitting in the big room all right and we're sitting in a semi we're sitting on the floor cross-legged and there's 70 Us in this long op long Circle and I'm sitting there looking around going um and it was just the most awesome experience because I was so felt so isolated on the East Coast with nobody to share my passion with and it was just it was just brilliant and that is because of you and one of the things I will say about you that is absolutely true you know it's not that hard to be a visionary what's really hard is to be a Visionary who makes their dreams come true and you have done that repeatedly and I honestly consider you sort of like the Fairy Godmother of the American herbal Renaissance and so in 1981 I'd already was teaching here in the east coast but in 1981 I show up at Brighton bush and you didn't know me again I knew who you were and um one of the teachers Nam Singh Chinese herbalist and and Taoist you didn't show up and so I come up to you and again you didn't know who I was I said excuse me Rosemary um I know Chinese herbs and that's what the class system is about I could fill in if you like and you said sure so that was that was like my first teaching gig sort of outside of my local area and the next year you invited me to come back and teach and so I thank you and I honor you I you know it's like when you send me the email when I do this I was like yes yes uh because you gave me that opportunity yeah and you get it and you everything you do was such hard with such ways with such beauty and I just love that and I love you so thank you it's so fun to hear those stories he took me right back to that early Brighton Bush and I actually clearly remember you coming up you know the part that I don't remember is you're asking to teach a class on Chinese medicine but what I do remember is that enthusiasm and that passion that I saw radiating off of you so there was no way I wasn't going to say yes right yeah I could I recognize if here's another plant-loving herbalist right and definitely breed them into the fold so thank you for saying yes to that but um listen do you have I know you must have many of them but can you just like off the top of your head think of maybe a favorite herbal story that you'd like to share with the listeners just about the plants or it's kind of a broad question but no no no I I absolutely do it's actually two two connected stories so my uncle who lived in North Carolina and I got to spend some Summers with him when I was uh my late teens and I had an aunt that lived there as well and they were traditional herbalists um in in their own way I wasn't their primary thing but anyway my uncle had always told me that if I didn't know what herb to use for somebody I should walk through the woods in the fields thinking about the person that needed that herb and Lance would tell me that they could help by shaking and I was more of an herbalist than my uncle was and I always thought well that's interesting but I never did it I never used it I always thought I knew what was you know a writer for somebody even when I was totally wrong at least you know I thought I had some clue and sometimes I didn't sometimes I couldn't really do not so one day many years later probably a decade or two later um and her friends in Churchville Virginia and I'm going to be teaching that weekend for them and they they had a Old Farm House very very simple and they didn't have indoor plumbing in outhouse so it's in the morning and I get up and I'm just wearing my t-shirt and a pair of underwear and and I walk outside to go to the outhouse and there's a big sign when it says out of order and I'm like whoa look yeah it is bad and I'm looking around and I really have to go and I'm looking for a place to walk into the woods and there's poison ivy everywhere now there are worse places to get poison ivy than on the soles of your feet and between your toes but not many and I'm and I'm sensitive poison ivy so I'm kind of like topping foot to foot going I don't know what to do and also around the corn mice I I see this bush shaking and I look at it and I think is there a bird in there is there a squirrel or rabbit whatever I walk over expecting something to Scurry away or fly away and there's nothing and it's shaking and I realize there's no wind I also looked down and realized the only place there's no poison ivy so go in take care of what I need to do and from that moment I have believed if you have a need so again several another decade or so later I'm at my old Farm in Northwestern New Jersey and I was out by the barn and it was a typical August New Jersey summer day hot humidity about 122 percent not that there is such a thing and I'm sitting in the barn in the shade there's not a breeze to be had you wish there was you know it was just still and humid and I'm thinking about this patient of mine who I've been working with for a little over a year and she came to me she was in her early 60s and she had glomerular nephritis which is a chronic degenerative kidney disease and uh I had she had been to you know all sorts of nephrologists and she'd been in different people and I'd put her on a Chinese formula called Romania 6. in this formula you can kind of Plateau people who have kidney disease and kind of keep them from getting worse but it will work for about a year maybe a year and a half if you're lucky two years and then it stops working and she had been at about 18 kidney function for for a year a year and two or three months and all of a sudden her her egfr goes from 18 to 16 and at that point I knew time was up you know it wasn't going to work anymore and I'm trying to figure out what to do I couldn't I couldn't think of anybody to refer her to I I and you know as a clinician you want to help the people that you're working with us all right it's our job but also you know you feel terrible for somebody who's suffering and you want to help them I'm thinking about her and thinking what can we do you know and all of a sudden I look up and I see I have this big nettle patch and the Nettles are shaking so what did I think I think is there a bird in there is there a squirrel is there a rabbit is there a wreck you know back to the 50 gets some kind of an animal so again I will stand up I walk over expecting a bird to fly out or a rabbit to run away nothing and the plants are shaking and again there's not a breeze anywhere and in my head I hear oh God I can't help her and I'm like and I'm looking at the nettle plant looking at the leaves and this is August is not to get time to gather nettle leaves you know the leaves are looking you know they're they're starting to Yellow they don't look good at all and I think to myself never leave his great medicine I love never leaves but it's not going to help plumerial or nephritis and then I hear again a seeds pods kind of not they don't really rustle they don't make much of a noise but they kind of and I hear not my leaves not my seeds at this point my jaws probably hit the ground and I'm like you know like okay and I'd never heard of using nettle seed for anything yeah never he hadn't had some place that in Europe it was used like when people and there was famine people would use it as an emergency food so I knew it wasn't it was potentially edible it wasn't gonna be harmful so I went back almost like ups and tobacco I came back offered the tobacco as a ritual gift to the plant wearing gloves harvested a whole bunch of the seed made a tincture out of it in a couple weeks it's ready I call up my patient and I said listen I've got this thing it's very experimental but if you'd like to try it I'll give it to you and she said look you've helped me more than anybody else's helped me I trust you I'll try it so I gave her some of the nettle seed tincture and in about six or eight weeks she's back to 18 kidney function the next test which is about three months later she's up to 20 kidney function it's amazing a year and a half two years later she is at 28 in kidney function her this is a quote she told me her doctor said to her he says what are you doing and she says well I'm taking these there she says I don't want to know just keep doing it these herbs kept her between 286 and 28 kidney function for like 16 or 18 years they just passed away but she didn't pass away from degenerative kidney disease all right and so that is how I learned about you know because we talked about great teachers before that's how I learned about the use of nettle c um and it wasn't you know I I don't use the word I discovered it I didn't discover I just listen and the plant told me what it could do and the amazing thing is that was the first case the second case came along about 80 six months later I treated in somebody and by the time I had 10 cases or eight out of ten had responded I now know that for instance Neville C does not work for um polycystic kidney disease and it can be useful for things like diabetic nephropathy but you have to really get the diabetes under control if you wanted to be a benefit um but it's remarkable and it works not only in humans it works on dogs it works on cats I cannot tell you how many stories I have heard of people saying they had a dog or a cat who was dying from kidney failure um they'd stop eating stop drinking and people started just you know taking it dripping it in their mouth and they recover and listen yeah and I I have many many many many case histories of using this plant at this point and it's just it's a remarkable medicine and so you know some of the best things I've ever learned about plants yeah that's such a great point you know what it's always interesting to me too about how you know people think that we study and learn this information we definitely do study and learn a lot from one another there's no doubt about it you know and how we trade and you know Inspire one another to learn but really when we learn to listen to the plants it's Medicine of the Earth right and the plants can teach us and they have been for centuries you know that's one of the things I always like to point out is that we have these various Traditions yes but really the tradition that we most study at is the tradition of the earth it's the Earth's medicine meant for all humankind to use and herbal is just you know we're really good at dispensing dispersing that information but it's coming from the earth it belongs to all of us right it's not really for one group or nationality of people it's all you know kind of a I think a huge translation of how we listen to the Earth and how it speaks to us but that that's a beautiful story David on so many levels thank you for sharing you know it brings me up you I mean you what you've just shared is definitely a powerful example of how the plants heal but I was just wondering do you have another story like one of those miracle healing stories that you've seen the plants do I always I always feel it's like witnessing for the plants you know I love hearing those stories so if you have a favorite plant you know kind of just one of those healing stories another one to share with you I share with us I'd love to hear it I'm sure our listeners would as well well I have a formula that I call grief relief and this is a formula and you know as you mentioned earlier I have an herb company and you know most of the formulas are formulas I designed I didn't Design This formula the plants told me this formula and the formula is very simple most of my formulas are more complex than this this only has three ingredients and it is mimosabar which is uh Collective happiness peel it's a Chinese herb but Mimosa the albizia Joel percent has become an introduced plant and that's one of the cool things you know people you were talking about you know the Traditions belong to everyone well so many of the plants that are common here in the U.S are not native to here they've been introduced and so with them we learn about new medicines from other places whether we go back to that tradition or are we gain it from the plants and so Mimosa bark is the single greatest mood elevator that I've ever come across in my life and it's illegal um you know you give somebody Mimosa bark and they walk around they're like just the big smile on their face and you'll go up to him and say why are you so Hackley anyway I have no idea my face hurts or smiley now I will say do not give Mimosa bark to people who are bipolar it can precipitate a manic episode and I've seen it several times for people who we didn't know were bipolar but we found out so um but it's this phenomenal mood elevator and to that is added fragrant rose petals it has to be fragrant rose petals so if you have roses and they don't have an odor then you can't use them but if you have cabbage roses damask roses Apothecary roses Beach roses which smell wonderful you ever see those with the giant giant rose hips there's a Leslie anyway I'm not using the Rockets we're using the fragrant rose petals and then we dry them and then the last ingredient is Hawthorne berries and flowers they're combined and so grief relief I use for people who have chronic Grease sadness broken hearts and anybody who tells you a broken heart is not a real thing you look it and I've seen this multiple times in my practice you have a couple who've been together for many years and you know decades and decades and one of them passes away and the other one's in really good health for their age and within six months a year they pass away or another example is another of our great herbal Elders Bill Mitchell who his son died and he passed away within yeah within hours no and he died of a broken heart and what I can say about that specific case but what I can say is that broken hearts can be treated if you have time and so I use it for broken hearts I use it for what today would be called PTSD now remember with PTSD this formula is going to allow things to come up so you need to make sure that the person you're giving it to is in therapy with a good therapist somebody they really trust but it will allow things to come up it helps to prevent reinstatement of fear memories it's just an amazing thing and I also use it for what I call stagnant depression and stagnant depression kind of overlaps with PTSD but it's my own definition so if you look in the DSM-5 you won't find stagnant depression I coined the term and but what stagnant depression is is situational depression so something bad happens and we're not here to judge you know what's bad for one person maybe not a big deal for somebody else but something for you for that person is traumatic happens and they get stuck there and that vent becomes the Sun and you are now orbiting that trauma and you don't have the strength to escape the gravitational pull of that trauma and so I use it for stagnant depression and it is an amazing feeling to be working with somebody who has been stuck in their depression in their sadness in their grief for years I'm not talking about giving this to somebody who's going through a normal grieving process reef is a normal therapist therapeutic and emotional spiritual process that we shouldn't avoid too many people just I don't want to feel that but my experience is and I I I say I'm right but my belief is that in life there are two main times when we grow when we're in love and when we're in pain and so it is an opportunity for growth even though it's not a pleasant one and none of us look for it it is an opportunity so it's not like we're using it for somebody who's in a normal grieving process but this is for somebody who's stuck they're ready to move on and they're still stuck there and to have somebody who's been stuck literally in place for five years 10 years 20 years and you give them this and all of a sudden out of the blue you know after a few months they call you up and go you know what you're like no I'm thinking of taking a yoga class again yes you know and you can see that that you know that that pain suffering that grief starting to break away and open up and them coming back into life which is normally what happens with with um situational depression but for some people they just get stuck there and so that's what I call stagnant depression and I that's where I use that formula and it's just brilliant and I thank the plants every day thank you David because I'm know when I was going through the deepest heartbreak of my entire life unfancable tragedy that happened to my family you sent me bottles of the grief relief and it was it definitely was so helpful that in flower essence is in the love of friends is what pulled me back from you know really the brink of Despair so really thank you it's a beautiful beautiful formula yeah and I love again how you relate it back to the plants the plants are the ones who showed up and told you to you know to use them to put them together beautiful well yeah so you know it's always fun to ask what your favorite plant allies are those plan I'm sure you have several and you know just the ones that show up for you and have and yeah what are they that's a hard question we've already talked about nettle seed we've talked about the Mimosa the Hawthorne the rose I love roses I just I I I'm head over heels in love with roses there are so many I mean you know whether it's the humble plantain which is probably the first medicinal plant I ever knew even if I didn't understand what it was at the time but I'm by the way I'm talking about the broadleaf plantain although the landslip I'm sure worked perfectly well in the same ways but you know whether it is plantain I I I will say I have a real acidity for weeds and the the ones I love the best are the weedy plants that are rather ubiquitous so we could talk about a Burdock or a dandelion or a Nettles and not only are they everywhere but different parts of the plants do different things so literally you can get three medicines from one plant so you'll have something like Burdock where the root is used the seed is used and the leaf is used and they all do different things plus the central stalk and the roots or young roots are edible or you have nettle which you have the leaf the root and the seed all of which do different things plus of course the young leaves are edible or you have you know so so plants like that for me are just such they give us so much and yet and it culturally and I'm talking about sort of dominant culture the common culture looks at these and they're weeds and we need to use herbicides and get rid of them and here are these plants that are so giving and so amazing and are just there for us to use in all sorts of ways to help not only nourish our bodies but to alleviate our illnesses to prevent disease so I I just have a a very special place in my heart for these sort of witty adventurous plants dandelion you know again the dandelion Leaf has one activity dandelion root another dandelion flower another the crowns are edible The Roots you can use to make quote unquote dandelion quality I mean there's again just so many uses of these things and as a culture they're just so unappreciated so those to me those to me are really special plans and then you mentioned earlier about adaptogens of course you know I I wrote a book on adaptogens and and they are a grouping of plants that number one well one of the reasons I wrote the book is because they're not well understood and a lot of people have this idea that adaptogens are good for stress yeah but so are nervings and so are you know anxiolytics and there's lots of plants that are useful for stress and we don't have time to get into what is the actual definition of an adaptogen but it's more complex than the original definition proposed in 1969 which is more than you know 50 years old that original definition was very simplistic and numerous plants fit that mold but the current definition again is we have a better understanding of what they do and how they work but the fact that there are plants that can help us to deal with stressors and create what's called a non-specific state of resistance to stress meaning it doesn't matter whether it's environmental stress temperature stress noise stress psychological stress it helps us to respond more appropriately more effectively uh to those things and helps reduce a lot of the adverse effects of stress and so you know most of our adaptogens most of our adaptogens either come from India or China and that is not because the only plants that are adaptogens grow in India and China it's because those two cultures have ancient medical Traditions aggravated and traditional Chinese medicine that have been using plants in a very not in just in a sort of um heroic kind of politum purgum and pukem's kind of tradition but have looked at plants as gentle harmonizing remedies for thousands of years so they explore their material Medica looking for plants like this in the west we don't have those ancient Traditions as much I mean there are native Traditions but they're not as widely known so here we have these these ancient Traditions so that's why one of the reasons why a lot of those plants come from there but that doesn't mean there aren't North American adaptogenic plants or potentially South American adoption they're probably adaptogenic plants in every environment they're not probably a whole lot of stuff though uh at least not that myth since the current definition but the idea that there are plants that can help us this way so for instance um I will mention just a couple of them very briefly and the reason I mention these is because they're easy to grow meaning no matter where you are you can grow these plants so like for instance one of our our native adaptogenic plants is American ginseng but in American ginseng is not so easy to grow it can be grown for a lot of doubt it's a very you know long growing plant it can be grown but it's not so easy but there are plants and they're not native to North America but they certainly can be grown you have one plant which is ubiquitous in India which is holy basil and holy if you can grow Garden basil you can grow holy basil now be aware that Martin basil doesn't do what holy basil does there's also a plant being sold as as temperate Tulsi or uh some people a lot of people think it's holy basil it's not it's African basil it doesn't have the same activity but the holy basil from India which is a sacred plant um is an amazing plant it is a carminative so it's for Digestive upset it uh lowers blood sugar levels it has anxiolytic and antidepressant activity it is an adaptogen it helps to reduce the negative effects of stress I mean and again if you can grow basil you can grow you can grow holy basil so it's plants like that that literally you can live in an apartment and you could grow it in a pot on your balcony you don't need you know acreage you don't need a big Garden you could grow it as a house plant another one this one I wouldn't grow as a house plant is a Chinese herb called the herb of immortality and it's native to the border right between Southern China and Vietnam and it's well known in that area but it was not well known outside of that area and this herb is in the Cucumber family and it is very easy to grow I have some growing here and in fact if you're a place like North Carolina it stays green all year round here it flies back in the in the winter and comes back in in the spring and it grows pretty profusely it could actually probably become weedy and there are two varieties there's one that's predominantly sweet the bitter aftertaste and there's one that's predominantly bitter with the sweet aftertaste I suspect the latter is probably more medicinal but this became introduced into the West because Japanese companies were looking for non-caloric sweeteners which it contains that's where that sweet principle is and um this herb again is a bio uh adaptogen that's great as a tea herb and it is really easy to grow um one last two two other ones I'll just mention really briefly ashwagandha didn't grow potatoes excuse me you can grow tomatoes or Peppers you can grow ashwagandha and in one year you get a beautiful root um it probably you know it's a it's a semi-tropical plant so it's not going to survive really cold Winters it'll you know get killed although I remember seeing one at smile herb shop in Maryland that was several years old that just kept you know it would die back to the root and come back in in the spring so if your Winters aren't too cold um it might survive easy to grow and the root is the part used in ashwagandha is a calming adaptogen so for people who are anxious nervous insomnia it's lovely it stimulates thyroid function for people who have hypothyroidism it acts as an immune amphoteric helping to re-regulate the immune system whether it's hypo hyper or active or both um again lovely lovely herb is used traditionally for to enhance libido in men enhance fertility in women and lastly one other adaptogen and then we'll get off that topic and schizandra is actually pretty easy to grow and um and you get these there's a farm of at least 10 acres of schizandro Massachusetts that's just the most amazing oh oh yeah and the the schizandra berries or another calming adaptogen also a pedal protective activity it's an immune infoteric and these are herbs that are just so beneficial in so many ways and I I don't I mean I could spend I could spend or more talk about each one of these but the fact is that there are many of these things and I absolutely believe there are more to be discovered and I will finish off by saying one last thing generally speaking in traditional cultures adaptogen or adaptogenic herbs are not used as symbols meaning a single herb they're used in combination with other things and one of the classic groups of herbs that adaptogens are used with are nervings also some people call them nerve lines and to me the queen of nervees is fresh out and I used fresh oat either as a fresh Oak tincture fresh oaklycerate and I use it it is lovely it is the fresh milky oat so one week out of the oats life cycle there's this milk stage you have to harvest it right then prepare it right then and it is basically I use it for people who are burning the candle at the top the bottom the middle of the back inside and out left and right these people are smooth fried they are crispy they have lost their emotional Foundation they're having number 10 reactions to number one problems and over time it's a slow acting remedy but over time especially with some of your calming adaptages like a schizandra or ashwagandha if it's right for that person it could help to restore that emotional Foundation I love fresh oat and who today after three years of a pandemic and all the other stuff that has been going on couldn't use a little rest instead of their emotions actually many of the herbs that you've mentioned in this very short interview are all really perfect herbs for people to be using now I was really thinking about that like with the grief relief and the adaptogens and those restorative herbs you know they're really a great herb I don't know if you were doing it consciously and intentionally but they're such a great group of herbs to be presenting right now in time in history so that was brilliant yeah I think I you know I was playing around what I was listening to you I was I kept wanting to go I need to ask them this really challenging question you just pick one herb that's your favorite herb but you know I'm not going to do that to you because I know it's like asking somebody to pick their favorite child or something it's it's almost cruel to ask us that so I won't do that but we're sort of we only have a few more minutes and I did have a couple other questions I just wanted to ask you you know what is um you know where herbalism as you were mentioning earlier is just changed so dramatically since we started with you know so many incredibly beautiful young herbalists and Herb books and courses and classes and Gatherings so it's really exciting to see that but what do you see personally as maybe some of the challenges they're very different that was facing us when we were starting like things like even just finding classes finding books finding Gatherings finding information finding good quality herbs you know any all of that was the stuff that we had to focus on to bring forth but today herbalists have a whole new set of challenges and I'm just wondering what your perspective might be like what you see as some of the challenges as herbalism moves forward well obviously I'm looking at it sort of from a kind of a long-range perspective and somebody who is a young herbalist today may have very ideas and very different ideas than I do so I don't I don't want to speak for anyone uh but I can again in my opinion why I'd say there's a couple of things that are worth looking at number one over the intervening for me it's now been I think 54 years since I started studying herbal medicine time flies and you're having fun so in that time frame what has happened is certain herbs have become popular but to a great degree herbal medicine has none so what I mean by that is you hear about these sound bites of information so St John's word is the depression or black cohosh is the menopause herb saw palmetto is the prostator the only problem with each one of those things I just said is they are wrong wrong and wrong so yes to St John's word help with depression yeah but of the more than 14 types of depression that I look at it's really really useful for three of them and so what the studies show us is St John's Wort is as good as Prozac and Zoloft and things like that but they only work 40 percent of the time so again it goes back treating the person not the disease and so we need to get away from these little sound bites of information and I cannot tell you how many women who I've seen over the years who tell me I tried herbs they don't work what are they talking about they tried um black cohosh and it had only marginal effects for their menopausal symptomology and that's right but if you took that black cohosh and you mixed it with Chase tree and mother wore and a little bit of Licorice and Sage then you're talking about something very different that's going to have a major effect on a broad number of women so the idea is is taking herbs out of the realm of this is good for this and getting into that deeper level of understanding how to actually treat people that I think is still not well known so yes I don't get the phone calls anymore what's that herb education but most people are still looking at it from a Western Medical model and while what uh you're in a good physician does overlap for the most part they're very different paradigms and I'll leave them to treat disease I'll treat people so that that I think is one thing um in addition to that there are some really super very big issues and this goes to for instance like the work that United plan Savers does which you as a Visionary create help create I remember that initial meeting we had at um Center when we talked about trading the United plant Savers and that is that many of our native species have become it's threatened or endangered and what we need to start looking at is real sustainability so I'm not concerned about somebody while crafting Kudzu in the southeast United States that would be a good thing or dandelion or chickweed or Burdock but I am concerned about people while crafting things like Trillium best route which cannot withstand uh harvesting or monotropy uniflora uh Indian pipe ghost pipe that again cannot cultivate it so I think that we need to look at creating sustainable organically cultivated herbs so that we can continue to grow this and continue to expand this so more and more people can access this we don't want this to be something that's just available to a small number of people we want this available to everyone but then we can't be depending for the most part on our native herbs we have to start looking at cultivation and in my mind that means organic cultivation in the right dedial which means the right soil the right environment you don't try to grow um oh I don't know uh don't try to grow you know shop around in Vermont yeah so exactly so I think I think it really uh creating sustainability in what we do and then lastly um I I would say that one other thing is affordability and because herbalists need to be able to make a right livelihood so it's not you know about being a poverty Consciousness that I can't charge for what I do if that's the way you work but I think that finding ways to make this available to people because a lot of people have medical insurance but it doesn't cover herbs and so how can we make these things is available and affordable to people while also allowing young herbalists especially actually make a living to be able to actually live a good life and not have to sit there and and worry about counting their pennies every month just to pay rent in order to be an herbalist it could you know it's a service profession and my uncle used to say by serving you'll be served that's true but we live in a culture that doesn't understand reciprocity and so we need to find ways to make this uh approachable as a profession but also make it approachable so that nobody is turned away and one of my favorite things to do with my patients some people call them clients but for patients is to teach them about what's wrong in their backyard what is available to them what they can grow in their Garden so that they can make some of their own medicines well David that's those are just such incredible just it's just there are also things summed them up and put them and put them in such a beautiful context yeah we're sort of coming to the end of our time and I I just wanted to say you know you have done so much and had so much influence in the herbal World in this country and I I could list a whole long list of things that you've accomplished but I'm just curious to hear of all the things that you've done is there any one particular thing that you're most proud of is that you just you know can look back and say I did done this and feel so good about it either at a big scale or a personal scale it doesn't really matter um I would just say two things number one I feel very honored and humble to be a part of what I would call the American herbal Renaissance you know kind of from the beginning of herbal medicine you know regaining its rightful place and you know I I don't want to go on beyond my time limit but I would say is that I did a keynote speech at the Florida herbal conference some years ago a wonderful conference put on by our dear friend Emily Ruff and um I called my my talk I have a dream and I started off by saying you've heard these words before by somebody far more eloquent than I but I actually have a dream too and my dream is this coming from a time when herbal medicine was virtually extinct I would like to see hopefully within my lifetime a time where almost every Mom Dad Grandma Grandpa knows basic kitchen herbal medicine for their families where there are community herbalists in every community and clinical herbalists available in every in any clinical setting because I actually believe that herbal medicine is a part not you know the answer but it's a part of helping to create a sustainable practice in medicine this country because we all know that the uh American system in medicine is terribly broken and unsustainable and unaffordable so I I honestly believe that and then lastly I would say my students I am so humbled and appreciative of my students who have taken what I have shared and taken it and created their own schools written books helped tens of thousands of people to live better healthier happier lives and most of these people I I may never meet I don't know but just to know that that has passed on and people have taken it and grown it and will continue to do so into this it's like I just want to stand up and give you a standing ovation David really you're just so inspiring you know even in this just short our talk with you I've learned so much you know like really actually I've learned a lot like with the nettle seats for instance I've sort of like you know I know about him I've read about him and you know Ryan drum uses those a lot for us uh stimulants and I never really found them worked as this very stimulating agent so I usually say well people use the nettle seeds but I haven't really found them effective you know but really honestly after hearing your story I have a whole different reverence for them and I do know people who have some kidney issues I'm going to try them on them so yeah just so many things but I just want to say in wrapping up is that one of the things I've always found so inspiring about you is how brilliant you are you know like just how you're able to read and discern and you know digest information and then let that information flow out so eloquently but also what I love about you is that you are so Earth orientated you know I'll just never forget in my life all those times that you would just say prayers at those Gatherings you know just how you just would voice to the spirit you know to bless the Gatherings and Bless the people and how you'd have us doing ceremony and just those kind of Earth things like when you said you know you you've learned to really listen to the plan so you bridge that world of the intellect and the Earth and you do it in a really beautiful way and then bring that forth as a gift for all of us I really want to thank you for that and just tell you how much I love you and I'm so glad to be your friend and you know look forward to the many to the long journey ahead as I said to the journey to the heart of the green Nations we're all on there a little slower than we used to be but still laughing and loving life and thank you so much for joining and I want to thank all of our listeners too for joining in with us and if you want to get in touch with David we'll have his we'll have his uh website and information on our website but you can also go to usherbalstudies.net and connect with David directly so thank you sweetie so much I love talking to you and have a wonderful day thank you Rosemary it's been a pleasure I love you too I am thankful to
