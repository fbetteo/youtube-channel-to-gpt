[Music] well I want to thank you all for joining me I'm really excited about this class today and it's also an introduction for the newest edition of my book herbs for Children's Health which I really have put a lot of time and energy into because it's such an incredibly important subject um this is actually the fourth edition of this book the first one came out in 1991 it was a little self-published uh pamphlet that I did myself and actually this should be in inspiration for all of you aspiring writers that when I first started writing I just wrote simple little pamphlets I actually did all the design and artwork myself and I sold them myself and then story book a wonderful publication asked me to expand on the topic and to do a second edition which came out in 1999 so this was a second edition the Third Edition came out in 2015 and because the topic has been so popular people are concerned about their children they're concerned about giving pharmaceutical there's a lot more Consciousness about wanting to raise our children more naturally there's a lot of Consciousness about nature deficiency in children not getting kids outside so the topic is actually becoming more popular rather than less and so I was asked to expand on the blow and I had really a good time putting wh together but I it's not really so much the book I want to talk about it's just the the topic itself of herbs for children's I want to start off maybe talking about safety that comes up as a really big concern for all parents of course we're really concerned about our children their health and we're very concerned about using things that are safe so how safe our herbs do the safe test medicine that we have available they're the ones that have been the most time tested over thousands of years not hundreds of years and by millions of people around the world because herbalism is our oldest system of healing that we know of and that we have and I always like to point out that this really one of the things that we share as Humanity it's one of those things that's commonality in all Races and nationalities and cultures around the world so herbs are safe for children and of course the herbs that we use for children is a specific concern because there are really really strong herbs that aren't necessarily needed but there is a whole group of herbs that have been used for children's health for a long period of time and we also want to take into consideration our death many times when seeking doctor's help professional uh practitioners help and also using Pharmaceuticals might be important and when might that be I would say well whenever possible use herbs for home health care for all of the everyday illnesses that and OES and scratches and infections that that we get and especially that children get that uh people have been using these home remedies again as I mentioned are centuries for there's a lot of reasons why we would choose her over Pharmaceuticals or even over the counter medication you know one again is the safety we know they're safe generally with this group of herbs that will be sharing and talking about and that I've really emphasized in my book these herbs really do not have side effects other than the side effect of being healthier but there's also other considerations like the ecological concern herbalism is a very ecologically sane type of medicine to use we're not spoiling the environment we're not dumping chemicals that are impacting animals and fish and Birds um and it's also economical you know especially if you grow these plants or collect them yourself which almost every plant not all but almost every one of these plants that we're looking at and that I that I talk about in this book and that we that we emphasize for children are all herbs that are common weeds and plants that we plant in our garden so these aren't the really expensive herbs these aren't the herbs that are have really strong pharmaceutical action in the body or physiological action these are our safe everyday herbs that are also impactful and effective I always like to point out that gentle does not mean less powerful it's just a different way of being strong I love what Michael cast Castleton he's a really good writer and he wrote in one of his books uh he said why use a bulldozer what a broom will do we don't need more powerful medicine we need smarter medicine and I couldn't agree more and herbs are smart medicine for all of us who work deeply and dearly with the plants and have long relationships with them we know plants have a Consciousness it's different than our Consciousness but they are living powerful beings who think smarter often times I think than we do as people so herbs are safe and they can be used for all of the everyday illnesses and imbalances and just health-giving properties that we look for when we're caring for our children but there are times to use Pharmaceuticals absolutely and to seek the health with practitioner and I do emphasize that a lot in this book you know I want to have Clarity with that you know with any life-threatening situation and even chronic situations which actually respond better to herbalism it's often good when you work with long-term chronic issues like asthma and allergies for children that you seek the health of a professional who's knowledgeable about plants such as the natural paath and herbalist and and medical doctors who have had some training in herbalism and dosaging that's another thing that people always ask about like how much do I give my child of course we have a huge range from infants to teenage kids right little tiny fril children or big healthy hearty children so dosaging children is as arbitrary as dosaging adults you really have to have a sense of your child's strength a sense of their weaknesses their sensitivities how robust they are uh and even a little bit about the illness and all that can sound quite complicated it truly isn't because remember that we're working with herbs that do not have harmful side effects if you give a little too much if anything it might work faster and work better so dosy with this group of herbs is not critical like we would say it's absolutely critical if you're using Pharmaceuticals and over the- counter medication that you follow the dosage exactly that's given to you on the bottle though I might say that's also arbitrary because they don't really know your child at all they may know that it's St but they won't know if he's a big hot strong healthy too or if he's a very sensitive child so we have to be thinking about these things right but one of the nice things is that we do have charts that will help people especially beginners determine approximate dosages and I've included those charts in this book actually I've given you two or three different charts and then also just some guidelines for how to determine them but there are two basic rules that are usually given when you're trying to First estimate how much is enough and one's called Young's Rule I think it was probably developed by a naturopathic doctor where you you take the age of your child and you times it times 12 and then you divide it by the age of your child I don't know who figured out that math but anyway that gives you a dosage that is an approximate a dosage and it actually works out and the other is callen's rulle so both of those guidelines can really help you when you're first working with plants developing a level of safety but one of the things I do want to share with you is that I find often times that we're not giving enough rather than too much and here again I'm talking about a large class of really safe herbs the only disadvantage the only side effect again might be that the child gets well quicker or they're healthier from using these plants they're not going to have physiological challenges using plants like Danny L and C maon the rose petals and halor and this very large group of herbs that I discuss in quite detail in this book so maybe I'll talk about that next so what herbs are appropriate for children this is a very Brazen statement to to make and not all herbalists would definitely agree with me on this and in fact I might say that that's one of the things I love about herbalism and herbalists we're all quite opinionated that's we all have different ideas and thoughts most of those who have had a long time experience working with plants will develop ways that we work with herbs that are that really work for us so I really find that you can basically give any herb that you would give to an adult to a child they children are humans and they're small you just adust adjust the dosage and the form um the form that you're giving the herbs to and with that I also want to say there's some herbs that I would never use for children because they're not necessary but you know I don't really feel that there's a group of herbs that you wouldn't use for a child I think what I would rather say that there are a group of herbs that you would use for children most frequently but if a child had a really really bad infection and my elat pain wasn't working for them then I might turn to golden seal and maybe even a little bit of oan for that child in small dosages I hope I'm making sense to you I don't want to lead you astray but I also don't want to uh I I want you to really see this whole picture so the most important thing here I would say is to learn to approximate a good dosage for your child maybe Begin by using those charts and then really look at your child watch how the herbs work and most appropriately start with this large group of herbs that have huge safety net you don't have to worry about side effects and with that I should say that there are individual osyc reactions that do happen for all kinds of things like there are some people people who are allergic to cats that doesn't make cats toxic some children get allergies to dogs that doesn't make dogs dangerous to the world some children will have a go into terrible shock and be have have to be hospitalized for eating a strawberry but when you walk into a grocery store you don't see a huge signs that worn against strawberries so occasionally a child will have mild reactions to some of these wors a good example is chamomile which is considered one of the safe deserves for children but camill belongs to a large family called the composits and um and there are occasionally people who have allergies they're mild you get a little itchy scratch in the back of your throat itchy eyes so if that happens to your child then of course you would not use camomile doesn't matter how many books tell you it's good you just have to pay attention to those things just to remember that uh there are there could always be individual reactions and now that makes me also want to share that if you are working with a child or you have a child who's extremely sensitive they were born coming into this world with lots of sensitivities to the environment to floods um and they they show early allergies and that that's a sign that that child has a lot of sensitivities not only physically but oftentimes emotionally and so with those children I'm always a little more tender when I'm just giving herbs I might start with really mild herbs I might start with smaller amounts because they have more of a chance of being sensitive to herbs and a more robust child I think that just makes sense we would treat adults the same way so let me share with you some of my favorite herbs for children I would definitely say chamomile even after what I just shared like 99% of the children who use chamomile It's a Wonderful mild calming herb for children it's often times the children that herbal parents introduce their child to when maybe giving it its first bath camomile it's traditionally added to the bath water it's a way of bringing welcoming the child to a flowery World strengthen in them it's soothing it's relaxing it has a wonderful odor it's also one of the first herbs that we use internally for even infants because a lot of times children will get gassy stomachs or colic and chamomile is very very soothing of course with very small children and infants it would just be a couple drops you a little drop or full we're not talking about bottles or bottles full and often times you read and I've even written it that it was infants the mother can drink the herbal tea and that's somewhat effective but it's not nearly as effective as giving a little dropper full of the herb right into the child's mouth so just a wonderful herb I always like to point out that great story Peter Rabbit disobeyed his mother went to Farmer John's Garden Farmer John was chasing around with a pitchfork threatening his life little Peter Rabbit left his brand new jacket ran home to his mother and his mother gave him a cup of Cam and wheel tea then she spanked him and put him to bed so anyway it's a really great story and it sort of emphasizes the power that k has it's extremely relaxing I also want to talk about immune supporters these would be medicinal herbs that are really safe to give to Children Elderberry this could also be used as a tonic it's very famous now and I I have a feeling that most of you were listening to this have taken Elderberry syrup or you know drank elderberry tea it's an incredible uh immune supporter it's a broad spectrum immune support so uh it actually fights all different kinds of viruses and uh and that bacterial infections it tastes good tastes mildly good but when you add a lot of Honey rice syrup or make syrup it tastes really really good and then of course eonia so eonia is a really good example of an herb that we often times think of supporting the immune systems of adults it's absolutely perfect for children it has really no side effects and these two herbs together can really help to fight infections of all kinds in our even our youngest children and then there's lemong ball which is a beautiful herb that you can grow actually all of the herbs we've talked about so far you can grow easily in your garden your backyard but lemon bomb is especially nice for children it's very pleasant especially when it's growing fresh and you can go out with your little toddlers young children and pick those leaves and uh make a nice fresh tea with them so right away You're introducing them to the world of plants the world of of healing the world of being healthy but it's also it's calming but energizing relaxing but increases vitality and lean Bon there's been quite a bit of studies done on it uh some very very good research that shows that it's especially good for children who have a lot of energy what we might call hyperactive children just full of Life full of Vitality but as parents sometime you do meat that the relax and calm down so this is a really good alternative to some of the stronger things that are used it's really excellent and then I wanted to mention catnip too catnip is kind of fall out of favor but this used to be one of the favorite herbs of The Eclectic herbalist eclectic doctors for children when they had like pain fever had teething uh problems uh really fussy children in fact I always love the saying of Dr Claus who was the author of The what used to be considered the herbal ble of Back to Eden and we said that if every parent had well he actually said if every mother had catnb on their shelf that would save that child much suffering and every parent many a sleepless night I always love that he include the parents because when your child's fussy sore crying the child's really suffering and so are you and so it's always helpful for us also to be relaxing by we're relaxing the child and there's many other herbs I'll be sharing with you also and I have a full spectrum of these herbs in this book and a lot of detail about them um but I wanted to maybe talk about them when we were making some of the progress because I always find one of the best ways to work with these plants and develop kind of a sense of who they are and how they work for with us is to bring them into our actual Chrome and to use them and I do want to say also that if you have toddlers even children work two and 3 years old and upgrades many of these products are really fun to do with your children again introducing them early into the herbal World um and all its positive aspects you know the ability to look at the world for from the plant Lover's Eyes where you're always looking for beauty always looking for the things that are healthy always recognizing the weeds as your friend you know it's stilling that in children when they're young helps them as they navigate true life and find out about how challenging sometimes life can be so I just really love this way of working with children when they're really young and maybe if you don't mind before we jump into making the products I would like to just read a quote from one of my favorite books on child's care and this is written by one of my earliest teachers it's called Nature's children and this book was written in the 1960s and it was first published in the 1970 by a brilliant herbalist named Juliet derle leby Juliet is world famous I do know that in more recent years some there are younger people who take offense with some of the things that she says very few things but I always like to mention to people that she wrote this book um you know almost 50 years ago and things change and the things that we believe now strongly advocate for and the things that were really most allowed about believe me in 50 years from now you too will have a different voice so what I always like to do is look at the whole life that this person live she had such an amazing influence on the whole animal world and the herbal world so let's just read this a little short statement that she says at the heart of all for Nature's children there will always remain a core of love for the natural life for the fresh vegetables and fruits and whole grains for the Sun the rain the moon and the wind and for snow and for beautiful things in general because their bodies and Minds were formed out of such things when in their mother's wom and in their infancy and childhood this book when I had my son over 50 years ago was one of the very few books actually the only book I could find on natural rearing of children and it was a major inspiration for me um and I still recommend it not so much for the information there is good information in it without a doubt but really for the inspiration I would also like to mention a few of my other very favorite books on herbal child care I always think it's good to have more than one reference so that you get different thoughts and ideas and these are written by incredible herbalists who have had a lot of experience working with children so one's by Dr Mary B Mary B is a naturopathic doctor she's retired now but she ran a woman in children's clinic for many many years and this book is just brilliant an encyclopedia of natural healing for children and infants I add it to my favorite list and then also Dr Aviva Joe Ram who's a a medical doctor as well as an herbalist she also has four children so believe me she has a lot of experiences using herbs for children it's a it's a brilliant book highly recommend it and then our beloved an McIntyre um who's an English herbalist she also has raised two herbal children uh and it's called The herbal mother for mother and child so these are other really good books there's other ones too and I have other recommendations but I would put these at the very top of that list so I me I was mentioning that one of the really ways that become familiar and we recognize the individuality of these herbs and how they work um is by just working with them and using them in our house so household so I want to start with the simplest of of Remedies and that's tea and I think herbal teas for children are some of the most important preparations because they can be used as medicine they can be used as everyday tea you can have tea parties with your children which I think is a fabulous way to introduce children to herbs and also to have your children um introduce herbalism and plants to their friends because well who doesn't love a tea party right um so one of the nice things about when you when you use herbs in tea is that you're using a very benign solvent or menum see liquid that's used to extract the properties of plants so water is probably our most userfriendly menum and um yeah just a great way to use herbs for children but you have to be clever because getting your children to drink those teas especially if they're medicinal takes a little bit of creativity to do that so one of the things that I like doing is I like um making herbal pops with them like freezing them uh you can put herbal tinctures like eonian Elderberry tincture in a really good tea that's an immune formula for your child you can also make them into little Frozen uh cubes so you can add that Cube to water there's all kinds of great ways so this is one thing that you can do when you make your herbal teas is you can make them concentrated um you can also sneak in like eonia tinure Elderberry syrup uh you can use all kinds of great herbs I made Rose hiip this was made with rose hip and hibis bcus I just put them these little pops like this and um and these just make a great way they're herbal tea but they're frozen right and they're really really good for the summertime yeah so I just wanted to make a a basic recipe it's in the book and this is like a a calming blend for children it's not necessarily a sleep aid it's just an herb that you might want to drink in the late have them drink in the late afternoon or if they're being really fussy they're all very very gentle herbs proportions here are not super important because we're using only gentle plants so it doesn't matter if you get a little less of one a little more of the other you can really just formulate it according to your child's plate things but I'm going to use um uh two parts of chamomile and I'm using Parts is going to be a half a cup here so makes it really easy I'm using two parts of Milky oats milky oats is another one of those safe herbs that we use for children it's nourishing well we all know oatmeal right so these are the the Milky Green Oats before the oats fully ripen and these are a wonderful nerving they're really soothing for especially agitation and irritation and we're going to use also two parts of lemon bomb which I talked about a little bit uh earlier what a really wonderful herb this is for children who have a lot of energy and you kind of want to soo them also lemon balb is uplifting to the spirit so just makes kind of lifts the heart lifts the spirits and it's very good when your child's really sad it's a wonderful herb and it tastes delicious too and then I'm going to use one part of catnip and the reason I'm using less catnip is catnip has more of a medicinal action it's not necessarily an herb that we would um just drink for a beverage tea you know we use it when there's a lot of teething pain fussiness uh any kind of pain really it's very very good for relaxing pain or diminishing pain and then I always like to add like something that just gives the blend a little more Sparkle and that will be here we'll be we're going to use these beautiful organic roses and I'm going to use just um one part of the roses and the roses are calming they're s they're relaxing they have vitamin C in them but they also are just added for their beauty and their up again the ability to uplift the heart and then one nice trick that you can do is with your herbs for children and herbs for adults as well is you can add just a little pinch of stevia the stevia is nice because it adds a little bit of sweetness if you add too much it makes it kind of sickeningly sweet so it's just a pinch to a blend um and this will just make a wonderful tea it can also be made into a syrup you could make it into a tincture though there'd be no reason to because it just tastes so wonderful and this would be an herb blend that you could make in this amount and keep it a jar and then just have to serve to your child it can be sweetened with honey if your child is a little bit older it's usually recommended not to use honey for children that are less than one years old and that's because there can be a form of botulism that is in the honey um we see that much more it it's not common or frequent but it can be very very damaging uh so it's recommended not to use honey for really small children I know my teacher Juliet uh she used to use honey all the time but I think at that time you know when you look back 50 years ago we didn't have the problem with the bees that we have today nor were we using the amounts of pesticides and herbicides and fungicides on the plant so I think really the problem that we're seeing with the honey is more the way more what the bees have the resources the bees have to make their honey from rather than the actual honey but it is important to not use honey when children are really young like that so you can use maple syrup you can use rice syrup you can even use Stevia to sweeten it so that's one blend that's really nice um and there's so many different formulas of tease for children both for when they're ill and when they're healthy and vital and these books all have lots of good formulas in them um another nice product that you can make for children and I really recommend this not just for children but for adults as well are sleep or dream pillows um and a lot of people do these now which is great to see for children I don't usually recommend especially small children I would not recommend dream pillows because they're already out in the other worlds and I think a lot of what we try to to do for our children is to bring them here and to kind of ground them and uh to plant them here on the Earth right and so and oftentimes with children it's not that they have problem dreaming they have problem sleeping and so having a little comforting sleep pillow is so lovely um with adults a lot of times we make them into dream pillows to activate our dream state because as we get older a lot of times that dream state becomes flatter so we we want to enter into that dream world as adults but as children something that's comforting um that helps you just to sleep sleep soundly and to be comforted is really important there's lots of different formulas but the formula that I like best again is chamomile that nice nerving formula that we have a little chamomile in it I love lavender too but I didn't have lavender did I bring lavender up no so I would normally put a scoop of lavender in there along with the chamomile and then I'm going to add roses to this it's almost like our dream right um our peaceful key but um and I got to add a little bit of the Roses to it and a little bit of catnip too there's and as I said I usually love adding uh lavender it's just so nice in there but I was out of my lavender jar so that's the thing about being a plant a a cook and an herbalist you just substitute when you don't have something and you don't stress too much about it yeah and then you don't have to scent these but it is really lovely to add just a little bit of pure essential oil to the um to the dream pillow uh you can add I'm going to add just a little bit of lavender to it just to give it a little peaceful calming smell and then carefully carefully measured drops right no we just scent it to where it smells really nice for us and then you just stuff the little pillow this is really a nice size right here and uh and then this beautiful long one could be like a little body bag you can just use it to like put against their back or against their tummy if they're having problems you can warm it up so that it's very comforting but it's like having a little bag of herbs that are comforting and wonderful so these dream pillows and these sleep pillows actually really really work but I think one of the things that they do is they again they're introducing us to herbs on all levels so as we sleep those the fragant sense of those herbs and the energetic of those herbs are kind of creating a safety zone around us and it's just another way to introduce the Plant World children as they're really young so that's another lovely thing you can do and then um I did want to share that uh uh one of the things that I started making very very early in my herbal key career was herbal baby powders because when I first had my son the this is over 50 years ago um there really wasn't any natural body powders on the market baby powders all baby powder contain talc and baby powder was good you know for just if there was like uh excess moisture in the potty area it helped to kind of softened some of the scents it felt good on the skin but all baby powder available had talc in it and the talc um had levels of asbestos in it which you know a little bit of baby powder isn't going to hurt anybody but if you ever watch parents when they used to powder their baby buns and that was every day several times a day so that amount of tout could really make a difference also to the bronchials and the lungs so it was really important to me to make my own powder and when I discovered how easy it was it was just amazing so yeah I think I started one of one of the first baby powder businesses it was called country comfort and it I started making this powder in the 1970s so and again the recipe can change I love using Arrow root so a root is a beautiful herb um and it has a a lovely root that's very nourishing and it's very silky and very absorbent and very very good for the skin so that is the basis of it a lot of times people will make their um their baby powder out of cornstarch that was really a lot of what the housewives used to do long before powder was AA available cornstarch is a okay substitute but it also can grow bacteria really easily and most corn starch is not coming from good sources so unless you can get organic cornstarch I would really say to use the a root it just is a much better absorbent and so then I add uh like one part of white clay the clay is so incredibly medicinal you know Clay when you think about it it's like deposits of life that's thousands of years old right and and it's it's not it's not mud it's like minerals that have been deposited and you know laid out in the sun for and mount and rain storm and moon storms and full moons and you name it it's just been evolving and I was thinking know you put that on your skin and it's like it's just amazing holy stuff I love clay and I use it a lot in my medicines and my products so I had a little bit of of um of the uh clay to it and I was talking so much I added actually the same amount normally I would add to one part of Arrow root I would add half a part of clay it just keeps it a little lighter and then another thing that I always like to add is um marshmallow powder now I used to add slippery elm powder because again it was so healing for the skin but slippery elm has become very endangered because of um in its in the landscape because of the Dutch elm disease we really encourage people not to use it unless they really have to unless they know their sources so marshmallow root powder which is commonly cultivated and a very common weed actually has very similar properties so we're going to add that to it and we just mix it around you can you can use it just like that it's fine just the way it is but sometimes it's just nice to add a little fragrance so again you can add a little bit of lavender you have to make sure that you're using pure essential oils and not using a lot it should be subtle maybe just enough to help you know just to lift the odor a little bit I love using um Sweet Orange actually or Tangerine or grapefruit for the just the kind of fresh smell that that gives if you are using essential oil you just sprinkle a little bit on it will Clump you add enough so that you get a nice fragrance I'm going to add a little bit more and then there's an extra step and that's what you want to let this all dry in there yeah that's great and then I would just cover it with a with a porous cloth just for a couple hours maybe overnight and that just allows it to kind of dry nicely and then I'll whiz it again and you can do um you can put your powders in any kind of container that you have but I love these powder containers that you get they're cardboard you can get these from many herbal supply companies I think I got this one from Mountain Rose but you can find them sometimes in natural food stores they just make it very convenient but if you don't have these you can use other containers this was just a recycle container that I had and I just put something Fancy on the outside just some wrapping paper little glass you can use these I don't recommend having a lot of glass containers around small children so even though I love glass and recommend it for most of our herbal products when you're making products for children that you're going to have around when you're changing their diapers or after the bath I do recommend often times using your plastic just because for safety F factors it's so easy for a little leg or arm to go out and kick something off the shelf right so um yeah so there's any kind and if you are using um a container like a plastic container a glass one you can get a little duster a little Powderpuff that you just use but yeah really really good good product that's so simple to make totally safe and really inexpensive to make so yeah and then another nice product that you can make for your children are um oils that you can use for bath oils you can use the oils with their skin gets dry you can make special oils if your child ever your your small child ever gets cradle cap um you know which is not a huge problem but it's just a sign that there's they're sebaceous glands aren't functioning well and can look kind of awful their head can be peeling they can look like they have a little sores on their head it's really not an issue but if you make a nice herbal oil and you massage that into your into their head and then just let it sit there for a little while it's very easy to clean off those dead cells it also stimulates the scalp it's good for the scalp there's all kinds of wonderful oils this is an example of an oil that you can use as a as a bath as a body oil for uh for the problem with the scalp and it's just a a blend of uh colula I just use colula and comfrey in this blend both very very healing herbs and I made like it makes like a beautiful golden oil um you can do you can make this by putting it in a jar like this and Loosely putting the lid on and then putting it in a small pan or a pot and just letting it cook slowly just you this pot would have water in it so you're kind of making a double boiler here and you just let it sit for maybe on a low heat for maybe an hour or two until the oil is warm never hot or boiling and it's infusing the qualities of those plants the chemical constituents of the plants in the oil the oil actually looks different when I pour this off it's golden has a different odor a slight odor that's Herby and that oil can be used just that way um but we could also turn it into product which I'm going to show you in a minute my favorite way of making these oils by the way isn't so much the double boiler method this is quick and easy and I've used this many times but whenever I'm being thoughtful and thinking about a product that I'm making I usually make these the solar and using the sunlight the big huge powerful sun to extract the property of the plants into this beautiful plant oil so um yeah I just love making solar oil so simply to make a solar oil you put your herbs same amount of herbs cover them with just about an inch or two of oil put a tight fitting lid on and set this out in the hot sun now any of you who know about oils would say that's a big no no because that oil will go rancid but there's a certain bit of magic in making herbal products and for some reason that I can't explain I'm waiting for somebody to tell me why this is but when the herb is infusing in the oil in the sun it very seldom goes rancid it stays it keeps its Integrity as a good oil if I st that herb out and then put the oil in the hot sun within a few days five or six days this oil will be very rancid and as we all know these days we don't ever want to use rancid oils internally or externally because they're extremely toxic on the body so once you have an herbal oil you can you can make a number of things with it you can add a little bit of beeswax and make a Sav that you can use as for OES infections uh rashes also for cradle cap um so you can you can take your really beautiful herbal oil that you've made and turn it into a SV simply by adding beeswax um the proportion is usually to one cup of oil it's about a four of a cup of beeswax though I do want to warn you a cup of Sav is a lot of Sav I think that's why there's so many Sav companies because so many people made a cup and went what am I going to do with 8 ounces of Sav this is like a half ounce of Sav and that Sav will last you probably the whole toddler toddlerhood of your child so um Sav can also be used on diaper rashes where there's a lot of dryness and irritation if there's a lot of moisture then you don't want to put more moisture on that because it will agitate it so we use something a little more drying like a like a baby powder but the other nice thing that we can make with our oils is make these beautiful lotions um this is probably one of the more complicated formulas that I have not that it's really complicated you make an herb oil and then to U usually the proportions and you don't have to try to remember these they're all written down for you and you can also get them off the web too but um usually the proportions that I use to about 2/3 cup of liquid oil I add about 1/3 cup of solid oil and that's solid oil can be koui nut it can be coconut butter these are I like using the cocoa butter and baby products cuz it smells just like chocolate is Rich and thing uh rich and very moisturized you can also use uh coconut oil so for every 2/3 cup or excuse me 34 cup of liquid oil it's about A3 cup of of H solid oil to that and and then um I add a little bit of beeswax so for every cup of oil that I have I'll add about a a tablespoon of beeswax um and that's just to make it a little bit more solid so that's what this is in here it's about 2/3 cup of liquid oil to about 1/3 cup of solid oil and a little bit of beeswax I melted it all together and this is the consistency I have that in itself makes it incredible lotion it can be an after bath lotion for a baby and this is made with that beautiful colula ComFree so it's very healing and beautiful but it's also nice to make a lovely lotion with it that you can use all over your baby you can use as they have and and toddlers and teens and any children of any age or adults cuz it's so lovely so what I do at this point to make it into a lotion is I will add a liquid and usually I add a a distilled water you can use tap water but um if you're using tap water from the city uh it can have a lot of bacteria in it so I usually recommend if you're in city water on City water it's really good to use distilled water for CH for this children's recipe I would use aloe vera gel because I want this to be very very healing and aloe vera gel of itself is a really really wonderful healing uh herb and in fact if you have young children old children old adults in the house it's always nice to have an aloe plant because if you get a burn a sunburn or a burn from cooking um if you get a bad rash just going and getting that Alo Leaf you know asking permission taking that leaf opening it up and taking that gel and putting it on the burn or this or the infection is so soothing or rough skin is really good as it's one of my actually favorite cosmetic tricks is almost every night I just take raw fresh aloe and rub it on my face anyway uh in this lotion we're going to use aloe vera gel because uh it I wanted to make this a super healing gel and I'll add a little bit of water too we're on well water so I'm just going to use my water um if I was giving this away to friends or you know selling it or whatever I would definitely not use tap water even my well water for it I'd use a distilled water or rose water but um for home purposes this works great so you can do this yourself um but it's always just a little bit easier if you have a friend so I'm going to invite Helen H do you mind coming and help me with this H yeah and I do want to share that I used to always make this cream um in a blender and a blender works great in all of my early books and all of my early recipes say to use a blender but I have fallen in love with the immersion blender for one thing you have one pot that you can heat all this stuff up in and it's so much easier to clean up and if I have leftover cream that doesn't fit in my cream jar I can just put a lid on and I'll put it in the refrigerator it'll last for months in there so anyway and it always works out but the thing with using this is you have to have two hands well forehand and I so I'm going to have you hold this here honey for a minute and I'm actually going to usually I make these in court jars so you don't need to do this I've never made it in a pint jar it's always good never to do something like this in front of an audience but I'm going to do it this way cuz I don't want it to spill over and we we have to leave a little funnel there so I'm going to get it going Helen and then you're going to slowly add this let's move all this over so people can see and then you're going to slowly add that in there ready yeah let me get it going high whoops that's slow make it go there we go okay okay now maybe we won't need this if it doesn't splatter up we'll take it off but I just didn't want it to Splatter over oh let's take it off and see what happens okay let's risk it okay good there we go you can add a little more more Hello more look beautiful look beautiful already right okay let's see yeah I'm going to go just a little bit more little more yeah let's do it all rest yeah let's put it all in there there you go okay so I'm going to just show you what this looks like so you have this beautiful beautiful cream it looks almost like whipped cream and you could eat it you actually could eat it everything in there's edible I don't think you'd want to but this beautiful cream is so rich and so nice and will be lovely on your look at that so can you see how beautiful that turned out what do you think you want to try a little bit honey this is a very very rich cream so you don't it doesn't have any fillers in it so you just need a little bit but this was made particularly for young children and baby skin and as I said I usually always store my um oh my hands are all greasy can you open that I always store them in glass containers but when I'm working around small children I think it's better to keep them in a little you know have a small amount in a plastic jar so we'll just put that in there and any leftover you you don't have to store it in the refrigerator you can definitely store it in a cool place it's it's nothing in here will go bad it won't spoil it should last for months and months look at that how beautiful that looks it's really and sometimes you can add a little scent to it but because I use the cocoa butter in here it has like a really chocolaty like baby beautiful odor want to hold it up and we'll show people what that looks like yeah so yeah so this is really just a variation on the my famous face cream recipe um but it can be used all over baby's body and be really good so there's lots of other things that we can make I think I'll show you one more thing that I have a lot of fun with I this is not an original recipe in fact I learned this from other people but is making gummies they're so simple and I decided I wanted to make vegan gummies I'm a vegetarian I don't really like to use gelin it was just as simple as taking Helen's marvelous um Elderberry s syrup Helen is famous for her Elderberry syrup so this was Elderberry syrup that Helen made in the recipes in the book and then all I did I took um the recipe in the book calls for one cup of Elderberry syrup and uh two teaspoons of egar egar powder this is for the vegan gummies there's also a gummy recipe for um just making it with for regular with gelatin but this is I want as I said I wanted to try the egar and egar egar is a seaweed a very very nourishing and mucilaginous seaweed that just firms um liquid up so I just took I decided not to make a cup because I would have a zillion gummies so I took a half a cup and one teaspoon of agar and I made these fabulous little gummies that are like little flowers I don't know I'll put them on a platter and pass them around um they're really beautiful and really sweet and really cute um and so it's just another way if you were making these are made with Elderberry so we can say that they're you know immune formulas they're good for colds Etc they're also just good as a tonic because they're high in vitamin C they're very nutritious if I wanted to make them really medicinal I could also add a little bit of eonia to the syrup I could add eonia tincture I could take my little tincture bottle and the little dropper and put a little drop of eona in each one so we can be really really super creative but yeah little jellies it was so much fun to make them it took me like I made them last night it took me like 10 minutes really because I just mix the i whis i whisk the um teaspoon of uh agar into the uh Elderberry syrup I heated it up for like like 5 minutes on the stove and then I poured it into my little containers here this is what took so much time is getting it into these little things yeah so there's so many wonderful things many of these recipes can be made with your children um some of most of them they can be made not for Illness but for good health for Vitality for introducing our children to the world of plants um and then they also make incredibly good home medicine for almost I would say for the majority of illnesses that come up for children you know parents have been helping their children through all kinds of um Health crisis since the beginning of time and thankfully we also have good medical professionals we have naturopathic doctors and herbalists who can also be support for us when we you know feel like we need to reach out so but definitely get to know your plants and introduce your children to the world of herbs at a young age tell me what makes you weary tell me what lights up your eyes I'll meet you there in the mle
