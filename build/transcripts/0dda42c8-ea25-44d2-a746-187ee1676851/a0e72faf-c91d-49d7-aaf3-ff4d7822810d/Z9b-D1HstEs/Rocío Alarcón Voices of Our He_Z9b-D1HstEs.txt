hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced by herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant and healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do the song of a bird and I can feel the [Music] sky I know that that I'm part of the earth when I see the sunrise I am thankful to be [Music] here my welcome guest today is one of my dearest friends and teachers she's a sister of my heart Dr Rosia Alicorn Rosia is an herbalist a shamanic practitioner ethnobotanist and she also has a PHD in ethal Pharmacology she's really brigant but more than anything Rosio is a remarkable human being with a heart of gold or perhaps we should say a heart of green she's a true healer and Shaman Shaman trained in the lineage of her mother and grandmother and comes from a long lineage of healers she has spent over 40 years working with the ethnic groups of the rainforest in the Andes Mountains of her Homeland Ecuador and those people love her I've watched their her interaction with them and just seeing the incredible love and respect they have for Rosio Rosio is the co-founder and director of a beautiful Retreat Healing Center deep in the heart of the rainforest the Amon Center and lucky for all of us Rio invites people to her Retreat Center to offer classes and ceremonial programs she also teaches classes around the world too but going to visit Russo in her Homeland is like a life changing expanding experience so for a full body and information on Rio's programs you can visit our website or you can link directly to Rio's information so roio just thank you so much for joining us today I'm so honored and privileged to have you with us hello Dr good morning evening good afternoon whatever in the planet but thank you for this invitation thank you so much it's a honor for me to share time with you uh because you are the brid in the planet you you join the people and create the amazing energy for us is a honor to share time with you thank you thank you darling well I think it's always fun to start with how we first met you know as our as you know really for me our meeting was lifechanging you know just meeting you and having the experience that I had with you had expanded so much in my life do you remember how we first met in that first trip when I brought a group to Ecuador to meet you and how really life-changing it was for everyone I'd love to hear your you tell your perspective of that of that meeting and that trip if you would yes of course I never forget the day that my phone was ringing very loud and I answered I was in my house and that sweet voice saying are you Rosio alaron and I said yes I am and you say we had a group of women somebody give me your phone number and I would like to talk with you and yes I say yes yes yes because at that period I didn't understand what you were saying but I say yes for all the things and it's not because uh because I could say no but I say yes because the vibration and relationship of the hearts were together I feel that that sensation so after that you give me the address think that I understood perfectly well and I went to this little H and I saw this group of women talking and suddenly this beautiful lady appeared with a long hair and say hi I'm TR Mary and I was I open my mouth and I said oh my God she's so beautiful and that was the first time that we join in that group and you explained to me that you would like to to visit places and to learn about plants that's all yeah and yeah and what I was doing is just imagine a trip with this fantastic group of women at that period I didn't know who these people because if I know it probably I will say no because the power of that group The the incredible classic herbalist de Soul G Anderson oh yes I do many classic educators of people from United States educators in the way of the green the challenges the the courage so I was surrounded by these people but I never knew it I never knew it and what I was doing is just organized the Cano and in I yes permission to my boss and he said do whatever Roso it's not a problem you know what you are doing and I invite the local people I was working with the people in the Pacific region and we went there traveling to the enormous river the the cayapas river oh yeah sanago River traveling until it's what it was dark and the river was growing than God the people didn't see the enormous river we did see it we were terrified and you were singing singing and and we both together say look the Stars like the the lights on the river the fish and these little insects but flights shining it was magic it was magic amazing you know Ros I I wanted to share with you you know like even before I met you just I that when you said it was just that energy of connection you know where where people who are maybe part of the same tribe you know part of the green energy tribe we recognize each other because really before I even met you I was given your name I was looking for people to go and visit in these other countries right and I just was when I heard your name and I read a little bit about you I was drawn you know it was like one of those connections that was meant to be and it as I said it was really life-changing not only for myself but for all the people who then have gone to study with you and learn from you in your Homeland it was really astounding yeah can you share with us how your interest in Shamanism and plants began I didn't have Cho I born in family I born in that family that since I remember my first my first relation with with the plants when I was in a bathing place but made by Gooden period and and I was with plants floating in the water clean cleaning all the body and singing and that was my first memory so oh and after I was I was two years old and I have very clear very clear Vision me walking under the big tree that is still the tree is there has I don't know who knows how many years and I was under the tree and I'm I have that Vivid image of the tree talking to me and I say to my mom to my granny granny the tree is talking to me and she said yes yes so for foran was so normal and and for my family but when I went to the school and I said this is happening in the in the in the land of my grand oh my God they didn't want to hear it yeah so um but that was the first the first memory and after just walking in the middle of the river in the did you remember Rosemary in that little area in this biggest stone that we were walking in the land of my granny I definitely remember that yeah that River was so normous now tiny amount of water we are finishing with the green but at that period the water coming down and Mom say always you remove all the clothes and jumping into the water and she was anxious because she say my God the river can bring you who knows you can die don't go don't go but day by day I was going there yeah so so so really since you were just a young child this has been and I do know that your grandmother and your mother also have were very very important early teachers for you you come from a very powerful line of women a long lineage of healers um do you have any like and one of the things I want to mention that I've you know just admired and loved about you is how your family has all lived together so in your in your household you know it's very traditional but it's your granddaughter your daughter yourself your mother your grandmother of course has passed on and then the guys are there too the husbands but it's really this very strong lineage of women so I can you share maybe one or two of the most important lessons and teachings that you learned from your grandmother or a story about your grandmother yes of course I was a very um I was crying mom say that when I borned I was crying all the time and and Granny all the time say she needs a ceremony so time passed and of course I suppose that I had ceremonies But after when I was in in my with my brain with memories one of the magic times for me is when Granny make for me a necklace but make with the fruits of a a a little fruits he tied me and put me here and I feel so proud so I was going into the mdor of my granny and looking all the time it's nothing with the stones or something no it was the fruits with a p piece of red um little piece of of cotton very simple and she and and she said don't remove don't remove so I think that all the week I stay with that until the fruits of course got very dry and Granny was treating in in the in the fruits when she remov it so time pass and I love that little fruits it's into the solania family I wanted to know what is this and when when I was 12 years old I went into the the woodlands and collecting this and eating all the time and I love it so I came back and I said granny this is delicious and she said yes you should eat is so good for your digestion and make you feel so relaxed so uh this is one of the plants that really um triggered my curiosity and I fell in love with the first plant because I feel so attractive with the with the necklace and that's one of the plants that that I love with all my heart and make me sad because now people is coting is making opening the the borders of the goodlands and this plant needs wild areas to grow and the fruits are delicious and very healthy so now I'm doing research and what is saying in the Andes mon is that this plant protects of the B bad vibrations oh protect essential oils and this is essential oils make the person feel sleepy and you can sleep nice and so granny know it I love how she protected you with a necklace you know something that you could put on your body and feel beautiful and that's yes so amazing what what is the plant again that you're talking about what's the name of it Sol and um it's a tiny fruit and um I don't remember now the scientific name but it's it's very hard to find I was so lucky I was in a worship with a group of uh students I think that seven years ago and I use a necklace because I went to find the plant and I was doing like granny and I put two students ask me what is that because I wanted to to see how the plan called the attention of the people and two students as what is this plan and I say in the future we are going to study the power of some plants yeah and how they can protect us and it's so simple the science can explain for the physical and for the spiritual we need the spiritual explanation coming from the kurand deros what people call shamans yeah and and yes it's a special plant that produce special chemical substances that make us feel so protected so healthy and relaxing so fantastic and and of course in the spiritual side is the power is the power of the like my granny say is this the power of this spirit that is growing in the goodlands and appear to you yes yeah that's pretty amazing I love that about you you know you have all You' you've researched and studied gone to college you have all that science but you really come so you have the knowledge for certain you know I really love that and I've seen you work you know doing your ethnobotanical skills but what I really love is you have such a spiritual relationship not only with the plants but with the people of the forest you know in the mountains so it's it's really beautiful to watch that thank you so much R but one of the things that really um after that plan the other was I was so lucky to Born In the period where not enough toilet paper not enough toilet paper for that because that allowed me to learn about women uses of the plants in different areas of the body and how people whatever men or women or whatever uh people can can clean your the body so and and to go to the to well they didn't have toilets we didn't have toilets in the land of M granny they have um lrin LR your out houses we call them yes yes right so but always to to walk to the that area you have a specific path of plants there and and that is one of the memories that I have and I saw only in the are of my granny and I keep the memory because I grow with here learning there and and now I talk with my mom and say mom what was that then and of course we laugh and she say you know when we were walking because people to go to that area women to go to that area in the darkness always walk in groups not in Visions not the private no they were walking in PE and talking about who knows and they were collecting the leaves oh yes as they walk yes yes they collect a specific leaves to clean doing our needs and and after that I decided to collect the plants and to know what is happening with these plants and you know what these plants have essential oils antiseptic essential oils oh essential oil C yes when you clean this these areas prevent infections oh wow clean the hands with these antiseptic lips because the essential oils that they have amazing to clean that areas so now I'm writing a paper about that that's so beautiful the power of these plants in house some people like my granny she was putting the plants planting in the trail of the toilet if I can say and and the environment was green because we didn't use so much um to paper we use the leaves and at the same time you if you didn't have water because Granny always have little amount of water there if you don't have you have the leaves that yes can clean the hands and can protect of infections it's so much more civilized honestly to use these biodegradable gifts from the earth right that are just meant to be used for all kinds of things it just makes so much more sense you I know uh this is a funny little story about toilet paper but when coid happened the the Americans just went out of their mind over toilet paper right there was this Rush on buying toilet paper of all things and it was like sold out it was like it was like really um a pandemic over toilet paper and it just was astounding to me because all around us we have these very natural substances that are so easy to use and so much as actually as I said in many ways so much more cleansing as you were sharing you know they have their own essential oils and yeah it's plant have so many gifts they give us don't they so I I'd love to see this article that you're writing on on natural toilet paper or is it going to be on the plants and how you can use them as yes it's into one family of plants it's so simple because after I wanted to know what familial plants and I went to the jungle and the and the wanis and the kofan the kitua these different friends yes they use the same family of plants and they say this is amazing all the people this connection with plants you don't need to you don't need to discover no it's there and the connection how people from Highland how people from lowland are using probably the same family of plants and why do you think that is foro that is the spiritual connection that is how we live other dimension with the plants plants give us all to give our life healthy fantastic and precious always yes but we forgot and and we are using different other things like plastic I'm sorry but yes I AG why not the plant why not we we don't put a path of plants to to clean our hands yeah it's so true yeah I love what you were just saying you know like there's this Universal knowledge that comes from the plants all around the world and it you know some you know it is true that there are some people hear that language of the plants and can communicate it but really it's there for everybody and that's what you teach people like you know you take them out so they actually begin engaging with the plants and we all are able to receive that information you know it's it's such an ancient relationship we have with them and I think that is one of the things that you do really so incredibly well is just connect people with their heart to the plant so they're actually learning from the plants right it's a little bit like you know like we so many people go to church and they listen to a priest to speak to God but you can really learn to speak to Creator or God or the goddess directly you know it's that it's that same kind of relationship that we have with the plants so beautiful yeah Rosia I I know that you have a very very special relationship with the hummingbirds which I think is so interesting because it in like I think you're one of the main Messengers for the hummingbirds at a time when the hummingbirds seem to have a very special message for people right now and that you know everywhere I see images you know creeping up and you see them on cards and you see them everywhere and I think in part that's because of your you know your voice for the hummingbirds have been very clear and loud but I'd love to hear uh both your relationship about the hummingbirds and then also what message you think they're bringing to the world right now I think that the we people who borned in America whatever north south uh Central all all of us we are very blessed to born in the land of the hummingbirds and when I say the land of the haming birds at the same time is the the coevolution between haming birs plants and the hamers talk with the plants they make love and say let's go to to make something for the humans let's go to do something because these beans are so little arogant and they they have this incredible love for us they know that we depend on the Sun to produce some vitamins yeah and to to to to to feel healthy so they decided to be the how to I say the ambassadors of the Sun the ambassadors of the other dimension okay and and that is how how they put in the coevolution between this plant and between this hummingbear they say let's go to put the humans there we need to support them and the flowers they were so nervous they said how excuse me we are so happy between you and me we can make love without any problem that's why I love that picture where this has the long big and making love with the with that brancia that's beautiful yeah but H bir they say come on I can love the humans too so they accepted and the humming B can heal us because many reasons it's not just recently but we have the Traditions I suppose that in All In All America 5,000 years ago in my country the the ceramic with the Dr of hming birs with different me messages there all all sending messages about the power of these simple tiny little creatures but the only unique unique birds in the planet that can fly to the front go put the feet up and shut the energy when they look at you they can talk with the sun and send the energy to to the to the people when we are doing the workships people didn't believe how they transform from this species you can see it's different completely like a bowl of sun shining and strong energies for us amazing healing us I live that experience I I live that experience and of course I came from my granita she love hummingbirds she love hummingbirds I remember that when I was probably four years old she has a window there and I saw this like a little fly because so tiny and was touching the window of Granny oh and he said what is that that fly granny don't touch it's not a fly it's a hummingbear and he was doing a nest near to the oh my God I can believe it how beautiful how that's I kept in my heart that never forget yeah never forget so that was the passion and when Granny put the first br which now are one of the biggest in my country and I'm not saying that one one famous uh engineering foresty engineer he went to visit and said don't C this these granas are so incredible and all the L members going there and singing Amazing so I fell in love just because Granny fell in love and how the information coming and I decided in honor of my granny to create the oracle of the of the of the humming birds I remember that story is so amazing yeah these are just beautiful that these beautiful oracles that you made um that are just beautiful depictions of the hummingbirds and then also the just the wisdom you know and I keep these I love how you made them because you made them so you can just stand them up like this right so I keep them right next to my bed and I start every morning I start my my day by drawing a a hummingbird and then just reading about it yeah there just amazing you I I um I don't know if I ever told you the story but when I used to organize that big International herb Symposium which you came to and just graced us with your presence every year I would always do ceremony before the event you know just to call on all the spirits to be with us and you know just to just because it was such an incredible thing to bring people from all over the the world actually to study together and one day always something amazing would happen right there would be I wake I'd open my eyes and there'd be a rainbow or you one time there was a moose walking by it was pretty funny but this one time Robert and I were praying and when I Robert whispered he goes open your eyes open your eyes and I opened my eyes and there was a hummingbird right at my lips like like my lips were the flower and it was just transmitting this energy into me it was really really very beautiful um yeah I just want to thank you so much for the Oracle and the teaching of the hummingbirds because you know I didn't even realize that hummingbird's only range was North and sou in South America you know this the Americas like you said I didn't realize they were found nowhere else in the world so we're very graced by that you know to have these amazing amazing little creatures with us and of course all the plants that they are touching they bring the vi of the hamers for the planet that is the benefit because they when the Conor is arve with some of the species from Europe the H members love it they go crazy and people can bring the memories of the humming BS and put in the gardens and and bring the vibration I'm doing that here in in in in England I I I have flowers that the hamers L in my in my country and I put here and the vibration of the H is coming we can meditate with that vibration and they listen they come immediately and support you and whatever situation they are the main healers they I say they are the little Shaman the little supporting us oh that's very very beautiful you're you're like one of the little hummingbirds actually this little very energetic little Buzzy person who has this enormous energy I think that's why they've chosen you to bring the teachings of their you know their spiritual teachings to the world actually yeah let's talk a little bit about the um C the indigenous families and cultures that you've worked with I think that was one of the things that so um I had the Good Fortune to lead many trips with with Rosio to Ecuador right and they were they were like I would say they were like National Geographic because Rosio would take us way off the beaten Trail I mean there were no trails and to Villages where they really had not welcomed groups or even had um visitors from North America come so it was very very what would I say a very spiritual journey for us all and then I can use that word again lifechanging that I'm not saying that lightly but one of the things that I always noted everybody did was the incredible love and respect that these communities and had for you and that you had back for them it was truly amazing you know like we oftentimes wonder how we can help and we're very awkward in that but I always saw that you not you didn't just wonder you just jumped in and were there you know and really bringing breding gifts and also receiving gifts from these people so I just was wondering if you would share a little bit about your work with the indigenous cultures and how you got into that and yeah and maybe just a story or two if you'd be willing yes I I really love uh I love the people from the forest yeah I think that this planet needs to give the the real value to these people who live in the forest because they are the last Hunters the last um collectors the last real human beings living in the forest yeah when I see this these mature people which for us we say uh they are all they are thir AG I don't believe in that when I see per going to the to the top of the tree with 83 years old and he go to the top collect the fruits and bring for me make me cry these type of things are these actions make me make me feel so lucky to share time with them and when one of the stories that really one of the times is not recently it is like a I will say eight years ago or nine years ago I don't remember I invite my ex ex Professor from the University here I said now is my revenge after I finish my I finish and I invite him to go to the Jungle he was so nervous he said what I'm going to bring jungle is danger I come on come and you will okay so of course never went he he's one of the top researchers in the planet many many articles but in the laugh and I respect that that's very important but it's so important to go to the field I always I'm saying it's nice to go in Google and see the information see the maps see the chemical components but the most important point is to learn into the nature yes to to em into the nature to understand whatever science from art until the molecular whatever so I invite him we went we were in in our Center and I invite the top the top um healer and who is a he's the only one that now he's doing Kur Kur is the the paralyze paralyze the muscles to have the interventions in the theater so still we are using day byday in theaters it's not only the but the Kur to paralyze the muscles make relax and the the guy who is scooting can make the intervention without the beating of the muscles oh wow anyway this this this this fantastic for me is a incredible teacher he's guani and he was there very simple very humble and I said pgo please can we go to visit our forest and look for Kur oh boy all that green and all that Vines of course I knew it because I I I'm living there and he said roio he is and he obtained the the bark he could the bark and only obtain the chemical components the inside of the B and he make a special instrument to collect mix with the exact amount of water and allow the the molecular to come down and collecting another piece of liap and after we arrive to the center and he make the fire and put that fluid and put exactly temperature because if you put more can break can destroy the molecu he put exactly amount and suddenly something very heavy he put at the end of the dart and say don't touch this is going to be needs to be cold and he obtain the chemical component un unbelievable my tutor he was in me and he was crying and he say he is a PhD forgive me forgive me for me my arrogant my God I want to learn with you how you can do that without instruments I need my laboratory to do this yeah amazing huh you that was the teaching in the experience for me that is always the experience for me in each each kurand in each Shaman that I met in the jungle yeah because in each of them the wisdom the vibration from the other dimension giving to us and transforming each cell in our bodies using the power of the plants and he was doing that with my my my my extor he was doing that he transformed immediately not with a ceremony no but this is a a chemical ceremony is pure science spiritual science I call it spiritual science transform yeah just since that day he's crazy he wants to go back and he respect so this is one of the stories that really make me feel so touch and how how that's my lesson always and that's what I want in each person who's going to Yami Center be touched for the pl by the plants yes and by the the people who manage for Generations the wisdom yes that can move from the physical to the spiritual to the emotional and bringing all the best energy for all of us yes so that those are the spirits just incredible I just get chills and I was listening to you know that was one of that was another thing grao that I really noticed was you know so many of these people in these little Villages you know like they also what I would feel like when you would bring these people bring us to listen to them and we were so in awe it really helped I think it helped Empower them as well you know because I think they were at a time when they weren't being Listen to As Much even within their Village you know even even in these remote places things were changing there's so much disruption going on in The Villages so the work that you were doing in bringing this kind of cultural exchange um and bringing people down like your professor like us like you know like plant lovers from North America you know to really honor them because we were so you know so respectful and honored by it I think it really I could watch them feeling really um proud of what they knew recognizing it was a they know it's of Great Value but it when people when your communities aren't listening to you anymore you begin to feel useless right so that was one of the dynamic exchanges that I personally saw over the many years that we would go down with you you know had so much respect for these communities and these people I remember I'm thinking right now I'm thinking of so many things popping into my mind but one was when we went to that little village um where we held that clinic you know where all the Villager brought all their people and this was a village nobody came to you know it was a very poor mistio Village so it was not you know it was kind of divided and kind of isolated from both the Spanish and the ethnic communities and yet you would select these villages to bring people to because you could see they had so much wisdom do you remember that time yes yes except in that place is where uh we have yam Center oh in that when we went with you I knew it that's something there and and now all the community all the community car the center and car the forest is a big change it's a big change and then they respect the other the other communities from in indigenous have a good relationship but of course it's a matter of time and and respecting giving the examples leing the example I I don't want to say no no no but just live together and say if you are visiting yam Center we accept everybody yeah doesn't matter could be black white yellow brown male female we don't care about religions about nothing you are here and I don't want to see people fighting because in no is enough so now when they have problems they are going let's talk about the yoi center a little bit you know I was there um in the very early days you know right I think you founded it right right in the early like early 1990s right is when you were able to get that land and what was your vision for that Center that was that is so um special really I saw this place it was close and it was Gooden houses there and I say oh who is the owner and the owner was somebody from from Kito from from the and I went to ask and she say I'm going to sell that I don't like it so I invite my friends and we put our pokemony at that period and we bought the piece of land at that period was like um 50 hects and we bought that and for me was a big surprise that after that my friends didn't have time but I I fell in love and I decided to to to understand the the forest to understand what is the offer of the forest and now yamamo Center is the center of biodiversity in the planet is one of the places with the highest number of tre wow eat the planet it's brutal amazing that's one and the other important is that we are surrounded by the local different H cultures like the you met the when the when the Shan died did you remember the the so the guis and the K Wow what else we need what else we need they are our neighbors and and all of them uh supporting us and bringing different plants and now we have a huge Garden that we call the the goddess garden because we have different types of Master plants we have different varieties of aasa different varieties of combinations but because the people love love to work in that and bring plants medicinal plants and so that yam is growing all the time and we offer workshops for children and and for women especially working with women that they need more support when you say like the children and the women is it from the local Villages that they come as well because I know that you it's one of the places that you invite uh people from other countries to come down and study with you which is so remarkable but I didn't realize are you doing the classes for the local loal people as well yes uh we we create we transform yamoo in the the the class for the people and we work with the school and invite during summertime because for many of this the children it's so difficult to learn about computer about and they they don't feel happy but they need to study so I invite some of the volunteers and some people from UK some young people they went and they were teaching there computer teaching English and they were learning with the local people uh Spanish so they love it and the parents see that this the the children are so happy learning computer in the school and and we are offering and at the same time the elders teaching about the medicinal plants or about the master plants and bringing plants to identify to learn so beautiful and you do lots of crafts there too I know as well you support the local crafts because every every time we go down we come back with all those beautiful Forest you know our necklaces and Beads and the craft is just exquisit it's you know it's so um rare to find these these native natural crafts like children doing this type of here again Plants that's why I love I love plants and you see what is this is the children doing these little things a toy coming from the plants and produce pounds and produce yeah is relative of the beans growing on the top of the trees lucky se you know Rosia you've mentioned the the master plant several times and I was going to ask you you know in the Plant World you have a special Ally and I know that you do work really closely with the master plan so would you share I think a lot of our listeners don't really know what you mean by the master plan so you could just share and your relationship with them is which is very very special so thank you in reality the the master plans are are special plants sometimes I'm I try to understand and yes we have like the rose aromatic es quisitive Aroma not other plant can offer that like that Rose specific Rose or a a specific edible plants but in this case we are talking about H these plants that have the skill have the skill to produce to produce moleculas that the brain can produce and we call neurotransmisor English that neurotransmission we produce that in our in our brain these neurotransmission and suddenly this master plants can produce something identical wow something identical and they can come here and be the neurotransmitters and produce our body through the what we call the the union between one neuron other we call synapsis in Spanish I'm Sor synapsis but yes but with this new neurotransmitters with the master PLS chemicals there and transmitting the wisdom of the plant that not all the plants can do that these are only the master plants how the people 5,000 years ago they discovered that I'm not going to say how because I in my view I have the the local information from my grannies from the groups in the Amazonian in the Pacific region I work with 65 different kuros different different shamans and I was so lucky to understand how the wisdom allowed them to make different combin ations different combinations of Master plants I'm happy now I can see that now the plants the the the aaska which is one of the master plants very popular now this lady and combined with this other and this beverage is called now together with two plants aaska but aaska is one plant and combined with others but now it's like only one plant and we are going to lose the wisdom of many many many different plants that people can combine and these people can combine and can produce fantastic movements of our physical body going to another dimension to heal to heal the problems that humanity is is having now and one of the now you can read many papers about the potenti potentialities of the aasa beverage in the way of anxiety post-traumatic syndrome um depression and and celare this problems with the brain is because they have this skill when people drink they they combine and one to stop some of the problem some of the enzymes that we have in the gut and doesn't allowed us to to to to go to the to the dream area so theka has that skill stop that en in our gut and the other plant say ah now I'm free and I'm going to make this person to move to the dream go we can go we can feel relax and we can enjoy the beauty of the other dimension so we are doing day by day when we are eating chocolate it's the same it's a master plan yeah that's what is doing the master chocolate is this molecular theob bromine that make us feel so happy so happy thank you so much sweetie you know I know that in um many of the ceremonies that I participated with you the there were the healing ceremonies that we did with these shamans it was the shaman who would drink the the tea that he would take the ceremonial liquid and then he would do the healings or he might give his patients just a small amount so there would be that meeting ground but he would be the one who would be using his body you know it's really a great incredible service he would use his body to travel and you know really understand the herbs to bring back so I think it it seems to me that what we're seeing is the way that people are using it today who don't have this lawn cultural relationship with it is not always the best way or the most respectful way you know I think that um as a younger generation disconnected from our lineage and our traditions we often don't remember the responsibility and respect that go with some of the tools that we learn you know I have great empathy because I'm one of those people myself you know learning to connect with lineage and Heritage but I just see that you know so oftentimes when we disconnect from the actual Community where or the community not just of people but also the community of plants where these plants come from we also are also disconnect from the tradition so yeah it's a lot it takes a lot of teaching I think people whenever possible should go to where the medicine is and where the the shamans are the healers who know that work but yeah and you're doing wonderful work breeding people to the to the plants you show us you take us out into the jungle you know and show us these beautiful plants I remember one walk that we were doing with you U Down in the Amazon and Cascade was with us our beloved Cascade since passed away I have pictures of her standing underneath this incredible Vine you know the IAS you know it was so beautiful for to say that is the only one the the only one where really we saw a forest of aaska we were so blessed that and it was a for ofka mature plants who knows how many generations there we need to respect that that places we need to create sanctu s touch don't touch that plants because they deserve their yes they do they definitely do so I know you've seen plants work many miracles and you've actually shared with us many but I'm just wondering if you maybe have one or two stories to tell of of you know a time when you saw plants just do an amazing I call it plant witnessing you know when we just tell the stories how the plants healed either ourselves or someone so I just was wondering if you might share one of those stories with us I will say that probably one of the of the big moments in my life is when we went with Cascade did you remember the first trip to to the Pacific region to to the CH community and the Healer called yes and he I I didn't know Cascade at period and the next day Cascade called me early in the morning she was waiting there and she said Rosio the the kurand the the shaman talk to you and I say nothing because I was I I didn't know the person I feel so embarrassed to talk about that the plants and and I say why did you ask me that and she said because I have some situations and now I woke up and I didn't have pain in my body and that was the miracle of the limpia ceremony that we have the night before with the kurand so uh the ceremony is so important in different processes when we are using plants could be the limpia like in that case using the plants and doing the limpia or could be a bathing because I love bathing with the bundle of plants and you immerse in that I say in that soup of plants well all the energies of the plants are going into the body and allow you to relax you have the five senses always uh receiving the benefit to to and they will bring into the body to the tactile when all the the the molecul of the plants the combination touching your body it is a special sensation when the aroma you say oh my God so the aroma is bringing into the lyic lyic system into the brain that Aroma of the plants and you can feel maybe it's like I am in the in the forest but it's not it's just B of plants and when they temperature of the plants result of the of the of the fire because we we boil all of that the temperature exactly for my skin for my organs for my needs so I love the combination of plants it's not only one it's the combination and especially with the aromatic plants like th oh my God I feel like a chicken when I'm going into into the th water with the with the all this um mint family the mint family the means with the time how body is not going to feel uh um renew you you forget the worries you are not no you just chill out so we need to do that during the post-pandemic drama during our all our problems all of us we are living some difficult situations in life all of us but with a combination of plants so time is one of my beautiful lovely friend during a baby a baby you know since you were just speaking about the olympias and the bathing I want to ask you a little bit more about those but I wanted I wanted to share an remarkable healing story since you mentioned that as that that I saw the plants and you work miracles I actually have several stories of you I actually have witness um you and the plants you know really just literally working miracles but this is actually with Robert my husband who I you're also very very close friends with and Robert worked for a number of years in Ecuador with you but Robert had made a trip to Morocco and when he was in Morocco he had a really shocking experience he actually has a phobia with snakes and he was was kind of um Charmed by a uh a snake charmer there they kind of wrapped the cobras around him and he really went into shock from that he was totally scared and they wouldn't stop anyway he got right after that experience in the market in marach he got severely ill now Robert really always had a iron stomach right as you know he could just eat anything off the streets of Ecuador youd telling him don't eat that you know just eat the food we repar he would go to the stands and buy anything but after that experience with the cobras in America she began to have terrible stomach problems and so he came home from that I just treated him with my herbs I thought it would go away and months went by and it didn't get better and then so I sent him to a naturopath a naturopathic doctor and they treated him for months and it didn't get better and then he went to a medical doctor we were beginning to be concerned something major was going on the medical doctor did all the tests couldn't see anything but then recommended a really terrible drug that had terrible side effects so Robert just said I'm not going to do that and it was a couple years had gone by and then you came to visit it was after one of the events and you were at our house and Robert asked he explained to you what was going on I probably asked right and then you know and you went and talked to Robert and said yes he loves you and he really trusts you so you had Robert strip down and get in our bathtub and you did a gave them an herbal bath and then you made lympia you went out to our garden which was such a great testc a great lesson because I know that in the jungle in your Homeland you have certain plants that you work with but you learned that anywhere those you just go out and talk to the plants and you the plants you know you pray to them and they kind of tell you which ones to use you came back with a bundle of aromatics from our garden and you just I remember you in there in that in that tub for about 20 minutes you know you're standing over Robert beating him with this limpia you know and chanting and singing and and then when you were done the water in the tub was black it was just terrible and and then you had him take the limpia this bundle it's a bundle of Earth herbs that you would gather and they were they also were kind of black they'd all turned from their beautiful colors to this kind of dark energy and they all looked really welted and you had him go out in the forest and then toss it behind his back into the forest when we used to do that work with you and in Ecuador you would always have us go to the waters you know and toss it into the waters but we didn't have a stream and then really the next day Robert woke up and that was pretty much the end of the stomach problem that had been bothering him for over two years um and so and I you know I have to say it wasn't like I was surprised I because I have I believe in this work and I also believe in in the ability to to to work through the plants right but I also was delighted because you know he could now eat again and be so anyway and there are other stories too but I just I wanted to share that so I was just wondering can you share a little bit more about the limpias with our listeners like um and and I know that they come I know that we see limpas being used in very many different cultures around the world you know using plants um my my teacher Juliet de barley Ley who was from she was Egyptian and Turkish descent she called it the laye on of leaves that's that was her D gather the plants up and she would do a little like a little bit of the you know washing or brushing of the body and then she would lay the leaves on and then clean them off so different different cultures have different ways of doing it but would you just share a little bit with us about the olympias yes uh the same in my country the limpia really I'm thinking and the limpia is one of the first experience in my life when I was a child always always we have the limpia uh coming back from different places especially from the school or different events and until we understood that limpia is like a a first um emergency support H to remove forces to remove What Now call vibrations and science is showing that heart can feel vibrations and humans can absorb vibrations with different instruments you can detect now even with the in the brain if they put some elements and people can can see the changes into the brain when the vibrations are affecting to the body and just I love because science is verifying what what we what the elders they were yeah discovering for who know thousand of years ago so with the limpia the main the main point is to collect aromatic plants and like you you have a fantastic garden and I fell in love with your garden because you have this collection of aromatic plants so I say whatever is happening here Ros has the most fantastic plants to make limpia or to make a py baby it's these aromatic blands and why aromatic because the aromatic put put us in the now is in fashion the now you are not thinking in the past or in the future the now because when we are doing this shaking in the body of the person with the plants what you are doing is first you are in the tactile with the skin with the main organ of the of the body and removing removing bacterias because the aromati has essential oils and removing elements because we are a a community of bacterias and some bacteria can move from one bodies to anothers with different vibrations and bring us sometimes ah feeling tired feeling no good so the aromatic plants can make the change the other to the lyic system when we smell and going that aroma breae us to the now and say I want to to smell more this beautiful this beautiful and sometimes we are biting pieces when we are doing we invite the person okay time or different different means and that produce saliva when you are chewing it's a you produce more fluids in the body more saliva and moisturizing the body in inside and the sounds when you are doing the limpia you produce sounds sounds and you sing a said a special mans and that release the forces so it if we explain in that way people can understand easily why the limpia is so important and why the aromatic plants I'm not going to do the limpia with such a no beautiful Aroma no because in the lympia you need to bring that person in such a no good condition to a special a special moment where it's possible to increase the strength of spiritual immune system and in that moment the person can leave the condition so limpia is quite a strong important ceremony for in all my country in all that's a beautiful explanation you know when I was listening to you it just made me a conscious I wanted to ask you about this it's like you know we're all seeking to become more aware of the differences between cult cultural appropriation versus cultural appreciation and can you share with us how you feel the two differ and how we can appreciate and use the teachings you share so generously without appropriating them because I know that it's something we're all trying to understand better and to be more respectful and responsible for and yet throughout history people have shared these teachings you know they you around the world people uh especially healers always been so generous so if you would just share your your sites or your thoughts and feelings about that I think that there are there is a big differences between the appropriation when people is leading processes without recognition of the of the cultures because cultures produce it's not like I'm doing address and everybody can use the address because we need address we we need to feel warm and to feel happy or beauty whatever reason is there yes it's okay but when to put a sticker in that in that and say this is coming from the tribes from this Kuro the shaman because it's not my it's not my my style it's not my my dress it's not my recipe it's the recipe of that people who keep and save the knowledge for the generations and this is the typical example what is happening now with yaasa with yaasa I can see you I ask many many of the people who are taking drinking aaska which is okay it's okay I I don't mind that it's okay but I asked some of them especially even some very close friends I said did you ask to the person who who is offering the aaska no we went to the market and and the the guide vot in the market the the medicine I say I how is possible that that is is happening it's so danger and I ask what what is the combination you need to ask what is the combination how how is the process because that is the recognition of the intellectual property when I ask and say is coming from where what type of combinations will be suitable for for my body different questions that allowed the owners of that knowledge or that technique of that ceremony to put in in the in the same level than the person that is drinking to make an exchange of the spiritual and physical benefit but if I can see like I see now and I'm not judging but this everybody's taking one single yeah type of preparation globalization I call the globalization of theka what is happening with the globalization we are losing the knowled the local knowledge we are losing the local knowledge that incredible wisdom why because the local people they want to prepare only that beverage because that called The Tourist people what is happening for me I am so happy because always I was rting I don't know we have different varieties of aaska and that was my theory for many many years and different levels of knowledge of theas is not only for ceremonies different levels different levels we have a meeting in in the University San Marcos in in Peru they invite me we I was learning a lot and I was so happy you know why because at least in Peru 16 different oh my goodness species of aaska 16 I wonder how people and what type of aaska I'm talking about only the one species is taking and in Ecuador we don't know and I'm open to do the research because I want to do with my daughter because she's she's ethnopharmacologist too to to know what how many varieties how many species that is the tiure for the planet so that is the G that is the intellectual property and if we go only for this and drink thinking this and it's a typical answer oh yes I'm talking AA with chuna chuna changrun is a name from Peru and all my friends the young Generations long time ago now I'm going and they say and this is a typical story Rosary that fit perfectly well with your question I I went to to my center and the guy who managed the Cano he's married with a a woman that now they they don't use Kuro oacha which is the name local names for the shaman and and he say Rio you know that now my wife is you will say a female Shaman yes but now she say is a shamana which is a female and I was laughing I was what did you say and she said shamana because I am a shaman oh shamana how the worlds are changing and and I say we are not going to lose knowledge you need to offer what you know what you know what is your root what is the wisdom and that is in one side that okay and then and he say and I want to learn the word that the the people use now and I say what is the word and he say changuna and he say excuse me I don't know what is that I know but I say excuse me I don't know and I say what is the name inan in kicha in kicha he in in in in the Amazonian and he said no that is all now the people don't don't know that so we are losing the the Integrity the intellectual property we are losing and we are imposed yeah for the movement in the market so we need to be careful in that way we need to respect and ask always what species will be suitable for me what what is my goal when I dream this could be a Mor curiosity is perfect could be I have some heal situation find a good Kuro could be for tourist activity it's okay but always yeah respect the that's a beautiful answer Rosie I can see you're very impassioned by it too you know just very very I'm so glad I asked because it's it's an important question that we all need to be asking you know and really seeking answers for yeah I just have to say every time I speak with with you I just I it's what you say but it's also what I feel when what you what with what you say you know I think as I mentioned earlier you channels so much information but so much heart as well so our time is almost up but I I wanted you to share with our listeners like some of the classes and some of the teachings that you're doing both not just in the Ammon Center I know that you travel around really many parts of the world and offer courses and classes so would you just share so that that way um people will and then we can let people know on our website how to get in touch with you we'll put a link up here as well but um would you just share what's coming up and what you'll be doing this year well this year uh soon Monday I'm going to my lovely country after the post-pandemic drama and other situations but I I'm ready to open the winds and ready to meet with the forest in the jungle
