i don't think that we are original formulators of really anything that has to do with herbs i think it's something that travels through us it's part of our ancestors teachings if we stand in the right place with our hearts open our minds ready oftentimes this information moves through us in service to be passed out sometimes our ego likes to claim it you know i like to say oh this is one of my formulas because it makes me feel good for a little while but in truth i know i'm always reminded by my ancestors they always tap on me and say you claim that information too deeply and it goes elsewhere so it's part of that teaching you know you just let it flow in you accept it you share it and then you let it flow back out and it becomes part of that grade underground stream river really that's circling around this world nourishing all of us young green beans not beans but beans
