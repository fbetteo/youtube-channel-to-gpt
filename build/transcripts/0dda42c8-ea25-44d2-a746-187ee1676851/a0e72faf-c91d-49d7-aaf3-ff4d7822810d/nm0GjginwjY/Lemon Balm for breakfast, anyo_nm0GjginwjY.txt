this is lemon balm melissa officinalis one of the most revered and most highly prized of the whole mint family just for the aroma it's beautiful it also has a delicious flavor i've never met anybody who didn't like the taste of lemon balm it's very very comforting and refreshing it's very relaxing it's very embracing to the nervous system it's very calming but it's also energizing it opens up your nervous system when we're calm and relaxed we tend to have more energy and really i think in our culture we need to focus more on relaxing nervins than we do on the stimulating we'd have a lot less angry people on the freeway i always imagine in the morning time if you were in rush hour traffic and everybody was on lemon balm instead of coffee i think we'd have a much friendlier population instead of honking and screaming and giving each other the finger they'd be waving they'd be giving the five finger salute maybe the 10th finger happiness
