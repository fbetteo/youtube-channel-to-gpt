hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant and healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders pass on as we're all destined to [Music] do I can feel the I know that I'm part of when I see the I am thankful to be here I am thankful my esteemed guest today is David Hoffman he has definitely been a person who has influenced and inspired me and thousands of other herbalists and plant lovers worldwide a fellow of Britain's National Institute of medical herbalism David has been a phyo therapist for 45 years after moving to the United States in 1986 David became the director of my almaat the California school of Global Studies and he's still a faculty member there David is a founding member and also was founding president of the American herbalist Guild in 2004 he joined the team at traditional medicinals and became their Chief formulator and later served as their principal scientists David is the author of 14 books which have been translated into nine languages with another one I hear on its way he's a hugely popular teacher at Earth schools academic institutions and conferences actually around the world and activist his whole life David ran for parliament in the UK for the green party in 1983 and he remains active in environmental and political issues and there's so much more to say about David you can read David's full bio on our website and also find links to his books um and just David I want to say thank you for joining me I I always look forward to our conversations and you know you always you always have inspired me and just taken me off to places of new beginnings new ways of thinking and I know you've done that for so many others so thank you thank you for being here today well thank you I I just need to say something immediately based on on what you said I realized recently at no point did I move to America you know I've got a green card I live here I'm legal don't tell Trump everything's fine but what I moved to was the herbal Renaissance what I moved to was the green herbal Community which is was totally lacking in Europe so I moved to your family if you see what I mean and secondarily I had to get American paperwork but the moving to America was completely secondary I moving over here was a dive into real herbalism as opposed to clinical herbalism which is what I was doing doing in England so um thank you for getting me over here really thank you well I remember actually when we first started having those conversations which were probably through letters and you said you were moving to California I was like beside myself because I had read that first book that you published the holistic herbal which was actually revolutionary it's kind of funny to think that that really because there's been so many incredible books that have come out many that you've written but that first book really had an amazing influence um because it tied the whole concept of Gaia and holistic healing into the field of verbalism um and I don't know if you aware of that but I've always been curious you know what inspired you to write that book that was back in 1983 for God's sake 84 84 um there were two two core issues going on one was you know my background my my birthing into being green so to speak was from an environmental perspective not from a herbal medicine perspective what really drew me into um the Deep Embrace with Gia was um recognition that we needed to be responsible for our relationship with her and her with us um so I was exploring all sorts of ways to um Shed off my englishness my conditioned europeanness all of that stuff um and then not secondarily but following that I was really drawn to herbalism for a number of reasons but then I realized it was no way other people would get the connection which was obvious to me if you're an environmentalist deeply environmental you're a herbalist you might not recognize that but it's it's in there it's just a given and then the books that I was having to study at herbal Medical School were abysmal The herbal facts were good but they were written by oldtime herbalists who it's amazing they could spell let alone anything else wonderful healers but not the best communicators so um I had a a combination of really wanting to share the green that was moving me and then trying to save my new students from the crap I had to go through with the old books so yeah that book has been um it writing the book and then seeing what effect it's had completely transformed my life so I've I've written a number of books but there are only three books that I think are worth reading one is that one which was 40 years ago next year then medical herbalism which is the medical textbook which is 20 years ago next year and then my new book which is coming out next year um which is putting green environmentalist orientated herbalism in a very political context very very political it's it's not a howto book it's a oh God we've messed up this is what we have to contribute as herbalists and there is a lot for us to contribute um so that that 20 year cycle seem to really have have been important to me the German version is three times as big and also the Greek version three times as big as my book as it's the English book and PE the Publishers kept saying well the Germans use longer words but I've always wanted to have someone translate the German one to just see if is it really my book it's just too long but still that's pretty fascinating yeah you know it isn't amazing it's a small book it you know and today when we look back at it we'd wonder the influence it definitely had an impact it's still one of the books I recommend always to my beginner students you know because of just the way it introduced Concepts that was brilliant and I would say the all of your books are but you're right about that cycle the medical herbalist one has been just such an influence especially with practitioners you know people as they dve a little deeper you know I don't know if you've ever heard this but I have heard that first book has been um related it to sort of as the uh permaculture for the body the holistic herbal have you ever heard that no but that's that's wonderful I know yeah the book it's a permaculture the body with my sense of humor I I need to look at where the um oh no I'm thinking of anthroposophy all the all the amendments to the soil we have to put in do I do I need new bath treatments maybe I do no no I think it was they were talking about just how everything is so interconnected and that's what you did so beautifully in that book you it wasn't just a book that had remedies for illnesses it was the interconnection so I thought I was like oh my God that does explain it perfectly well a books that actually triggered me to think I could write a book um because my old English teachers thought I was illiterate but the book that triggered me was Hyer um by Janine pavarti that book really changed my world view I disagreed with a bunch of her herbalism but so what her her world view and that fundamentally gay and feminist perspective um really transformed me that was one of the great Classics I'm so sorry it's out of print you know Janine was such a power powerful she was like a goddess so many people don't read that book anymore and I agree with you it is such a it's idea by Janine perardi nin a really great one thank you for mentioning her books you know they're kind of sometimes those great old classics are kind of getting forgotten and I still believe I love a lot of the new books that are coming out but some of those Classics that were written in the 1970s and 80s are just Powers they're powerhouses of information well not so much information just as a way like you were saying a way of viewing the world a world view you know that we actually need to revitalize right now I agree so fully I think we're having a little bit of a backlash here you know little bit of that belated so we're talking across the country so it's a lot of miles but I did want to ask you um I always love hearing the stories of those kind of AA moments when the plants just kind of grab us you know we it's like they for some people it's like they come along and they kind of save us and not necessarily physically but even on a spiritual and emotional level and I'm sure you have a story like that I do I do the the core one was just me getting one day that I was being embraced by the environment you know core hippie insights that we belong in the planet but the real aha moment actually happened in 1974 or 75 there had this is a weird story um I had graduated from University as as an ecologist and with the all the conditioning that you get in in botany schools um I wasn't interested in herbalism because I had a degree I knew more than these oldtime herbalist all all the con conditioning then there was this um Heatwave in in England uh Heatwave means it was 75 degrees for a week you know we were wimps but the plants were dying it wasn't raining and nothing was getting on well and I hadn't slept for about 5 days because of the heat the people in my community because you know good hippies we were all in this community I was totally pissing them off lack of sleep you know I just wasn't pleasant and basically they forced me to drink a cup of valarian tea now Not only was I a botanist so I knew better than them and I was really resistant to it this was really wasn't fresh Valerian it was all dry Valerian so the taste and the smell was terrible and they forced me to drink it there's about five of them standing around me making me drink this thing um and then I had the best night sleep I remember ever having I slept for about 18 hours and woke up renewed and refreshed and all that wonderful stuff um and I got it my my environmentalist I'm going to try and do this with my hands um imagine a let's get this right imagine a circle as an environmentalist I was healing part of friends of the earth we were going to heal the planet suddenly the planet had healed me oh so it wasn't us doing it it did me and so fine suddenly everything was a cycle it all made sense um so that just not just changed my physical body it changed my expectations of how I could be in the world because nature loved me even though it tasted bad nature loved me um and every everything went from there so it totally reinforced my doubts about the system doubts about experts this was a bunch of Dum hippers making me drink tea and it was healing totally transforming um there was definitely an AA moment that's profound I love that story so much you know I always feel with valan it's such a trickster for people you know it's it's kind of one of those um tic it does either or you know it either for most people it's really relaxing for some people it's not some people really love the taste and the smell most people don't you know it has these really you know I always taught you have to religiously Infuse it never boil it but I know lots of people who boil it it works just fine it's just such a trickster in how it teaches us have you tried to make tea or medicine out of the freshly dug up Roots because they're delicious yeah it's like the the aroma and the taste just soon as it starts drying it it gets weird but it tastes like like violets when you first uh when you first dig it out of the earth it smells tastes like violets very much so yeah yeah yeah David I read something you wrote recently and I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little more on it um it said after being a clinical phytotherapy forever I now have finally discovered the garden and I'm actually an herbalist yes um when it comes to the Garden I don't want to say I'm a good herbalist but for most of my life you know I grew up in London um was a scientist was a you know all all of that stuff gardening I always felt too big and lumpy to be in the garden I I wasn't really respecting the plants so um you know in gardens I always did the physical work I always felt resistant about actually planting anything because who did I think I was um I just you know wasn't part of their family now I am I I really feel feel it and my relationship with the herbs has got nothing to do with what I can do with them that's a completely separate thing my relationship is is cellular it it's um it is very difficult to talk about so that people who get what I mean get what I mean people who don't get what I mean I'm never going to be able to communicate it so it doesn't sound like hippie Airy Fair because it is really we're part of this miraculous wonderful green loving thing that my human family is rapidly destroying I as part of that family and stop that destruction but because the reason I'm going to do that is because the herbs love me and it's enabled me to discover my love for them it's it's really it's very simple stuff when it comes down to it the more we think about it the more we mess it up um but I reached a point where I can be simple about it without judging myself for not using my academic training you see what I mean oh God yeah that just moves me actually I have tears in my eyes listening to you David because it it's just yeah it's really the journey you know we sometimes think that we're saving the Planet are saving plants but it's really the herbs saving us the plants are saving the earth I think just by their nature of being there's a problem that we all have over here when it comes to looking at European herbalism it gets look and therefore my herbalism and my background it get gets looked at through an American perspective which is irrelevant to European herbalism so let me try and put some context in here there were no old real herbalists in England I never met a real herbalist in England they that was all historical um yeah was historical stuff we we had their books and I knew a few people who had known Mrs geve but they weren't herbalists they just had known her so my training was um not with a herbalist in their Garden or in their medicine making room or in their Clinic it was in um the hides Medical Clinic in Leicester four stories of clinical rooms with um I think it was about 15 different herbalists well-trained herbalists and the whole organization had a six-month waiting list so for me my introduction to herbalis with sort of conveyor belt medicine medicinal herbalism yeah so it was all about ures and efficiency and healing and well sorry removal of disease not healing um and it's very efficient at that and I I became good at it um I am a good practitioner but that doesn't make me a herbalist makes me a practitioner and um I totally understand American herbalists wanting to be good practitioners of course yeah but the more you do that the more the herbalism Slips Away the more the heart connection with with whatever we have hard connection with the more tenuous it gets um The More We Get coopted By evidenc driven medicine which is very important all that stuff is very important and it's irrelevant to being a herbalist we have to be able to juggle both things together and after 45 years of doing that I've been I've reached a point where I can juggle in my own life those two things it might look like crazy chaos from somebody observing me but I'm having a really good time now took a long time but that's incredible and very powerful yeah it makes me just think as I said when every time I chat with you it always takes me deeper you know it just helps me understand you know my whole background as an nalist has always been I I was born and raised in California right sort of landed in the middle of that whole yeah incable hippie movement and and also like how herbalism arose in in the United States was more from a very ground up way you know it was not coming from a professional way so much as it was coming from just people yeah like trying to get back to the land so we were gardening in organic foods and then that included self-care and taking care of us and we and there was a still a lot of we didn't need permission to do what we did like nobody gave Janine permission to to be wonderful nobody gave me permission to be holistic unfortunately that doesn't happen too much anymore people need inform before they step out of their comfort zone and you and I part a lot of what we do when we're on the road is give people permission it's that simple I I remember once in one class somewhere on in the Midwest Midwest in in the early 90s a woman came up after we'd finished tears in her eyes and I thought I'd really offended her and i' done something wrong um but what I had done was talk about tree hugging I just had affirmed that I'm a tree hugger and we should all be doing stuff like that the first time she had heard anybody say that and she told me the story about going out into a garden at 2:00 in the morning where no one was about hugging trees to ground herself and do all the stuff that you know we all do when we hugging trees but I was the first person who'd mentioned it the fact that I was the first person was on one level really sad but thank God I was there to do it because people who end up going into their Gardens at 2:00 in the morning um their life is not comfortable if they can't do that at 5:00 in the afternoon yeah if that makes sense that makes such total sense do you remember Grandpa Roberts at herb school he was a he always took all of the students out you know the Elder you take them all out and his M teaching was getting all the students the hug trees of course with all of those younger people it was already kind of instilled in there right but yeah he was it was just beautiful we'd always look up on the side of the hill and everybody'd be up there hugging the trees yeah David you know I wanted to ask you I know that you've I know he is really a wonderful wonderful old guy for certain you know that was also another thing I think in the United States there was still Elders you know when we were just beginning our work with Clans we still had Elders that we could learn from and we had so much love and respect for these elders but I'm just wondering is there a teacher or teacher who's really influence your work not phyto therapeutically not in terms of me learning the art and the Craft um that was from European herbalism yes and there are some name teachers but they wouldn't mean anything over here they they weren't our sort of teacher they they were Educators and I have to say I've learned um in terms of people being guides and all of that I've I've got most out of just being with American women herbalists not not in any sexual way not nothing to do with that but just actually really seeing and feeling what um the yin is about what the feminine Embrace of Gia and Gia Embrace Embrace of the feminine is about and that doesn't happen to men unless we open ourselves to doing being like that and it's really difficult for men in this culture we all know how women are oppressed by the patriarchy I could go on for days about how men are oppressed by the patriarchy yeah um yeah you know the patriarchy affirming men as the warrior I mean we should be ashamed of ourselves so what I have really been educated and unfolded by is um the smile on a beginning herbalist a woman's herbalist face as she first makes her first tincture that easy open smiling loving Embrace of it all is part of what makes me who I am and I've learned that from you and your students you and your family put it that way you and your family that's very unique to North America and maybe also New Zealand to in the English speaking world one of the other things that I think is really unique to American herbalism is the hands oness of it um yeah when I first came over here seeing all the varieties of medicines that were made and the varieties I still have have this memory of you trying to get me to um henah my hair every week through a couple of class sessions um just in England that didn't happen because of history and you know stuff so the actual art of herbalism was really rediscovered and redeveloped by your generation of American herbalists because you had some role models to get it from yeah it's so true that's really fascinating yeah I remember trying to get you to hen of your hair you're one of the few people I never could get to do it well what can I say you know I know the queen wouldn't have liked it the queen oh she might have loved it David oh not on me no no what do you think happened in the United States that that just started the trajectory that it did like what do you think it was those early Gatherings or that just started American urbanism in that direction I don't know other than Wilderness um when I first touched into the west of the US I was beyond blown away you know or I've seen it in in movies but when I was getting lost in in Arizona and New Mexico that again transformed me America is one of the few places was one of the few places where Wilderness left even that Wilderness is going now no it's tame Wilderness but when when I first came over here in the 80s you could be in the wilderness and herbalism gets nurtured by wildness yeah I agree with you I think the Wilderness did have a huge impact on it and also I think it was also the timing you know because you like in the 1960s what was going on astrologically you know was there was such huge amounts of changes that was just embracing that younger generation of which we were a part yeah it's almost like we didn't have a choice that you know we did but it was almost like we were being led in the direction we were back to the land you know wanting things to be more natural it wasn't like choices that we made really it was more like a calling you know like and right and it was wide what made American herbalism grow in in all of that stuff you were you were just hinting at was the unique environment here um the plants were really ready to um to dance with you all um when I was in my early herbal years in England it was it was illegal to pick a flower because it the flower was the reproductive part of the plant is there a particular instance that you recall when you saw plants were killing miracles on you or someone else yeah I actually hardcore Miracles I have to say um so this is me the doctor talking and we should never talk about miracle cures because that's not what it's about um but we can have transformatory body responses and then never Miracles well miracles happen yes but that's not this might sound miraculous but it's not um it relates to a woman that was was in a wheelchair um with rheumatoid arthritis um and really bad really extreme situations and what I saw happen was what in America would would be called a healing crisis and that those terms weren't used in England um when the body is ready to heal it will use anything it can that's offered it offered to it to heal itself with and it's not so much the thing that heals you it's the body using the thing to heal itself so I am not saying anything about my combination for rheumatoid arthritis even though it's a good one and it will alleviate a bunch of the symptoms but what happened with her was classic um it was mild medicine because with rheumatoid arthritis you got to make sure the stomach is not going to react to anything because of the drugs they may have been given so it wasn't a real irritating alterative mixture it's it's a basic mixture two days later she had an incredibly high fever which had not been going on at all was in a lot of pain and that was a weekend so I basically I did my herbal version of T aspirins and I'll talk to you in the morning and I was freaked out you know what had I done luckily on the Monday of Tuesday Not only was the fever gone she was out of the wheelchair and she was very stiff but everything had reversed and she was in this wonderful improved state for a good few months afterwards and that then you know we have more to do but it really brought home to me that herbs can do incredible things but they don't do them to the body they do them with the body so I I have never tried to invoke a healing crisis they're real things but it's not for me to decide when the body wants to do that this woman's body was ready and it did it and ready I I was speechless for a week I didn't I was almost in a state where I didn't want to see patience because I didn't know what I was going to do wrong this time if you see what I mean um it it was it was a really humbling experience and an affirmative experience it got me very humble about me and my skills but very positive about herbs and what they could do um really recognizing that quite often the more clinically confident I could be the more I got in the way of the the herbs being miraculous with the patient oh do you mind talking about that a little bit more that's powerful our Western model or the Chinese model or the iic model is a model it it gives you guidelines it gives you structures it gives you interpretive models um and the body isn't like that the soul isn't like that the chakras aren't like that anything that humans can articulate coherently is not not true it's just a way of us trying to grasp the ungraspable so the better I became as being a phyto therapist the more I was willing to throw it all away because the healing process is not about logic it's about the body doing what it needs to do when it's time for it to do it the value of the phyto theapy and all the science is to make sure um that I can actually open my therapeutic space safely I know what drugs they're taking I know what the side effects or what the complications might be I I study all of that but that doesn't mean that that's all I can do they they're the constraints within which I can ignore the constraints so I would never use potential dangerous herbs but yeah I think you know you know where I'm going I really do think the simpler the herb the more um well the more nettle like the more chamomile like the more whorn like the more powerful it is I'm a bit concerned about how us herbalism is really diving into adaptogens adaptogens are totally crucial and important the insight about their need is not let's Asanda the Insight is let's change our lifestyle so we're not as stressed um using herbalism to make our place in 21st century culture more comfortable is an abuse of herbalism we need to get rid of 21st century culture then we probably wouldn't be stressed so I'm getting a bit too political there but that's quotable I've got to you know like I just want to write down all these quotes that one is incredibly quotable right there I did agree with you totally well oh you know I heard you mentioning nettle and I just you know you are very quotable and I see quotes that you've said all over the place but that one is probably your most famous quote you know when in doubt use nettle and the older I get them I'm the more I agree with it but when that when I first said that which was in a in the school room at at California school we were in the middle of a totally knotted up discussion about how you choose what alternative is right should you use a rooty one a leafy one an irritating one it it got really really mental and intense and miss the point and I just got rid of the whole conversation by saying when in doubt use Nettles as an alternative the alternative Parts been dropped um by most people definitely there are situations where you don't want to use Nettles but then you wouldn't be owed you would know so um considering some of the other things I've said in my life that's probably the safest one to be known for well even the story of how of what you said and when and how has changed I think in part for me because I always I always tell the story of you being at the international herb Symposium and doing this incredible lecture on you know that was a chemical constituents and the counter indications and of using them with drugs and then at the very end I would you know I make it very dramatic you lead into the podium and and your students are heads are all whirling with all this information and you go when in doubt use nettle and then I realized when I heard you tell the real story when you first said that I have the whole story mixed up but my story is pretty good too oh yeah yeah I I really want to get over to students and in in conferences that the the knowledge and and the ever exponentially growing body of knowledge that we expect ourselves to know is only of relevance in that it can give the Mind something to chew over so that our spirit and intuition and connection can point us to the plant and the people who need to hear that are the people at the symposiums because you know if you want to get lost in brain stuff we can do that can definitely do that yeah so while we're talking about nettle and chamomile and some of those other wonderful herbs that you mentioned we all have special plants that we hold really close to our hearts and so I was wondering who are your plant allies if you don't mind sharing are there any special plants that you just are always there for you and yes um Nettles definitely hathorne definitely and then I have to say it's whatever is growing in front of me when when I W I've done a lot of world traveling and you and I have done a bit together in in Greece and so on um what I what I got out of all of that is that I'm at home wherever the grass is growing and it may be grass I've never seen before um it may be completely new but if if the green is nurtured and is there that's my Ally that's what keeps me together when it comes to specific things for health issues I know too much to be able to do that so I go for what I logically know um and actually skull cap so if we had if I just had skull cap hathorne and nettles um I I I'd be fine I really would why skull cap David it works really well on my personal form of anxiety and mentalness um and all right here's here's a story um when I was first in clinical practice my community in Wales for some reason we were in one of those phases where other than me there were no men in the community um not that I was in a relationship with the a women and a variable number of children I I could never work that out it seemed to come and go but one of the things about when you have that number of women living closely together in an intentional Community menstruation all harmonizes it really does which means yeah premenstrual tension or P menstrual syndrome whatever you choose to call it that harmonizes so seven women moving into PMS at the same time and the very first sign of PMS is denial of PMS starting as a man I know that I recognized it in them and you know I have to keep quiet in those situations I found over a few months I tried all sorts of different herbs from the books that were hinted out as things that would help PMS skull cap not very good skull cap dried skull cap from Potters not not grown locally every single time with every woman in the community it would alleviate that side of of their lives not to get rid of the PMS but the PMS changed from crinkly electric shock weirdness to oh wow I'm having a really good time so it was doing something the energy was still there but it became positive so I just got that skull cap was one of my personal doorways into recognizing the feminine and wow it's it's just been an Ali like that ever since male herbalists have really got to look carefully at the way we men in the herb World um even though we think of ourselves as being open and feminist and all of that stuff we're just as bad as any other group of men so um I put a lot of attention on how skull cap can help me in in that place and this is not Chinese skull cap by the way just ordinary American and European skull Camp yeah that's beautiful I know I I use skull cap and I love it you know mostly I find it's really good for anxiety of the brain you know for people whose Minds just kind of keep going round and round and round it just seems to really calm that and take that and I know that it's a very popular herb you know in among many herbalists but yeah it's not one that I've used a lot you know I know I should because it's I know I should I should get to know it better because no it's it's one of my so when I use it with people it works well because it's one of my allies there are other herbs which I hear other people get really good results with I get reasonable results but because they're not my allies my spirit isn't in the medicine or isn't in the recommendation um with Nettles and skull cap and horon I'm there that's so beautiful so it you're really stating in that it has so much to do with the relationship between you the herbalist and the person who you might be suggesting here to that's a really important part of that whole healing try yeah that's beautiful so David I want to ask you you know there we see this incredible growing interest I think it's gone beyond the Renaissance that we used to talk about you know just herbalism has become you know and so you know we we had challenges when we were first starting our herb work for certain they're very different than what herbalists are facing now what do you see as some of the challenges for this generation of herbalist who are just rising up now there are many um the one that comes to mind In This Moment which may be a different one half an hour from now is that most of I I was just in a meeting just before this where we were talking about the new students at her school California school and listening to all the other faculty talk I realized they're all thinking about future jobs employability um how they fit into this or that that was never an issue we were learning herbalism there were no jobs um we created them but there was nowhere to fit in which I thought was really good because you fit in you're lost but now the first thing is where do we fit in not how do we fit in where's my job going to be and I think that's a real problem um not that there aren't jobs the problem is there are jobs herbalism has been I've got to be careful here herbalism is in the process of being corrupted by capitalism toay um the dietary supplement health education act that changed everything back in the 90s what did Shay did was make herbalism safe for capitalism it was possible for the capitalist to make money and um always a bad thing always I'm sorry I'm this is where I don't fit into America at all um I think the big challenge for all of us is how not to become another tool of Oppression uh and here is not you need to buy my new book I know the book is all about yeah um so I don't really want to Sidetrack into that now but we we herbalism needs to be sorry not herbalism herbalists the individual needs to be really clear about how they view their world and what role they they want in their world not looking at the world on what role it's going to give you because all it's going to give you is either the right to wa to make money or the right to owe money and herbalism shouldn't be about money the Nettles growing outside in my garden I'm not paying it the trees aren't demanding exchange of of value I mean the American capitalist world view is is really really unhealthy I challenge all of that and um the younger herbalists the the people just starting to come in they get that they really do Greta thumberg and all those people have created the space for them to recognize it the herbl that I work with in their late 20s and 30s they're really after jobs they're re they're really bought into what you could achieve in the culture um maybe they shouldn't be students of mine um the only value the culture has is it's something to focus on to break down we need to get rid of it we need to celebrate gu celebrate the love not fiddle about trying to see how we can get that love into the cracks between the oppression of the system let's be honest let's come out um yeah I love that TR hug trees all of that stuff it just yeah I thought this conversation brings us right back to where we started back to Gaia you know the holistic herbal because that was that whole message 40 years ago I am really excited about your new book I want to say though I'm going to ask you a little bit more about it I can tell as we're talking that this is going to be the main theme in it but one of the things I've been really wanting you to do David and I was hoping that this would be this book maybe it'll be your next one in 20 years from now but is I want you to write the book about your life because you've had this incredibly fast we're just touching like a tiny bit of your herbal world but there's this entire world that you've lived in and been a part of That's so exciting um I actually have written the preface of the book to try and explain to friends of mine how I got to the weird place weird conclusions in the book which um to me they very positive and very um just very positive to most people who read it they just see it as a dark way of looking at the world the world has become very very dark within that we can heal it there is a bunch of light for us to do but I'm in trying to explain how I got to that place um half of my family died in the concentration camps I grew up in a house with a bomb site behind it from an 800 pound Nazi bomb um it Europe never was comfortable and it probably never will be comfortable my world view it was set up with the experience of they're out to get you whether it be Nazis the police the conservatives whatever so um there is a very strong political streak in me not political for political party but political in terms of we should not be oppressed guia has created created this wonderfully loving supportive environment and yet the people with the guns are still there that's my take on politics um then my father was the Beatles photographer so I grew up in rock and roll and my background is very strange so yeah I'm actually working on an autobiography you are working on your autobiography you are because it keep coming up in in the middle of all these thoughts I I'm actually asking myself how on Earth did you get there and then I kept thinking about it yes all right I know how I got here so the preface of the book is like the beginning of the autobiography so there's going to be some history of me yeah so you know there was a time when just saying just saying that I was a hippie people would understand they don't get that being a hippie back then meant that we were out to change the world heal the planet transform everything so the flowers could grow instead of being trampled on by the tanks um so you know that's where I'm at with that one that's pretty amazing so what's the name of the book and is is it coming out this year um it should have done should have been out this year it'll be out the beginning of next year the current working title and the title is going to be down to the editors um it started out being called herbalism in the 2st century or herbalism for the 21st century and it was going to be a look at how the culture's view of herbalism has become very positive how science has t totally embraced it as opposed to what I experienced way back when medicine has embraced it the Ecology of planetary crisis has got some major insights about the values of herbs so that's still in it and then it was going to move on to the way in which her herbalism and its insights are transforming the culture but when I started working on that point uh that's Stu I realized there was no way I could do this morally there is nothing to save in the culture there are people obviously but the culture yeah is a very negative influence all cultures um we have to reaffirm our indigenous roots with the roots of the trees we've got to get rid of all my englishness all of your americanness all of my jewishness all of your Armenian we've got to be green um so I have to justify that in the book so I then look at the culture as the negative thing it is not the way is positively embracing herbalism the culture is killing the planet and there's enough stuff coming from ecology and all of those Sciences now to really bring home to everybody unless we change our ways there won't be a human culture a 100 years from now doesn't matter what your politics are what you want what you believe doesn't matter it's almost too late the Cycles as such that climate change is climate collapse yes I won't go into that now but read the book um things are much much worse than we want to think even people like me who think this way they're much worse than that so it's time to affirm our herbal radicalness our green radicalness and embrace the plants and do that in public that sounds a bit silly do it in the road be in people faes not as a way of transforming them but just to show we don't need to do your crap anymore you've killed enough people you've killed enough plants profits aren't worth it bullets aren't worth it go away stop it and if they don't listen to us the planet will stop them so we need burn out trying to change anything we've got to nurture ourselves creating the new as we've done done all our lives but yeah anytime well for example anytime they hear of a new group of herbal things and doing really good work and then they tell you their business plan of how they're actually going to make money doing this forget it not interested profit and healing don't go together they cannot go together they're mutually exclusive the only way the planet will be healed is by modern technology pissing off just going away and either we get rid of it or guia will close it down one way or another that was Exquisite oh thank you and I do really look forward to this new book for certain so listen I it's our time is almost up but I just wanted to ask you like I could list and I did I started off by listing a few of your accomplishments mean you've been you've done so much and I think one of the most incredible things you've done for the whole herbal Community is just this incredible sense of radicalness every time I speak to you know always your primary interest is just in the health of the earth you know that's and you TI all of your work like this entire conversation no matter where I steered it you would always bring it back to what's most essential is a healing of the earth I really appreciate that but when you look at your work as an herbalist like you said it's been almost 50 years really that you've been a phytotherapy or plant lover what are the things that you're most proud of what what is it that you feel best about well this will sound really strange one of the things that nurtures me is the fact that I'm not financially successful I have not sold out at no point have I compromised on any of my core heartfelt Soul felt beliefs my accountant and my bank manager would like me to be very different but yeah I always bring it back to the essentials because if we don't we'll be dying sooner than we were going to if we're going to be caring about our children and our grandchildren and the whales children and the Dolphins and the Nettles um we've got to be really feel about our beliefs our beliefs don't start later after we bought our house do you see what I mean money I do and profit are scarily negative which is very difficult for Americans to get because everything is profit here um the fact that I've maintained that in my life um nurtures me at at night that's beautiful baby yeah and actually the other thing is that I don't think I've I've I haven't pissed off anybody too much I think that's really true I can vouch for that I don't think you have is that a good thing I hope so I love you David I'm so grateful that all those many years ago I don't remember how we exchanged that first letter but somehow I knew when you were coming to this country I just had to grab you and bring you to the herb school and what a gift that was for everybody you know for all of us for me personally and then just for American herbalism and so I really want to tell you how grateful I am for everything that you do and you know I'm as proud of you for what you've just said too you know your your success has been in always speaking your truth you know speaking it ongoing never giving up so thank you for that yeah and the school and other the people there send their love they they asked me to send that to you now um do we have time for a minute story about what happened when I came the very first time I'll do it really quickly um um the first night I was staying this was just one I first was passing through um you put me up in what was called the little pod which I'm not not even sure it's still there up the side of the hill and I was being I was still very English and you know there are no toxic plants there are no snakes in England to get to the Pod um I had to move some wood under which was a whole family of scorpions to get into the pod had to step over something where I knew there was a snake underneath and the door didn't close so welcome to Herb school it completely got me out of my English safety of course nothing bad ever happened to me at herb school but just the idea of all these scorpions and yeah all right we were going to be friends that was it this was my home so thank you thank you David yeah yeah I'm so proud and glad to know that you're still there teaching you know still part of that whole wonderful school you know I've just have such great memories of those years there at the herb school so yeah I love you dearly thank you so much [Music] here I am thankful to be here I am thankful to be here [Music] yeah
