hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant and healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do I can feel [Music] the I know that I'm part of the earth when I see the I am thankful to be here I am thank my welcome guest today is my dear friend and fellow herbalist Matthew Wood Matthew has been a practicing herbalist since 1982 he earned his master of science degree from the Scottish School of herbal medicine and has been a longtime active member of the American herbalist Gill Matthew is an extremely popular and beloved teacher who has lectured and taught extensively throughout North America Europe and Australia he is the author of six acclaimed books on herbal medicine in fact his books are considered herbal Classics his worth Earthwise herbal uh series of two volumes and the Book of herbal wisdom are for many herbalists myself included among our most valued and referenced herbal textbooks thank you Matthew for joining us I'm so honored to have you here and just be able to talk to you today yes I'm honored to be here with you and you're quite an author too so during all those years I guess from the 90s to the I don't know from the 80s to the whatever um I always thought of you as the herbal uh mother of Mothership of the whole movement I could always feel your energy kind of keeping us from fighting and stuff and nowadays when herbalists are fighting more uh it's kind of like I know you've retired from the position on the inner plane guarding over all of us so so or else it's just impossible to keep uh everybody in order nowadays oh they're all taking I I feel really comfortable they're taking very good care of themselves we we've done a good work and now now it's time to hand the ship over to them I so yeah my initial my mystical experience was on Rib Mountain in Wisconsin the only mountain in Wisconsin just just about 8,800 feet above sea levels not much but but uh it was Quaker first day school or Sunday school and our teacher Francis Hull was a soil science Professor from the University of Wisconsin and he just was dancing almost jumping from rock to rock I still remember it beautiful sunny day and this feeling just came out of him nature is alive nature is alive and I knew it was true I knew it wasn't it wasn't just some sort of um idea was an actual Attunement to the living nature and when I was 31 I got to go back to Madison to thank him for that and he didn't bad an eyelash he he was humble so he didn't say oh yes I passed that knowledge on to you or something he just said ah yes that was a beautiful day and I told him how that had made me you know form my you know whole life that I was you know wanted to actually spread the living nature nature is alive and then also um and that I was doing that as an herbalist and through herbalism and he said and he sat back and he said uh you have chosen well people crave that connection but they can't get there so you will always be in demand and I was like oh my God I can't believe who but a Quaker Elder would tell you that you'd made a good decision to be an her W that's so amazing what a cre story yeah you know I always think it's interesting Matt because at a time when many authors and lecturers are practicing armchair herbalists who offer theories and opinions based on book learning you have always been an active practitioner of traditional herbal medicine I know personally that you have helped thousands of people you know I've known those people that you've helped and many with very challenging and difficult health problems and while I know you believe in the virtues of many different healing modalities your focus has been on preserving and practicing the tradition of herbal medicine as a descendant from our European Elder ERS and our anglo-american and Native American Heritage is so what set you on that path if you don't mind sharing like you know that made you focus on that it made you aware enough to focus on that oh well when I was two weeks old when I was a week old my dad was unemployed he got a job as a teacher for the Bia Bureau of Indian Affairs and they only had a few positions open and one of them I don't think they were the choice ones but it was a great location so he became a teacher in the one room Schoolhouse on the uh big Cyprus Indian seminal Indian reservation in Florida 50 miles by dirt road I mean a dirt road been only in for two years um to the nearest town yeah in the Everglades and um the English was a second language for everybody even the littlest children and um they had only been in treaty relationship with the US government for 18 years in 1954 so I mean they were like you know really From Another Dimension and you know Indian communities as many people know are empathic so you just kind of live inside a fishbowl of of everybody being related and um also their language doesn't have the syllogism or logic of um of Greek Latin English um and so they just say and that type of language pattern you just say what you experience or you don't say anything as my dad would say if two seminal hadn't met in 20 years and they passed each other on the path they wouldn't say anything unless they had something to to say and and because they had that you know just hon a straightforward so there was that and then behind that you know then the medicine people and stuff uh you know they were small band they didn't really have too much in that way but um you would speak um by word plays by um in archetypes basically which can't be expressed exactly directly um but only in sort of by inference by um because it's a hidden world so so that was so I thought that way and I didn't really realize why or how or what to do with it until I was about 18 19 and I always thought astrology was ridiculous and then oh the Stars can't have any influence on us and then somebody did my chart and um she she totally convinced me and I saw first I saw that um astrology was a language of energy patterns or archetypes and I needed that so much that I dropped out of college and studied astrology and yungi and psychology which actually I concluded was based on astrology I hate to say it but I really think it is and um and the two enrich each other I studied that for two years almost I studied for a year Non-Stop and after a year I could talk to see I couldn't really talk to people up till then I just couldn't say any of my thoughts but the most mundane and after a year I could talk to other astrologers and I thought well this is great but I have to learn how to translate this into English so then I I set about for the next year translating astrological Concepts into English so my I'm always thinking in those those archetypes and translating from that into English so so that was that's my actual education I did go back to school it took me 14 years to get my degree bachelor's and as you say I got my uh master's degree at the the Scottish School of verbal medicine which was accredited by the University of Wales about 2002 or three and um that was worth it because they taught me how to read scientific papers and at least I know how to do that and then um mostly I just read the abstract and skip to the um do you find those scientific papers really valuable to read just out of curiosity no mostly no yeah and um um and also in my last book which you gave a good um uh um nice um back page back side review of um holistic medicine The extracellular Matrix in my introduction I I've went through how just all the ma major voices of medicine are saying that the that you know basically um the media the the medical media is captured by big Pharma that Martha Marsha angel from uh New England Journal of Medicine she said by 2003 she was saying you can't trust anything that the drug company's put out uh John Ian's put out a really important paper about 2002 or three that that medical and even scientific research didn't prove anything 70% of the time because the statistical models weren't wer good enough he was a statistician and then even Richard Horton um editor of the um Lancet still editor of Lancet he said he was shocked he came back from uh uh you can just tell he's in shock and he says I at this conference they said up to 50% of all science is bogus and again the drug company's interfering it's all gotten worse so so um one has to be very careful um I think anything involving Prof is far along of course as as you know there's a lot of nice papers from Pakistan Iran Turkey um Saudi Arabia um on herbal medicine Poland is maybe one of the few European countries still doing a lot Germany's always doing some so there are good herbal papers that are worth knowing sometimes yeah well and they'll be review papers which all the uses yeah so but tradition tradition you know I I love whenever I talk to my fellow herbalists I'm always astounded by the ABS absolute Brilliance and the willingness to think outside the box and always even since young children you know like I think of you and William ler David Hoffman Steven buer and just on and on these Brilliant Minds and just were able to travel and come back with this information you're definitely one of them so here's a kind of simple question but I really always love hearing is is there a defining moment and maybe it was this moment that you spoke about with your professor but when you knew you were going to be an herbalist and were on the plat journey is there is there like kind of a spark that you remember about that time yeah I guess at that time I still didn't know I was going to be an herous I was 10 or 11 he was Sunday school teacher um but when I was 13 I read the teachings of Don Juan by Carlos cada which was so important to our generation it was a sum of 1967 and classically it was given to me all dogar by a guy who was on the run from the Army who was going to Canada I mean this is just typical you know 1967 and uh so I read it and I said oh plants have Consciousness and they're more reliable than humans humans are changing all the time but plants they retain you know after 100 million years they make a a little shift maybe and like Hawthorns and apples split apart 100,00 years AO 100 million years ago that's what I meant not 100,00 and um so um they stay the same for a long time and they're reliable of reference points so right away I would say I was already in the idea which it you know so many people were in our generation then since then of you know plant Attunement I I didn't know how to do it I didn't attune to plants at that time but I um knew that plants that there had to be a way to understand the consciousness of plants and I wasn't really particularly interested in huens because I knew regular plants would have it too so so at age 13 I determined to be an herbalist yeah yeah and at age 17 I started that's when I first actually got some her books I believe actually my dad got them it's kind of like you know parents sometimes they tune into what their kids are doing and then so they study and then they pass it on and uh so good and one of my first heres my first one of my favorite still is a Ben Charles Harris the complete herbal yeah yes me too yeah yeah I always regretted that that we weren't that he didn't come that he maybe didn't live long enough to come to any of our conferences of the younger generation I don't really know but he was in Massachusetts so yeah I mean we did try to gather up as many of the elders as we could um but I think that he was like back that would have been like the 1980 I think he might have been either quite elderly or maybe just on the other side of the country so I never had the chance to meet him but I love some of those old classic her books you know I'm so glad to hear you met so good I love that your father was so and he would actually get you her books well he got him for himself but see now I realized that he was actually tuning into what I was tuning into yeah and it was an interest for him for a couple years now now then now he's still alive and my mom at 90 3 and 92 and they attribute their uh still being alive to following my herbal and homeopathic um uh path and um they pay attention to the doctors much more than um that nowadays but that's all older people um tend to do that more and more even I go since I got Medicare I I go I go to the doctor once a year but I pretty much he's gotten used to the fact that I reject everything he you look like you're in radiantly good health Matthew yeah you know so for most of us am yeah look yeah for most of us there there's a moment or many many perhaps many many moments and we just feel that the plants you know called us called us to them like there's this aha moment um do do you have a one of those stories that you wouldn't mind sharing with us well let's see I my aha one aha moment I had so I studied botney because there was no way to study herbalism at age 18 1920 there was dear old Dr Lawrence so this is professor and he taught I mean this pretty crazy this old guy he taught um ethnobotany seminar on hallucinogenic plants which was like you know really fun in the early 70s and and we had various people who had done drugs show you know G give testimonies but at any I was in a field boty class by him which is a hard class that hardly exists nowadays and it barely existed then but um I did a paper on my favorite plant the burro which I understood from astrology was so saturnian and and I really understood it in a way and and at the end he said because I still didn't speak well then he said well you're not a very good speaker so you get a B for your oral presentation but you really understand the essence of that plant so you get an A and I was like holy cow somebody gets what I'm doing you know and uh and that was Dr La he was like that so that was um and and to have someone like kind of tell you what you're doing is also helpful like I you know so it was like wow somebody understands me but I also have his testimony I see that's what I am doing you know so yeah and I couldn't tell if I wanted to be an astrologer or an herbalist until I was about 28 29 and I did work at an astrological publishing company and then but I I realized I didn't want to do that and then a little herb store was starting in South Minneapolis Bob gagher present moment herbs you might have visited there at some time and he hired me I was that was 1981 I worked just one day a week and then you know a year or two later two five days a week I could never really work more than 30 hours a week I mean I was always my own person so much you know so I was starving but starving artist but uh then I and for the first year I was afraid to practice so I didn't do anything also I studied um Homeopathy first and in fact so my cousin uh Julian Winston who's well known in Homeopathy but he's been dead for about 15 years but he lived in Philadelphia and he was a big wig in and the homeopathic Revival and and I got from him I got the address of the homeopathic everything was hard mail in those days you know I got the address of the homeopathic Pharmacy in Philadelphia Bor and tafl and uh I was just going to send off to get a home remedy kit and my dad said oh why don't you get one of those for me too my uncle Rushmore had one of them I was like what you didn't tell me that Uncle Rushmore had a home remedy kit and we discovered so we knew that my grandfather had been um delivered in 1900 by a Quaker they said Chiropractic physician but there was no Chiropractic in 1903 it turned out when we put it together it was uh Homeopathy and later one of our friends in the Quaker Meeting there mother came to visit and and his mother's father was that physician was a Quaker homeopathic physician in Trenton New Jersey in 1900 and was a cousin of my grandfather and she got up said well I have his records let me see if I can find that and she said yeah he was the family doctor but he was out of town so his best friend who was a quicker homeopathic physician delivered the baby that's amazing yeah I found I had these um things and actually this is for a biblo field and you're an author in a biblo field too so so there's a classic home remedy book of 1800 like I want to find out I wanted a copy just to see what were people doing in those days so so I ordered one online I thought okay I want under $100 $100 or less and I want oh I can get it for pre something from the 1700s before before 1800 that will look good on the title page and so I find I ordered one and I came in I opened it up and there was the signature of my great great great grandmother's uncle and her father or brother I couldn't tell they had the same name yeah and um Quakers again no no so from 1774 so I had the original family of her book from way back then you know I don't know how wish they used it but I was like wow you know the other thing that you said that struck me is how you know when you were recognized for that work that you did in herbalism by your teacher that it you know it kind of confirms that you're not alone in the world that there like I've heard that from so many of our friends you know it's almost like lot so many of us were kind of odd when we were children we didn't quite fit in and then we found like a tribe and we you know we all had a very different ideas very different mindsets but this commonality of love for the earth and the plants and we found a language you know that able to speak and be understood it was was such an aha moment for all of us I think yeah was beautiful oh yeah it was so great to meet up with other people and I you know I I can't say I was a surprised I felt it just so felt so natural looking back on it with you now I'm thinking like wow yeah it was so special but um it was like just natural when I I think I went out well first I went to uh oh and those days they had the Frontier herbs in Iowa I went to to one or two conferences I attended the speaker and then um Pam Montgomery invited me out to Green nations in the early 90s I met William lassier there but I remember how I mean everybody seemed compatible it was like there was hardly anybody that you know seemed like they didn't fit in so there was room for everyone right it was like all of us we found home that was so incredible well you've mentioned several teachs that you've been inspired by already but is there is there one teacher in particular that influenced your life's work well yeah in addition to growing up on that res till I was two and then spending time on another res later R and always and I went to school in South Minneapolis always had Indian friends we we just had our 50th um anniversary um High School graduation I talked to one of my friends that grew up in the in the projects and he said oh you got beat up by myard too huh well that's you know that's life of a boy growing up in the city but uh so I can't I can't remember why I got under that but yeah so many of my early teachers were Indians in fact all of them were essentially except for Bob Gallagher the owner of the herb store I learned a few things from him but I was more of a homeopath then but yeah so I learned I would just sometimes I just learn two or three herbs and actually in the native world that is kind of you know somebody knows two or three herbs really well sometimes that that and you know and there's not as many practitioners that know tons of herbs but finally when I was I can't remember I was in my 30s I'm pretty sure and I met a guy named tsml Crow who was a Mogi and we were like blood brothers or like uh like herb Bros and uh we just for I think the first five years we met we just loved teaching together and caring notes and and uh you know learning and and it was somewhat psychic too uh later it turned out it this kind of unbelievable uh later I had a falling out with him and him with me and uh and I was talking about this with phis L and and um and after about 45 minutes of my explaining it all she said well you know this sounds like this guy who used to live in Arab her little town in in Alabama named spider and I said yeah that's one of his aliases yeah and and she knew him too and then I realized like he knew a lot she and he had some herbs three or four really in common that were not that well known you saw bone set for bone setting uh Solomon Seal a few others um that I realized were due to his living in that same area knowing kind of the same things but he and I we must have we exchanged a lot I remember and I learned a lot of Indian medicine from him and and he learned he said to one of my friends he didn't say it to me I never learned so much Indian medicine since I left a home which was Michigan for him and for me from Matt as I did for Matt so so we learned we had a similar way of thinking uh you know it's like the medicine animals and the nature is alive certainly I know you've always spoken about him with such respect yeah so that I would call him my main teacher also pier and then the first um maybe herbalist I met that I learned a lot from was William lassier Will comes up in all of our conversations you know that man had such a profound influence on American herbalism didn't he yes yeah everybody learned from him and um uh he was humble as you know and um yet great you know and I mean he was great was and he was other-dimensional like I went to his um Memorial and someone described um they were at a lecture by him on bodyw work and and the and he was working on the woman's head she was on the on the stage on a on a um massage table and working on her and she started to float up into the air and Flo about a foot and a half up and then and then floated down and back and then he said and when she got back at the table he said there I think that's enough go that's not an uncommon story about williiam no it's totally true I think that I think that people would say the same for you you're many multi-dimensional Matthew and also I think there are many stories to be told we'll get into those as some of the healing that you've seen done and done yourself but I wanted to ask you though before we got to there I I know you have a a workshop actually coming up and uh about women's roles in herbalism and I also know that you have very deep respect for for women in herbalism so would you just share a little bit about um what special roles that you think that women play in herbalism yeah well let's see so actually you guys are the majority in this profession by far I'd say in my experience well nine out of 10 herbalists are women nine out of 10 of my students are are women nine out of 10 of my clients are women and even the one man who's dragged along often turns out because his wife wanted him to come and or or mom maybe and uh so women are you know and then women I'd have to say are more badly affected by drugs so they are more alternative I don't know what the statistics are for how many people are into alternative medicine I think at one time it was about 15% I think it's actually higher now but um yeah if if it was say 25% of the country maybe 30 is that's my guess um I'd say it's probably 40 50% of women and you know 10 20 of men you know more so uh there certainly are many men you know and um you know and then and I do have it's it's a little disproportionate when we get to conferences and stuff men have more kind of like uh you know hits but get out there write books and be a teacher and be a ego and you know for better worth that helps you teach and but women are the soul and um when they do achieve a lot like you and Susan weed for instance I mean that's a lot what you guys what you two have done is like incredible amount um really more than any man I can think of because because you really were the sole of verbalism for decades and really kind of you know kept it somehow you you just you had that vibe that I I could always feel that out in the herbal atmosphere and I felt like like it kept us from fighting and I I think of some of the big egos none of them named all of them really good people dedic all them dedicated herbalism but we could have fought um and we didn't and uh I just think that's the the example that you gave and also your Vibe somehow this I call Cloud medicine just kind of the vapor going over the whole landscape and and keeping us all in order so that was a contribution from you plus you just always had an eye for who was kind of really interesting in the field and brought them to and and great conferences that you did the international spectacular and and who would have thought of that I I mean I I just I was like Wow an international herb Symposium somebody can pull that off like but Rosemary yeah and then Susan weed you know I mean on the one hand she created on the other hand she brought out of The Mists of History you know Wise Women herbalism which um there's a lot of herbal female herbalists who do not do the nurture thing I had a I was on her program one time and you know Samuel Thompson's Mentor Mrs Benton she'd give one herb after another until it raised a sweat which is totally not you know nutritive herbalism and I I said well there's a wise woman that was not a wise woman herbalist you know and actually you know the the mother of the you know spec I mean herbally speaking not literally of uh Thompson who was so important in the American herbal movement so you guys have provided the soul and yeah it's Phyllis and myself I see they put my name first I've got to correct that they should put phyllis's name first and Phyllis of course is ideal Phyllis and you are some of the only women who grew up with mothers or grandmothers who taught him um herbal medicine both of you I think was your grandmother yeah and if I remember yeah and um I mean you learned things like cupping and um um just Old Country I mean which is really valuable there's so many young people whose parents now are our age right who are teaching those young people so we see an entire New Generation who are learning from their Elders because they've all been trained by us you know or by other earthists of this generation so we're seeing it um that tradition actually growing it's so good yeah going on and on and on yeah and we are really well established they could try to make us illegal but we would not disappear by any means well rooted we're well rooted yeah and I mean that's incredible because you do remember the days when I know you were persecuted just for even having an herb store socially in Sebastapol or that area gville but um but also legally you know and then that's what I felt in president M herbs um for the first year I just kind of I didn't do anything I was like Bob can practice you know he already so dope so he was already a blw breaker but but and I got to say he was ahead of his time because he would love it nowadays when that's legal you know he wasn't you know he wasn't just trying to make money or something he he just was a natural law breaker he just didn't want to conform but so so that's the kind of person I had to have to begin practice with in the Arab store after a year I started giving advice and more and more and I'm really glad I don't know and you know it's kind of funny one thing I learned from him how to take a case like like he would always measure the person as he was talking like before he'd commit himself like if you're illegal as an herbalist you know as well as a dope dealer then you know you assess it's like where's this person coming from what's there what do they really want which is really important and that that's important before you even start an herbal um con be before you really get into asking what the thing is nowadays I don't really have trouble with that but in those days I'd occasionally you know worry about someone or they I thought they were maybe litigious or or they were you know they were some kind of agent but um that might have been my imagination I can say for the first 15 years I was afraid every day I I woke up I was I was gonna get arrested I didn't realize I don't really arrest you you go did you go that too no really I was always bold I never worried about it in my herb store I just whatever anybody came in I just like if I could help them I would I never worried about it I started worrying about it when other people started working for me you know for their sakes so I would always say you know try to share with them that it's better to be really careful but in those days even like with formulas even when I was using herbs that you know were like sassa fras that you weren't supposed to put in formulas I would put it in and I just put a statement right right right on that the FDA doesn't approve of this but it's actually perfectly safe I put it in my catalog and everything so I was just lucky that you know I was kind of like trying to wave a red flag and thankfully everybody avoided it they didn't pay any attention I think it was just such a small red flag that nobody really cared one thing I noticed so we had our little hippy herb store I'd call it and it's like like I know that was offensive at first and Sebastapol hard to believe but but for the FDA like I think that actually disarmed them they didn't really care oh there's a bunch of hippies oh they're not trying to appeal to science God they believe in astrology ha haa that protects you it's like when you try to be real scientific that they really go after you and hate you you know is true you know so we talked about this earlier of how so much of your work you teach and you write yes but so much of your work has really focused you've been you know you have been a practitioner really and I know whenever I would have you come those wonderful times when I would have you come to Sage mountain and you would teach at my advanc programs and those were always very special weeks but people would drive for literally they come from Stakes away you know to see you for consultations so I'm just wondering if you have a story of like I mean I've heard stories and I have what I'm going to share of you that I have seen you kind of work what I Calla Miracle but do you have any particular story that you want to share about how the herbs work through you yeah let's see so one I remember um from that I I hope it's not the story that you have that I treated so someone came to see me see me or I was in the class at your place and she was 42 and she wanted to get pregnant and really as you know really um because I know because of your mail book that just juicing people up getting you know at that age sapto berock various things that are juice really help a person and you know and in addition I looked at her tongue took a pulse whatever I could tell so I said um so she was pregnant within five days and and what this story even better was that I had a client years later she was 29 and she'd been they declared she' $10,000 in this is like 15 years ago $10,000 in fertility treatment to no avail she already had one kid they wanted to have another and her mother and her had both well the doctors called it premature um menopause that they stopped menstrating by age 28 29 so and her mother it had been the same thing well to me again that's just getting them um juicing them up on remedies and this I do remember that I gave her berock and um I did have some True Unicorn route which is famous for that which I had a very little stock that I'd had which I still have some oh I found a 2 O of from 1895 True Unicorn route in a in an antique store I was like yeah I'll take that God that's amazing yeah so I gave her that and I joked about I joked about how this woman had got pregnant within five days and she called me back later and she said I got pregnant within five days yeah that's pretty amazing yeah that's always so traumatic for women you know for families it's really that's a that's a beautiful Miracle story I have a story I shared this story so many times but um it was also a time when you were at Sage mountain and we were all outside and we were in The Terrace Gardens there all those Rock Terrace Gardens and you were teaching it's a beautiful sunny day and Cheryl who's one of my really good friends and she's this really hearty strong you know Vermont woman she's lived in Vermont all her life she just stepped on that stone wall wrong and she came down and she just we could hear her ankle like you know just Crunch and right away it just started swelling getting really big and black and blue and you very calmly every we're all huddled around her you know like you very calmly said go gather some Elder and Yaro you know and everybody scampers off and comes back and you just you make a pus and you put it right on her we're all just sitting out there you just put the herbs on her and then you keep teaching and literally I mean like so she couldn't even walk when that happened you know she was down on her knees and sitting there and really I would say in about 40 minutes I usually say 20 I really think it was more like 20 minutes but we'll stretch it to 40 her ankle was all the swelling was out of that ankle and she got up and walked on it it was like I'm looking at her going so it's not just the herbs it's also something that you did with those herbs I'm sure of it because I've Ed that I've used Elder and yarl many times after that and it does work really well but somehow I have the juju with that combination do you remember that time Matthew I do I didn't remember all I remember is yeah with the stone walls and something happened and I did help somebody that's all I can remember but no that's great to have that story filled in Elder is good when there's puffiness around a joint so that's why that went in there and of course Yaro um you know there probably was a hemorrhage in there and uh so that would make a lot of sense there and you know I I like Elder Yaro better than arnica even and you know nothing could have shaken my face arnica as a younger practitioner except Yaro I like better too because Yaro is always around arica is around sometimes but Yaro is always there you know the other thing that you kind of have brought I think you you probably are the one who re um you know who really brought the idea of dose dropping you know like one drop but I I remember one time I was sitting in on one of your consultations and you you put a drop on a Kleenex or something and gave the lady that like you know just a hold or something it was like not even in her mouth and going this is not GNA work Matthew but sure enough like in 20 minutes that woman is looking at you going my symptoms are feeling so much better and she meant it seriously she wasn't wasn't like conceivable for her so do you want to share a little bit about that um well actually so I don't like politics but um it's political because when I was young in the herb store there was the flow Essences the herbs and the homeopathics and of course as you know there's some homeopathics like Hy St John's or uh eupatorium Bonet Elder SAS that are in both and you can pretty much see they're used the same way and um in fact we sometimes learn from them and them from us so I didn't like the idea of like people thinking that the plant properties depended on how they were prepared so I wanted something that was kind of between all of them and that was drop doses one to three drops was kind of my standard in the old days one of my main students full-time herbalist Minneapolis at least W she still uses one drop a lot of the time I've kind of loosened up I'll use and definitely if an herb is kind of nutritive I'll go to 5 10 15 occasionally 25 drops um oat grass or um milky oat seed rather or things that are more nutritive um Nettles certainly taking tea and actually I have been converted to some of um Susan weed's um qut jar um decoctions or infusions yes right yeah so that was kind of I just didn't want people to think I wanted to kind of prove that herbs work no matter which system um but okay if you use them in the small dose though they're more um they act on the immune system which has you know which is very finely tuned te- cells there's I there's actually a little teeny bit of uh research on this by hermit heiney he I ne and someone else a German he was associated with Trail so he had a bias um but the bystander B bystander reaction Loop is how the te- cells um trigger get triggered and and it's and they found you know one part in a thousand they could get a response to a toxic or non-toxic herb and um so yeah yeah so that's only been done once but um um with with three herbs but um that's one way that herbs work but another way as you know like is a melage or an astringent very topically both internally and externally just really changes things and really acts fairly mechanically I'd say that you're not using the essence you're using the mechanics of herbs and you can get intuitive and good at either method either method I think you have to be intuitive um strange to say and um I'm not very good at the use of large herbs although I've been studying Samuel Thompson of late and it's like wow some of these things I mean some of the stuff he treated was like unbelievable I wouldn't dream of it with a Dro those like a guy with a pitchfork T stuck in next to his eye into a skull like he kept him sweating for a week uh in a little you know those houses in those days are size of your smallest bedroom and kept the stove going and sweating and he you know by the end of the week he was getting his vision back the blood was starting to drain out of the area I mean look like and that's just one of his case history so it's like wow that was by understanding how to manipulate sweat heat and water and he also believed in getting rid of the canker the Arma the um mucus um deposits on the membranes yeah so so very impressive very different and very intuitive though it was clear this guy knows what he's doing I think this guy knows what he's doing too yeah it's been amazing to watch that you know just the so many practitioners now use that it's pretty yeah it's amazing so do you have any special plant allies that are just like your special friends that you always call on that are always there for you well Solomon Seal which as you know we've discussed is a little bit environmentally uh challenged so if you're going to use Salamon seal you should plant it in your garden or I would say probably I think it's okay to buy the Chinese Solomon Seal because I think they've been growing it for hundreds of years if you know huge beds of it yeah we'll pick some but um don't advertise them and appears to me Solomon Seal is best known and used by kind of small fs and stuff for the people selling the the salves and things so that's one of them Yaro you couldn't be in herbalist and not like Yaro and Elder and oh and I know and find this so true and funny you know no matter what your philosophy of herbalism when is when you start and if you're a guy then you're more like you know but no matter what it is after 15 years all herbis agree they you know they all kind of say oh yeah yeah are oh great you know I mean and they all kind of know the same uses and they all kind of think the same way we're kind of mechanics and philosophers and I mean I've seen this again and again that like you know uh there's some people that want to you know hold their own Road maybe but um a row but uh mostly people just end up in the same place and it so it's an empirical art that is experience-based Art where you end up in the same place because it's the uh innate truisms of Mother Nature and the plant so that's a that's a really beautiful statement what about nettle is nettle one of your oh yes of course yeah and of course the great David Hoffman's statement when in doubt nles which I know it's like a yeah oh that's that would good t-shirt yeah right ah uh yeah my insurance agent of all people he his he married somebody who was kind of a nalist or body worker but he said yeah I went to we went to England and I dislocated my shoulder great big guy like me you know so when you really throw it out when you're big you really throw it out and and I went down to the local pub and said well is there anybody who could help me with something like this and and they said oh there's a little old lady up the street and and he went to her and she had a whole and she opened up her backyard and there was like nettle like 10 feet high and she made like she made nettle she made it nettle pus and it went back in place yeah yeah yeah that's a wild blood you know I I heard you mentioning recently that as you're getting older you actually feel younger you have far less aches and and um achy joints and stuff because of the of the of the um Solomon Seal right yeah yeah although I was teaching a class recently and I realized also wormwood um in my 50s I was starting to get so stiff all over you know the word rheumatism is actually a good word but it's not scientific nowadays but but that's you just feel oh oh and one of my um I was given drop doses to somebody of warmwood which is a good idea because it's really you take one drop you're like whoa I had a student break out in tears and um just um a couple days ago from one drop and um the whole class is say how much did you take one drop and but but uh at any rate so um I had a student who wanted to take more or a client and she so she got some worwood and she came to the consult and we made up some warmwood tea and we each took a a tea just a a a cup of of wormwood tea and that totally got rid of this um room stiffness everywhere and about five years later that started to come back and I took another single cup and gone so I mean which also shows you I mean these herbs they are so incredibly intelligent and can do so much and and we don't know I mean oh that was one thing Bob Gallagher the owner of the store said to me in my first year the thing about herbalism you can never know it all there's always a new Leaf to turn that's a beautiful quote and that one's beautiful yeah that's so incredible you used to tell I forget the name of this woman but there was a friend that you had that you were she was just constantly getting herself into trouble you were every time you'd come back say who is that Susan was her name Susan yes Susan and she has a little Earth actually well one story that I remember that you told was when she um she had actually been out M mushroom foraging and she had eaten some mushrooms that made her really sick and you drove her to the hospital you want to tell the story yeah I'll tell that story well it's even crazier than that um she was forging in her backyard and she ate a um it was pretty clear it was a avenging angel of death um amonita and it was on the news don't let dogs eat it don't let your cats eat it your rather your kids rather and uh so it was a nice summer night in August and I got home and I didn't it was a Saturday night I don't always answer my phone machine in those days phone machine 1992 I think it was and um I didn't always answer but I thought oh better and there was Susan on the phone help I ate a poison mushroom so I called her up and yeah yeah she she was lying on the floor she'd already vomited a whole lot a friend of her from the neighborhood had come over and I said okay uh let's see yeah don't go to the hospital she didn't want to go anyways um I'll get there and I had a I had a third of an ounce of um milk thistle seed just actually the seed there weren't as many standardized extracts in but I didn't have one at any rate and um and she said I and I said uh this sounds like fun so um and again you know by this age you know and it's like you like put the red flag out you just didn't you just had so much confidence in the herbs and in the spirit of the herbs Spirit of nature that you you weren't afraid and so I drove to her house and we G gave her that and um and she was you know well she's only like 80 pounds and she' vomited probably 15 times or so so she was pretty cleaned out and exhausted and said we better go to the hospital now we'll take take you to the hospital and um so we bundled her up and put her on the backseat of the car and it happened that there was a sheet of paper there that was a single sheet of by Steph Foster of um use of milk thistle for amonita poisoning so I thought oh well well you so and on the way to the hospital so she's in the back seat she said I can see the other side and then a couple blocks later he said they're coming to take me and then as we're coming into the parking lot she said it's the right herb Paul her in and I put the sheet in a whole entry thing and the evening was Unforgettable we sat for about an hour in the um waiting room with you know in the inner city of the balls of the inner city city in South Minneapolis and there was a 10 20 there was 15 20 other people in there then I still remember the night because it was the night that PeeWee Herman got busted so it was all on the news it was like and all these people from the other city like wow my life isn't as weird as some other people's lives you just and then the nurse came out just a beautiful nurse she said your friend is going to be okay we've taken her upstairs for we're going to keep her overnight and um so Susan said so they brought her back there they had heart monitor on and her potassium level was going down she knew a little bit about medicine and and they were hovering around and orderly a doctor and the nurse and hovering around and and then all of a sudden and the the heart thing monitor was going crazy and all of a sudden it just went normal and they fit him with the dials and they looked at her and and the nurse picked a a b thistle seed off her clothes and said so what's this and and Susan said uh uh I don't know it's the antidote maybe at this point it was like out of Harry Potter you know it was like oh we went to the the the the regular person's Hospital instead of the but so and they like look at her you know and so then they take her up to the room that's where and so Paul and I went up and she'd been there before when she had Crohn's disease for six months overmedicated on opioids and so she hated that the ICU there but so they in fact they they were going to put her in the same room she assisted a different room but um so there she is she's in there sitting on a chair I don't want to be here they're they're making me stay here I I want to go and they won't make they won't let me smoke Paul and I are sitting there and then the doctor comes in and he's got like a bunch of sheets of paper you know like one of those clipboards I don't know they still have them but they probably they I'm sure they don't oh they do okay so he he's like looking at it and he says so what's going on what's the problem what happened and and she says I ate a poison mushroom and he like he says like yeah where'd you get it luns like uh gr grocery store chain he figured she was just a drug OD and and um she said no I found it in my backyard and I could see this never happened to me any other time but I I I could see these letters over his head like his actual thought was oh my God this woman's crazy and then and then um he's going on and on he says well this this says you have Crohn's like you could you could die any I mean you could this is a fatal disease you could die any time who is your doctor who is this Crohn's and she she says no I know the difference this is not Crohn's he accepted that who's your doctor who's your regular doctor said well uh I saw Dr Smith at Park nicholet a year ago he says what what you're you hav't been to a doctor for a year you're supposed to check in once a month you could die any time like and um that was another didn't want to go to the hospital and um she didn't want to get me in trouble too but she over imagined that and but I could see again what what you're supposed to go I I could see the letters over his head and it was oh my God I'm not primary health care provider so did he ever know that she took the milk disce did he ever find out yeah and and she had been in the hospital so many times before like so there's like in those days they had paper Records Was a foot and a half High um some years later her husband she married uh his friend was a doctor and he they got her medical records you know and there was green sheets which is Intensive Care Unit and and and his this understand the story here because she's such an amazing person his uh his friend says wow I've never seen sobody was somebody with so many green sheets who who was still alive it's like we have to shoot her to try to get rid of her oh oh I see somebody already tried that she had a gunshot think that you made her up actually because every time you'd come back to you know school or i' see you at any conference I'd always hear another Susan story but you know the thing that's really remarkable is that in Europe they keep milk thisle extract you know it's like the only thing that's known to counteract mushroom poisoning so you probably did save her life that day you know I mean really yeah yeah absolutely yeah and um then there's a little Indian craft store in South Minneapolis and it just a coincidence so I told a bunch of people my friend the Proprietors of that store she was telling somebody over the front desk and a woman walked up from the back of the store and she said I'm an emergency room nurse at Abbott Northwestern Hospital and my best friend was the one who handled that case and we got some we got some milk thisle and we have it in our locker and my friend said well you could lose your license for using using that and she said I'd rather lose my license than a patient yeah of course I mean it's so simple but it sounds so powerful right well Matthew I can't believe it we're coming close to the end of our time together and I could I could just listen to your stories forever honestly and I I have I know your stories and I know that there's I actually can validate them because I've seen so many of them that are you know of the people that you've helped and worked with but I did want to ask you a couple more questions one is I noticed that I didn't really know about this I think mostly because traveling and teaching so much but that you started your own herb School the Matthew Wood Institute of herbalism can you share with me a little bit about that yeah well that's online and even though I love to travel I got many planets in the ninth house for travel um astrology wise but um one has to well with Co one had to settle down Ed so uh we're trying to have an herb program online and um we're still to do it right it's just taken well really a year of working consistently on the first year program or maybe a year and a half whereas before that we were just collecting classes for about four or five years um I just speak once a month and then we'd have some special classes Phyllis light and I are mostly um working together on that and a few other people here and there um and sometimes it's just whatever topics we feel like talking about um at the beginning of covid we did one on the respiratory tract because that was really timely and we philis and I love teaching organ systems in that well I think philis and I taught one time at your your place weekend yeah yeah so we're a natural when we get together we're uh online even yeah so um so yeah it's just uh so we have an enormous number of classes and we do have a discount for people your students people watching this and um uh so you can look up Matthew Wood instituteof herbalism domcom I think is what you can do of course my books are out there and uh I'm uh yeah the last one the holistic uh medicine and the extra cator Matrix really um is a really good book a moment because I had the privilege of reviewing it Matthew and I felt it was like one of the most powerful books that has come out in years um and I you know I'm concerned that a lot of herbalists don't know about you know because it's just it's it's not your usual you know herb book in the sense that we're looking at herbal remedies for whatever do you mind speaking about that book I I was blown out when I read away when I read that book so would you mind speaking about it for a moment The extracellular Matrix is all the stuff inside here between the capillary and the cell which is I you know the inner ocean I don't know it's 70% of the body something like that and uh and of course uh or all the liquids are 70% and um it is and it conditions the cell's life the cell is totally controlled by the Matrix The Matrix tells it to eat to to uh eliminate to migrate to um procreate even the cell does not replicate without information from the Matrix so the Matrix is the brains of the cell and as I say in the book this is such a great line um it's not the it's not the nucleus that's the genitals of the cell that's the reproductive organ and we humans always get our brains and our genitals mixed up so we don't really understand we don't really understand this It seems impossible but the environment of the cell controls the cell and that's what's important and that is now modern science and it has disproved the cell theory it's disproved the whole idea of modern medicine of that to get the molecule to hit the receptor the Le to to cure through the through the cell that's outmoded that's about 30 years out of date now and little by little medicine will change to knowledge of the Matrix treating to correct the the environment of the cell is a more profound way and more correct way and I do give some and of course so so our mucilages and our astringents act particularly not not just on the membranes but deep into the Matrix as well as some other stuff and I do go across some some herbs for that i' I'd say I to give an example I never understood chickweed until I understood the Matrix and I realized oh that's why it works so well externally and almost better externally than any other way it just works it's it's penetrates into the Matrix yeah um I have seen it's kind of like I chose the wrong word the word uh interstitium is more coming into use in um uh medicine in the last couple years in American Medicine maybe it may be different different German medicine and I so I picked the wrong word that's what they're talking about to the um I like that word Matrix actually yeah it's a powerful wonderful book and um all of your books are published what's the publishing company that publishes those your books that one's now published by Inner Traditions the other ones are published by North Atlantic press yeah yeah I have one on pulse diagnosis I published with Lulu Publications yeah we have links on our website to uh ma or Matthew that people will be able to link and I also have a full bio I never whenever I introduce my beloved friends I always just kind of take Snippets but there's so much about so much riches about the work you've done so I'd like to just finish with um just one last question is in all the things that you've done in your herbal work these last what 40s something years what is it that you're most proud of at least at this moment you know like what is it that you can look back and just feel the best about well that astrologer she said you will never feel complete until you have published a book written a book and I knew instantly that was a book that became the book of verbal wisdom I knew I had to write it when I was finished I was like thank goodness and and and the rest of my life was gravy like um even though that's maybe been superseded in knowledge-wise by other books and other knowledge that was the thing I had to write showing that plants had a definite sort of identity pattern and personality and in fact it was an astrologer then said oh I was about 55 or so many years later I was about 32 then when I wrote that and she said so have you completed your life work and I said yeah I guess I have you know astrologers they just can see into you sometimes and and and she said yeah it's like you lead like the life of Riley like I can just tell you just don't have that burning inner thing to you know I'm still doing all the things I do since then I'll build on that and continue Contin that but but uh that was kind of the crucial thing I had to do that I had to get that book out and I and I do have to say then when I wrote the Earthwise herbal it got so I could just read the constituents and look at a picture I could just understand what it was for and even if I hadn't used it like ACAA I remember writing the Acasa I understand this plan it's I don't know yeah so I have fulfilled and still going on I mean that's kind of NE always doing new things though you're you're always fulfilling the next you know so we yeah it it's incredible thank you Matthew so much for joining us and just sharing I know that really I've heard so many of your stories and I I just wish we had another hour maybe I'll invite you back on again because I I do love listening to your stories and so appreciative of all the work you've done for all of us so yeah thank you thank you thank you I say I had every single case history memorized until I wrote the book of Pur widom and then after that I can hardly remember any of them so so um I I don't have as many good stories as I was well some of them are in your books you know but they're tucked in your books and also a lot of them are tucked in your friends like me we have the stor so it's good that that we're all sharing them well thank you sweetie thank you so much to [Music] here I am thankful to be here I am thankful to be [Music] here
