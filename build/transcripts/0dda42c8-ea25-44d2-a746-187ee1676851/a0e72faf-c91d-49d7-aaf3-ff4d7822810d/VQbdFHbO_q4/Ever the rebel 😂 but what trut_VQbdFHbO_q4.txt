i think it's exciting to be controversial actually to me it gets a little boring when everybody thinks what you're doing it used to be you know i tell people i'm an herbalist and most people would look away very uncomfortably you know i used to say i spent most of my life being the least popular person in the party now it's so accepted that it's like oh well what will i do next not really but i think you know what i'm saying i think it's it's wonderful to bring something forward that's not fully understood and that's fully accepted and so you're on the edge the most diversity the most life grows on the edges of things where you have things that are meeting and so right now it's the edge of medicine is the merging of this ancient tradition of medicine that's still practiced by more people in the world than any other system coming together with the modern system that's fairly new you know and so we're seeing this wonderful edge and this creativity i think it's beautiful [Music] you
