one of the really great strong points about herbalism is it's kitchen medicine you can do it in your kitchen if you want it can be very inexpensive it can also be expensive and you can go and buy high-end products that are very costly as well but the fact that you can make high-end products yourself in your kitchen for very little money it keeps it still in people's power they know what they're picking they know when they're harvesting it some people might want to pick by the moon they might want to pick by the cycles they might want to say the special blessings that are empowering their medicine so it keeps it in our kitchen keeps the medicine powerful for us and i really love herbalism that's one of the reasons that i love it so very much
