is nowhere else on the planet that an herbalist would rather be than with the plants in the garden or in the woods in the meadows and why is that it's because of course the plants really just speak directly to us i think for most of us who carry that green gene in our bloods that special relationship with the plants we hear the plants deepest when we're with them and you can hear them in your apothecary or your kitchen for certain but when they're in their living force in their natural environments they speak loudly i'm not necessarily meaning that i hear them talking in english to me but plants have their own language sometimes that language is interpreted as a feeling that we have like you come into the garden and you feel more joyful you feel more full of life you might feel wholer more peaceful that's the plants really working through us communicating offering us their medicine not so much in a physical way but in the way that they are [Music]
