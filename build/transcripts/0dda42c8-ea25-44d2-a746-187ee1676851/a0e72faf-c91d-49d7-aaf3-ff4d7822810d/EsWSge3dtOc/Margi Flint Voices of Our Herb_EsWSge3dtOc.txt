hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant and healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do and I can feel the [Music] sky I know that I'm part of the when I see the sunrise I am thankful to be here I am thankful my welcome guest today is the Beloved and well-known herbalist Margie flit she is also a dear close friend and she was a student at my first Apprentice program in New England when I moved to Vermont in the late 1980s Mary served as the Beloved Village herbalist to the S Co town of of Marblehead for over 40 years at her home in Marblehead she's founded Earth Song herbals a busy herbal Center where she taught classes made herbal products offered herbal consultations and trained a generation or two a verbalist she likes to say she's retired but she's really almost as busy as ever Margie continues to travel throughout Europe Canada and the US offering courses on herbalism facial diagnosis and reading the body as a clinical diagnostic tool she's a professional member of the American herbalist Guild a staff member of Pacific Rim College in British Columbia and is taught at numerous universities colleges and hospitals her book The practicing herbalist a self-published labor of love is considered by many to be the definitive guide to setting up and running an herbal practice this 500 plus page book is a treasure Trove of invaluable information that Margie has gained during her 40 plus years of herbal practice I've often heard her sayth plants and my clients are my most revered teachers you can find out more about Margie's work at earthsong herbal.com welcome Margie it's so great to have you here this is so much fun it's like I have the best job in the world I get to hang out with my friends it is a pretty good job I think that's probably why herbalists never really retire right you know most of us are in our 70s and even 80s now we still we keep saying we're going to slow down but we love what we do so much and I see that in you for certain so let's start with that simple like that aha moment you I know you've had many aha moments with the plants but if there's a story or a memory you have of a time when you know a plant just called to you just it was like kind of a wakeup call for you and you know claimed you really uh well the plant that has claimed me is don't like to say this around the other plants but my favorite plant is Yaro and Yar is everywhere in my life and I need it in my life and she stands behind me and protects me like a big Female warrior and it's like I feel Invincible when I am with Yaro and you know she's my companion and my protector and and really often times my savior those times you're out cutting things in your garden and like whoops I cut that right up that vein that would have been successful you know and you know staunching bleeding and you know every condition of blood and I do have so much of it so you when you talk about yarao as being your savior you don't mean just on an um emotional or spiritual level you mean actually on a physical level as well yeah I love that you chose um such a common plant like you said it's everywhere around you well well I learned that from you who was my first teacher Rosemary gladstar so yeah I mean you taught us you know 150 years ago that if we go outside and a plant is abundant around us we're meant to consume that and you know it's I love yoro I she's just always with me very agree and so many incredible Legends and stories about that play and it is a it's a great one so um is there a defining moment when you actually you know knew you were an herbalist or called yourself an herbalist I know for so many people that's it's so tentative like when do I say I'm an herbalist well I'm not sure I would have called myself an herbalist but I was called to the herbs uh and that was in uh oh what was it called a Gaia herb Symposium when it was at the 4 camp in Massachusetts and it was that first one where I met you and so many wonderful herbalists at that one Gathering you and David Winston so my first real first teachers and it was only 65 people I think which included the chefs and the teachers and the students and when I was there it w you walked in on the land and looked around and I felt like I was transported in time back to some ancient Gathering it was like oh these are my people and then when it was time to go I just sat in the circle while everyone was singing and sobed because I didn't want to leave it's like the this is where I belong yeah I know just what you mean you know it's um it seems to be a recurring theme among our generation of verbalists really that we found family community tribe you know almost instantly it wasn't like something that we had to work through you know it was like oh I'm I'm back home where do you think that came from I do I actually do believe it's ancient I I um I think we're meant to be connected to Nature and so much of the modern world is detached too much from it and that feeling of having your feet on the earth and looking into the eyes of people that you look at them and think this is my sister this is my brother and that feeling it's like oh it's the functional family not the dysfunctional family we CH we chose together together oh yeah that's a good window you know one of the things I I think it's such a great model that you've created and was just brilliant was well you created Like This brilliant path of learning for yourself where where you would you would always you know You' meet with a teacher and if you really wanted to study with them you would invite them to your Center and then you know you study with them for years actually ask them I would make them come to me I remember poor David David Winston used to drive all the way from New Jersey driving you know and he would drive drive drive get here and I'd have five people around the table to learn and the kids I had little kids then running around and he would teach I wouldn't have to pay and he'd get paid by those four you know five students you know we could not do that today with him could we so it not only served you this method of learning you know bringing the teachers to you it really served your community as well my children and your children oh I I feel very strongly about that now that so many years I mean my babies are in their 40s now and uh but the impact of having you and David and all the other amazing teachers that have come and got I mean it was normal Gabriel said uh mom I never realized that your friends were all these incredibly famous herbalists and they helped raise me and it's true I mean David Winston would sit around we can't say these things now but he would talk about remaking yourself the path to becoming human those stories and the kids sitting in this group of amazing brilliant students all listening to the life of a story and drumming and you know what a wonderful way to be raised and I think that Taps back into what we were originally talking about there's something about the ancientness of herbal connection and the kids were raised in that and it made them very stable yeah they are very beautiful well adjusted creative children adults really you know I just have to ask you this because you said you couldn't talk about it you couldn't mention it um and I think it's important to just mention what those things are that we're not supposed to talk about or mention anymore you know we're Elders we can say anything we want yeah okay well it's interesting uh right I'm doing a keynote for the main fungi Fest and wonderful I'm gonna be there oh cool I didn't know that oh par yeah um yeah I think I'm gonna touch on um I I keep thinking oh I'm gonna do the mother of the universe talk it's like all right children it's time to get along be nice to each other use kind words all this calling out stuff is inappropriate behavior and I mean one reason I love the Great Lakes herb fair is that everybody is so nice just the way it was back at Gua all those years ago at that first conference everybody was just there loving the plant it was the plants that brought us together and nobody cared if you were tall short thin fat green blue whatever you know love is all there is John Lennon yeah so um is there a teacher uh I know there is but I'd love for you to talk about the teacher that most influenced your work and maybe helped you become the herbalist that you are today well I you know I of course William lassier who I've written the book based on his knowledge but really Rosemary you get first credit you were my first teacher yeah you and David you were my first teachers and the early I find that everyone the first teachers they have have the biggest impact and you knew William and David knew William and Matthew Wood knew William and you know I would say that's my my what you know I can't take K and then de green I could go on forever so uh but William lassier was in my opinion the premier herbalist of the 20th century as far as creating a western herbal medicine diagnostic you know reading the face nails and tongue that was really based on the the beautiful melting thought of this country you know cuz he did Huna South American stuff uh First Nation stuff Chinese medicine ayurveda everything and he made it into this wonderful magical presentation that it just works for me I mean when he taught me the diagnostic stuff it was like a funnel came over my head and all you know as he's talking away this information is going in it's like what a miracle it's staying you know does that does not always happen you know I always have thought it's so interesting to hear you say that Margie because I've always thought that you know that's really the best gift that a teacher can give is unlocking um the key of your own ancestral knowledge you know and just allowing that information either to arise from you or be poured in you know it just and and that I've heard you mention that before that you know that was one of the ways that M he just kind of downloaded that information into you yeah and you've done I I want to say that um you've just done this brilliant job of keeping his work alive and you know very fluid in these times after after he passed away so tragically was so much younger and I didn't get to interview him I know well I do have you want to know a secret yes everybody else is gonna know it too so um his children have asked me to uh publish his writings so exciting to hear I said yes immediately yeah so why do you think I mean I know that we all look at William as being This brilliant messenger you know of both past and present information so what do you think it was about him that was able to to chat yeah think I think like um you know how the Renaissance had all these brilliant people that had innovative ideas and everything was so alive and new and fresh and I think I think William was a Vortex and sucked in all this energy and information and channeling pathoras and all this stuff U you know he was a man of extremes in alwayss you know I I feel well I won't go there but um I knew him later in his life when he wasn't the wild young man that's when I knew him really well it's like know so um but he was he received information and was able to transmute it in a way that solidified into concept that he shared and he was really brilliant you know and today he would have been thrown under the bus for bad behavior no he wouldn't have mind actually you know it wouldn't have mattered to him um you know you know one of the things along with the system of facial Diagnostic and reading the body he also really um brought that whole triangular system of formulation system yep you know so many herbalists myself included have adapted and you know changed and shifted but his original design of that was amazingly gr do you want to share do you mind sharing what about that is not my absolute specialty so I'm gonna say save that for David Winston um but I will say about William he really encouraged his students to take his information and then create their own like David teaches the system with a little David Winston twist twist on it you know that's great you know I don't want my students to be little cookie cut cookie cutter mes and you said that to me way in the beginning of my career you said I said I don't know how I can I can't go out and dance naked in the forest at 6 teach all day and then do a nighttime class and then sing Under the Stars I don't have that kind of energy and you said oh honey you don't have to be like me you can be your own person remember I used to fall asleep at 3 o00 in every class of yours well it could have been because I was boring so no it wasn't because you were boring it was like okay filled to the Mac must pass out you know I wanted to um just talk a little bit about your beautiful Center that you've created and it continues to be just such a wonderful heart center you know many herbalists and the herb teachers when they're coming through they always love to stop at your place and oh now it's a center for fun it's not really a center for classes anymore other than you know a couple of reading the body classes in the garden but yeah it's so close to Logan Airport and I have this massive home I have to rationalize owning in my singleness and so you know like the International's coming up so I'm going to have you know Jim McDonald Matthew Wood uh Mindy green Anna Fernandez uh Jane Holly Stevens and oh uh Asheville Mark uh Williams I know oh yeah Mark Mark Williams yes there'll probably be more and I have room for them it's very generous you know it's not generous Rosemary it's selfish there's another way of looking at it but you know I'm curious like um in your the busiest days of your programs you know you were making products you were seeing clients you were teaching classes there and it all happened in your home so how was that for you I I know you mentioned earlier it was wonderful for the children but I'm just curious like having such a busy public life in your home if you don't mind sharing a little of how that was for you I'm an extrovert I love people you know Co was the tortures of hell so you know I I like having people in my house and then when they're gone I'm glad they're gone because I get to have my quiet but you know I am a people person I love people I love sharing my space and my food and my drink and my garden and Jazz and I you know I I love entertaining I it could be because of my parents you know they made us entertain their business associates you know they would have these lovely you know after meeting dinner parties and we would have to serve or deres and have polite conversation that was intelligent so you know practice that was really good practice yeah I I know exactly what you mean I'm the same way and I just I think also because almost all the herbalist and say all of them that you know are such brilliant intelligent heartful people so it's you know it's a good it's good company yeah really good company yeah you know I wanted to ask you about you know your teaching at the universities and hospitals and colleges you know at the time especially it was a unique experience to be invited and yet you received an in invitation to teach at T's Medical University which was quite prestigious that's a good story so I had just literally the day before completed my guild application professional membership thing and why do you want to join the guild and I wrote to bridge the gap between herbal and Western medicine okay and the next day the phone rang and astred pujari who's now one of the top holistic doctors in Seattle uh asked me if I would come and do a lecture at lunchtime to the students and I said yes and she said are you sure they're going to be eatting I said I don't care so I went in and lectured and the the people the four people who were most opposed to um integrative or herbal medicine said oh we want her back here you think she could do a pre-selective course and I taught there for six years oh wow that's really incredible so how was that experience for you and you know like actually teaching at the you know because you're it was really good it was a devotion you know they should have paid me way more but um I realized a number of things one I realized that doctors go into medicine for the right reason or the ones I met they go in to help people and heal people and then you know med school beats it out of them my friend one of my students was uh Michael Gregor he wrote how not to die oh and he said I said 'w you know I'd ask him why did you take this course and they'd say he wrote I I came to retrieve my soul and so many of those students were there because they had a grandparent who always talked about Herbal Remedies but they didn't save the information and they they missed that you know I miss my grandmother or I wish I'd paid attention to those recipes so they were coming you know to tap into some ancient familial something I mean it was it was a rich experience yeah for them and for you absolutely yeah yeah it's really incredible yeah yeah so you know one of your Specialties as a practitioner and a teacher you know on your bra of teaching it has been your emphasis on facial diagnosis and using you know learning to read the body as a diagnostic tool so that's all that's all William lassier um and you know David taught me some of his things too and uh will Morris also yeah he taught me all that year stuff that is what really stuck with you know the this part of the cartilage here is the spine wow and if you pinch on it and then look at the tongue and see if there are little Wiggles in the same areas and then touch the spine they all match up you got three so you found this to be an incredible diagnostic SK skill you know it's not taught in the medical schools or anything I don't think there are any teachers really who are used to be I know it used to be but I mean currently and yet I do you have any um examples of how reading the body has really helped as a as a diagnostic to you know like in your practice I mean I'm sure you have a million but you have one or two that you could just share with us sure um well I'll start by telling you my biggest mistake because you know you learn by your mistak so I I had um a man come to me and he was in very acute pain in his back right behind um his shoulders and he's like I just I'm in so much p pain and he had had surgery recently and I kept asking him questions but I missed the most obvious thing was that he was absolutely white he had no blood and it turned out they had that he was bleeding from the surgery and the blood was filling up his pericardium and I missed it because it was just in the beginning of my learning and you know nowadays if he walked through the door I would have seen it right away but that's why that's why we call the US practicing our voice that's right we have to learn you know sometimes the biggest thing you learn is by the biggest mistake you make and mean he lived he was fine they went in and repaired the damage the unsuccessful surgery but but that I'll never forget that you know you know I also remember a time that is that's really incredible and also that openness to share when we don't get it quite right you know I do I also agree with you there's so much learning in that you know we used to have at some of the early herb conferences we used to have a class actually on our mistakes you know like idea it was really great we have yeah because there was so much learning that I recall a story that you had told me or maybe Pat herself of when William was at your so do you want mind sharing that yeah so William lasas was teaching and I have that on videotape it's a horrible recording but there he is and he's going around the room as we're all in groups looking at each other and reading and he had taught us that the large intestine line comes down and then if it Forks it's a little more ser serious and then if a fork Rises up one side then the next and then it joins together and makes a little puffy Island that that's pathology and he very nonchalantly looked at that described the thing said that said it's a pathology and she went back to her doctor and she had just been to the doctor and complained about lethargy and you know pain maybe I don't even remember but definitely Lethy he just said oh you're in menopause it's like that is not the that's yeah so she insisted he'd do more diagnostic work and it turned out she had colon cancer because this little this little island that you get when it it can be cancer but there's some blockage for sure going on it may not be cancerous but you could have a tumor or you could have a prolapse it could be any number of other things another organ could be pressing on whatever but find out what's going on yeah yeah and she said that it saved her life you she had it it was fairly Advanced when she went back that second time but she said it was being at your class with William that really saved her life because she would not have G William this yeah yeah I I a pretty and then she went went on to uh Pat went on to do a lot of you know education about that as well you know it's a very well-known herbalist yeah so um you're also an accomplished artist you know and I and I know many of us are proud owners of your lithographs they're really studying works and your art has been featured in galleries throughout New England so I'm just can you share how art has also shaped your life and your herbal work yeah so I began um doing etchings back in 1974 and interestingly that was the same year I started my herbal pen so art and herbs have always overlapped and the theme of my art is primarily nature and pretty happy you know uh you know when I was born it was um you know my mom you know my mom said oh putam this is it's like living in a fairy tale and really no matter what's happened in my life I do have a sort of rose-colored glass um overall attitude I can get depressed but you know overall life is fabulous and the the career of art I really feel like I continued that it's just I did my artistic work on people you know it's like we'll smear them with with a little bit of Hawthorn and then you know it's like it's all energetically the same okay awesome yeah it's like art art and color heel music vibration right so why do I love jazz you know why do I have these concerts all the time because if I don't hear live music once a week I'm not as happy because that vibration heals yeah that's beautiful talking about jazz and music you know that that's one of the more recent healing gifts that you're offering to your community is hosting these you know in-house concerts out in your beautiful garden where people years yeah you've done it for 12 years and you have these really well-known Jazz musicians musicians and you you you have I've never been able to make it yet but I will but you have like what 30 or 40 people that come and sit in your backyard I can fit up to 50 people covid safe no less and I have permanent Furniture you don't have to bring anything but food and drink and a good attitude and you have to listen I don't like chitchat in my music you it's like yeah listen it's also very nice for the musicians you know to have that respectful listening yeah it's a really beautiful offering that you've created yeah so I know that you have many stories but is there um a particular story that you can tell tell when you saw plants you know work a miracle like a healing miracle I just love I call it witnessing for the plants you know like one of those times when you know a plant just did something miraculous for somebody or yourself I'll just tell my own story I think this time just because it's been so dramatic lately um so I had drama the past two years like big story I'm not going to tell that whole story here but essentially my heart uh it started with lightning when I was a little girl I was struck by lightning and um indirectly but nonetheless the charge came through me and that electrical jolt affected my heart but I didn't I didn't even remember that story because it was so normal for our family to be struck by [Laughter] lightning and and so lightning so we have electricity it did something to my heart and then if I when I look back over my medical history you know I've had like six unexplained cardiac events where you know I'd be totally normal and then I would lose I don't know 4 seconds six seconds where I short it out and I'd be on the ground without any memory or and you know people be walking along with me it's like where is she wow yeah could be scary yeah and then two years ago I just went into big apib and they couldn't regulate it for eight hours and it was scary and it and I nearly died and um so Hawthorne is the story Hawthorne has people have been tell my herbal friends the herbs have been telling me I have two hawor trees in my that I planted how many people plant two Hawthorne Trees when they're back here it's like there must have been oh and right next to it a Lyon oh Beau so yeah everything you need yeah I mean this huge Cedar Falls over and the little baby Hawthorne catches it and saves it from taking out my brand new huge deck for the musicians Hawthorne is always there protecting me it's like let me protect you so this spring now that I'm Healed I did actually have more electricity but in the medical version and they did a a cardiac ablation so it's burning Rings four rings of fire more fire um and when I went out and had all my soil and compost delivered there is a Haw tree growing in my front yard I did not plant it there and it was like 3 feet tall oh my God I know it's like oh you'll protect me now I have auth in in front and in back yeah you surrounded young plant and you know there are so many stories of the heart like Jim McDonald you know when I went to Scotland to help him when he had his heart drama do you mind sharing a little bit about that just just I love that story yeah yeah Thomas Easley calls Jim McDonald's had a heart attack and the voice says You must go and he was in he was in Ireland Scotland yeah he had the heart attack in Ireland went to Scotland passed out walking into the hospital entry um and then they put him into an induced coma for 30 so odd days in which time I had got my act together and then I went over to Scotland to help you know first Thomas went then Rosalie went then I went and then Stephen his best friend went so and we all were there when we could do the things we were best at that's perfect so what did I come with I came with a little box of herbs hawor then Yaro of course and Rose I didn't know I hated it and oh my goodness yeah I brought sprays because I'm in cardiac intensive care so a spray of white sage which is actually really good for conservation because it takes essentially hardly any Sage at all and a spray of sweet grass and I blessed the whole room you know I just walked in and again praying I I I arrived with my hands and my heart and your heart yeah and in my hands I sent all the prayers that came in every single night through Facebook there were people praying for him all over the planet and they would send me these beautiful messages and I would just offer them to him when I went in the morning and then I would massage him from head to foot going around I couldn't do the back of the bed and he's super long in way but every day I was there I would massage him and those muscles hadn't been used in 30 days I wish I'd done more time on his feet but um but it was it was the most I didn't care how I looked what I wore anything I would just come in as an empty vessel and channel all the prayers of the people and then I would ask his his doctor was a riot he I'd say well what's going on well he has a clot blah blah blah where is it and then I would write on on Facebook focus on this part of the heart send Yaro and then we go in the morning and the doctor say I don't know what happened but the clot is gone and then the next day I'd ask him and it so it got to the point where he was like okay today let's focus on this you know and that first day when we sprayed when I sprayed the room I always say we because I never felt alone um I turned around in the in the doorway all of the Intensive Care nurses were standing there like this I was so surprised they were all there and they said what did you just do the energy in the entire Ward just changed and I said I'm happy to teach so Mark know one thing that uh this story really illustrates and for those who are listening don't know Jim McDonald is a very beloved herbalist in our community who had a massive heart event when he was teaching and traveling a number of them and a number of Margie and several members that she mentioned of our community and others went over just to care for Jim because he you know he just really needed that love and support and care and the entire I would say in the United States there were really literally hundreds if not more of uh herbalists and people who knew Jim who pulled together resources and money and time to you know help he and his family and he's doing remarkably well he recovered from a a really a heart attack that they didn't think he would recover from but he came back and teaching there's a there's a great oh yeah he's back teaching yeah so I'll tell that too but you know Stephanie um the last event he had the doctor said well we'll unplug him from everything and clean him up a little and bring the kids in and she said what he said yeah you know we're we're not going to do the surgery and she goes you said he had a 4% chance of living yeah she said do the surgery he will live and it was like yes Stephanie oh awesome oh good that's such a great miracle well one of the things that I know that both for yourself uh in your own personal experience and then also with so many of your clients that you worked with you know you you Incorporated allopathic medicine with herbal medicine and so often you hear you know oh you can't do that or you know they're two ENT entirely different systems which they are but do you mind sharing a little of your philosophy know you work with both I mean I wouldn't be alive without alpath medicine you know I would have died when I was two of dehydration you know back in the old days so they would just chucked me into the forest um I had my appendix out I would not have lived with you know my appendix ruptured on the on the table so there's two well lightning but that no intervention there uh until later and that cardiac ablation saved my life I mean really so I'm I'm here I'm reborn um appendex you know so I've had lots of surgeries and you know Western medicine is really good at certain things like diagnostic tests I can't do a colonoscopy you know I mean some people may be able to psychically read things but you know Western medicine is really good at some testing and then some of it is but you know it's it's a big world and the the more doctors you actually work with where you respect them and they respect you that's where we have integration yes that's so wise yes and and you know I don't want to do everything myself and I don't know everything so you know if I don't know the answer to something I want to send people out to somebody who does it's very wise yeah I know it's it seems so odd to me that people have to think of these systems of as not being integrated or able to work together you know it's a little bit like politics these days I do have to I have to share with you though before we go on um there's a big thunder and lightning storm Marky yeah Brewing right as we're speaking there's Big Thunder happening so if any for any reason we get cut off it's because of the lightning and thunder and I I have to laugh because you were just talking about how yeah and the it's me it's the Flint we I'm surprised it isn't here lightning comes to us yeah well you know you've mentioned several plants that you know it sounds like you really rely on as your plant allies but I you know Yaro you've mentioned hawthor um do you want to just talk a little bit about that plant Ally relationship and also if you have any other plants that you would share what I've noticed in my own life is I have this huge herb closet full of plants I mean that goes it's 12 feet wide with gallon jars of herbs and how many plants do I use all the time regularly red clover raspberry Yaro cingula I love slippery El but I make people grow the tree um marshmallow leaf and and root CU I I like both parts of the plant Nettles of course I mean you know there are certain dandelion of course berock of course um but they you know when I moved onto this property there was nothing here it was hardack and it was just berock yellow do uh berock and mug wart those three are upset with it a rotor till the dust blew away there was not a single worm on the property you have like a jungle there it's like a just an incredible Jungle of plants that's remarkable yeah people say oh you're such a good Gardener it's like no I'm not I am not a gardener those are survivors you know I give them seaweed and and compost and fish heads but you know they they survive on their own tenacity yeah so I know you've made so many different products you know I've used a lot of your products I'm just wondering is there like a a favorite remedy that you have like yeah um well ride and glide you know my kind of famous my last my last wusband was such a great Namer of products we're still friends and he named that one riding Glide you you know lovely sexual lubricant lower lip balm and and he actually gave me names for all new products which I haven't had time to make on with men's names and they're super clever um so ride and glide I be I formulated that when um I had a bunch of clients that happens doesn't it where all of a sudden you have 10 people with the same thing so they all had cervical dysplasia so riding glass was really you know just something you could put into your vagina that would be nourishing so very high in uh wheat germ oil vitamin E fish oil uh evening premrose oil and then herbal oils of black kohos and Kula and wild yam and confrey because a lot of it it seemed at the same time uh women would have um irritation on the vaginal walls so it was painful to have intercourse and you know when you have cancer signs you know men are afraid to stick their little penis in there it's like there psychological elements as well and then I have essential oil of rose and and then for noncancerous issues more fun things like Sandalwood or pachuli or a rose geranium if you want more estrogens or lavender you know the you can only use things that are healthy internally but you know Sandalwood makes you want to rub it more so that's fun um and it's just a great lubricant you cannot use it with condoms and why is that I mean I wear it out and it will have a hole in it oh dear yeah it does break down then yeah the you've been telling some really incredible stories about herbs and and your life and but I'm I'm just want to ask you if you have any just a favorite story like if you were sitting around the campfire and telling a favorite herbal story do you have one that you would share with us it could be about anything by the way I think Yaro is I would have to tell my arrow story so I had um you know I live in a fishing town so I thought well I'll use the fishing net on the on the you know the wall of the open parts of the deck and tied it to trees and stuff and have the Claus climb up the fishing line well it was really ugly it did not look good at all and so I thought oh I'm cutting that down so so I took my brand new jack knife and went outside beautiful day sunny and I'm just cutting you know the Claus is gr around you have to cut pull it out from the little curly C cut cut cut and I got to the end and I was really tired and I cut and sliced oh ouch and there's a little scar here and it goes right along the tendon instead of right into the vein gold and I looked at it and I thought tendons do look just like Solomon Seal root and then I called for Gabriel and said run in and get the Yaro and he came out with Yaro tincture I I was a little unstable because it was really bleeding and I stayed where I was he ran in got the yo I put it on put couple squirts in my mouth and it stopped bleeding immediately I washed it out with yarao perfectly good antiseptic and then I used butterfly Band-Aids to and it's like the scar goes from there to there that's amazing it's amazing how many how many stories we all have about Yaro this very common herb you know found everywhere in the temperate regions of the world world and it's been such an ally really for like thousands of years yeah that's that's great and that's really one of its main you I mean it has so many main uses that's the other thing that's pretty astounding about it well I think about yo you know they used it to they would grinded up the leaves and flowers and fling it into their wounds at battles and I part of well I mean we were Pioneers back in the day you know when I was teaching at toughs there was an herbal Renaissance going on you know St John's war was on the cover of the New York Times on 60 Minutes it was on 60 Minutes they did a whole program on it yeah it wasn't New York Times it was a magazine I don't remember what it was but anyway I feel like we were warriors so yo um gives us a strength to go into battle to make change because we did make change in our time and I'm still making change and so are you yeah we're vitally alive because we're full of herbs that's that's a very interesting picture I love that it's so amazing too like as you're speaking this enormous Thunder is coming rolling in so I think we're going to be done soon but I had a few other a couple other questions I did want to just um ask you and one is when you were beginning your herbal work you know over 40 years ago just starting your practice Etc what particular challenges did you feel that you as a young herbalist had to face well as a young mom and a herbalist and you know I went through a lot of husbands so I was essentially even when I was married I was single you know that was the real truth and I think being little On The Fringe was challenging for my children more than for me oh okay because I wasn't normal they appreciate that now right I do now yeah now it's fine well I don't know they might think I'm a little I actually no I think now they think I'm a little too wild but I told them well I'm not a parent anymore I can do whatever I want there you go um so that was a challenge it was sort of the fitting into society part um but really I think the most important thing that I followed was listening to the encouraging words to move ahead and thank you because you know when did my book begin oh when you asked me to come and teach he said oh I want you to teach for the advanced program and could you bring a little a little something to hand out to people I don't know maybe 42 pages and that was that that was that was the beginning of the book yeah I still have that copy I still have that copy of the practicing herbalist yeah thank you but I think all of us if we listen to the words of a you have to hear your path if somebody saysi oh could you teach at the library that's a message Rippling out saying it's time for you to teach at the library it's time for you to reach these people or I want you to come and teach at the school or and then equally to hear the no messages no I won't do that knowing listening to the bell of Truth is really important that's thank you yeah so what do you thinking what do you think are some of the challenges facing herbalism today or herbalist today you know they they're really entirely different than when we were starting so yeah what do you what do you see as maybe some of what herbalist are having to face today that is unique or different my perspective is people are studying too much with too many people and not applying the knowledge well you okay it's like yeah take a course but then apply it do something with it yeah yeah if you just keep reading books and never doing anything you're not a herbalist that was a great answer so um you know and I wanted to ask you about your book The practicing herbalist I know it's considered really one of the best references for practicing herbalist and for anyone who wants to go into practice it has so so much information and it I think it's now in its fifth printing no fourth it's Fourth printing okay I know this has been a labor of love for you and youve really poured your life teachings in this book can you just share with a little bit about the book and the process for writing it yeah the purpose was um to I wish I'd had a course on business I wish I had been able to set up you know know how to set up my office and know how to do accounting and know how this that and the other you know how to run a business and I had to teach myself how to do all that or you know I had an accountant who taught me how to do it and then another accountant would taught me how to do more but I just thought if I put it all in one place what I've learned not that I know everything but at least I know how I did it and I am successful um that that would help everyone else and then of course the diagnostic information is Williams teaching so that's super valuable and then I did um an intake and my intake is very fluid you know it changes all the time but just examples and it's fun because you get to have a question and I might tell a story or I might say what the next five questions would be and that part I'm actually rewriting the whole thing and probably going to figure out some way to offer it to everyone because the person who did the compilation put the wrong chapter in I know so whatever bonus um yeah so intake and vitamins and minerals and how to use that's Treasure Trove of information yeah really an incredible work and they can they can get it from your website they can go to your website and get it there yeah you know I I did want to ask you one other thing Margie because as a practicing herbalist who's run a very busy practice for many years in a country that's basically illegal to practice medicine how did you balance that rebelling re rebelling you just did your work yeah I just did my work and one of my favorite stories is when a a man appeared with stage four cancer with his daughter and you know right away asked you know what is the purpose of your visit blah blah blah what what is your occupation I'm a person what is it called personal liabilities lawyer like the ones and I was like oh you know if I ever get sued it'll be this one nothing happened and I just believe I'm on the right path and I don't the truth is I'm an incredible Optimist and I always believe people have good intentions even when I get screwed sometimes I still believe in people no matter what happens because I I basically that's a great way you know just you do what you what you're called to do you know and you do it with the most integrity and the most love that's like the gift we have to offer to the world yeah so as an herbalist like what do you feel your greatest you've done so much but I'm just wondering what you personally feel like your greatest accomplishment has been in your herbal work I'm sure your greatest accomplishments have been your two children but in your herbal work in my herbal work I I'd say the book is my legacy you know even when I'm gone I have a book executor who will keep it going so I think tangibly that is my greatest accomplishment my second is being present to help Jim McDonald because I think that was a m a miracle that's beautiful thank you so much I'm going to kiss you goodbye and say [Music] goodbye I am thankful to be here I am thankful to be [Music] here
