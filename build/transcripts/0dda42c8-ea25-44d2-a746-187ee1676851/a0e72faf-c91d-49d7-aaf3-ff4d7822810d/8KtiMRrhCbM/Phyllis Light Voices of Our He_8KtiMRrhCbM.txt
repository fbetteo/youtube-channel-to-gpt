hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant and healing stories and I felt that

looking forward to this conversation thanks for having me this is an important and exciting work that you're doing thank you thank you con yeah so let's start with your childhood you know I've heard some of your incredible stories um and I know that you know growing up in the world South really not only influenced your life of course but also your your healing work and your work with herbs so do you mind just sharing with our listeners just a little a little bit about that your you know a little your childhood and you know well um you know I grew up and uh in a time period of kind of transition between what we call down here the Old South and the new South um and so I was in that transitional time period where there was still a lot of poverty and um people were still growing cotton and cotton was still the primary agricultural so like my mom's dad uh was a sharecropper so on my mom's side of the family I grew up in Cotton Fields ho and cotton chopping we called it choing cotton not ho and cotton chopping cotton and uh um picking cotton or pulling bowls and um you know that was my early life um hunting my mom's dad you know primarily was food was wild meat and he also made a little extra money um selling his hunting you know product you know whether it was rabbit or squirrel or deer to uh other people and um you know gardening was huge and on my dad's side of the family it was a little bit different we grew up in the woods and Gathering wild plants and products from the wood s for resale and to use for food and medicine so it was all about kind of foraging and it's still because you're so poor you don't have anything else you know like my mom grew up in a cabin um that you had to walk a quarter of a mile to get water from the spring it had no windows they had oil cloth they rolled up and rolled down the floor was dirt and if they were lucky they might find um um on the side of the road where somebody had pulled out a no bit of carpenting or something out of their house and put down I mean this was poverty right yeah and so both sets of parents and grandparents this had been their life and didn't they didn't know anything different I mean it's just the way things were you know so I grew up going yeah we're poor but so what everybody else is poor too you know no inside Plumbing um but that was just our community so nobody thought anything about it so on my dad side the family we hunted jining and pink root and whatever an herb company might be willing to buy you know and so every year we got a list from Chattanooga herb company because they would buy stuff and from Campbell herb company in Gurley Alabama and so uh my uncle he was the businessman my uncle way of the family um every year would get together with the folks at Campbell herb company and they would give us a list we need Jing we need this we need you know whatever was needed and we foraged that but um my grandmother was also um had been uh she had kind of retired from a lot of this by the time I knew her because she was getting on up in years by the time I got old enough to do stuff in her younger days she had been herbalist Midwife for this whole community and was still remembered as such and so people would still come and go do you have any herb for this or herb for that so you know this is kind of like some of my early years we kind of rotated between the cotton field and the farm and the woods you know and managed to um e out a Liv and and my dad also did odd jobs for people and construction work whenever anybody was building uh anything sing around you know usually could get on as a carpenter for a while so that was just kind of our life and we just kind of played it by ear you know as far as money went um you know I remember us not having any inside walls in our house um because we couldn't afford to finish the house and my parents couldn't so my mom just Tung blankets and quilts to separate rooms because it was the studs were there right but but over time you know um and work um working my mom at offseason from the cotton fields um cleaned other people's houses she was a what we would call domestic these days but she was a housekeeper um and um a Shor order cook in a restaurant you know so everybody did a lot of different things to make a 11on and a big part of that was what can we find in the woods or what is on the farm Etc so so those were my really early days and like I say it was a transition time period um between the Old South which was the the Jim Crow South where there was a lot of racial Strife going on you know I can remember roadblocks by the KKK and even if you had a quarter you were scared to death not to give them a quarter in their bucket because you never know what was going to happen um how they might come after you for whether you were um uh black or Native American they didn't care you know uh and those were kind of like the only um kind of different cultures in my area it wasn't until much later that Latinos started coming into my area so you were either black brown somewhere in between or white and and it was that transition yeah such a childhood you know and so much to be grateful for too you know like learning the hard value of hard work and you know knowing what it's like to have nothing and still you know you you came from such a wonderful family as far as people loving and caring for each other you know and you know that that tradition and it also just I know really really deeply impacted your your view of herbalism and health and healing you know yeah number one it had to be really practical right yeah right you know it had to work if it didn't work you don't need it right because it was like this is all people had um you just couldn't afford to go to the doctor um nobody had of course this was pre- Insurance um era nobody could have afforded it down there anyway I mean right you know that's a whole another thing yeah I think it's wonderful also that you still you know you've chosen to to stay in the South it's like your home you've been there your whole life and still live in I if I remember when I was visiting you said that this was a town that you grew up in right or very right it's the town I was born you know in I was actually born down this street in the old hospital which is now retail allet but yes I stayed in my area uh and one reason is the abundance of plants I mean where could I go with I mean Alabama is the fourth state in the continental United States um for plant diversity that's amazing yeah it is I mean there are over 4,000 species of plants here um and you know everybody still used herbs herbalism never died in parts of the South so and never died in my area you were just carrying on your grandmother's work because you're you're still not only the community herb list your work has expanded out to the entire nation actually you know but by you know by what the teachings that you've brought but yeah so you've seen a lot of changes you sort of were mentioning some of those in this house but also as far as medicine both herbal and you know allopathic medicine goes can you talk a little about how those changes have impacted the health of people in the South yeah sometimes worse um people there are a a tremendous number of people in the South who still don't have access to regular health care because poverty and because they don't have insurance and um so there that's still there maybe not as much as in previous years um there are still like it's an area where people don't typically seek out a lot of higher education um maybe don't even make it through high school so that really hasn't changed um you know it's an area where there's a lot of recreational drug use used to the detriment not as bad as it used to be but bad enough you know o the opioid crisis in the South and the South was the region it hit the worst um was there the meth crisis oh I mean the next Mountain over they did a documentary called meth Mountain um that aired on TV um so you know that has been there people at least in my time period had a garden if you were poor you had a garden now if you're poor you you get food stamps and go to McDonald's um you know so quality of food um has just gone downhill and that compensated for a lot at you know back when when people actually had Gardens and got good food in their bodies and knew how to cook people don't know how to cook anymore you know it's like a big deal you know it's cheaper to eat fast food so who Cooks nobody there's that um also the internet has greatly impacted herbalism and health period for everybody because now we have do internet and people will come and say oh I saw in the internet that if I have this situation that I should be taking this herb uh can what do you think you know can I get some and I'm like well let's talk about that for a minute that might not even be the correct her you know let tell me what's going on with you so there's a lot a lot more um self treatment without personal responsibility if I said that correctly yeah yeah no you did yeah so that's happening and then there's something that I think has been in the South forever and that is this kind of fatalistic view of health and the body and I hear it all all the time well something's going to kill me it might as well be this you know it's like the doctor told me I needed to quit smoking well something's going to kill me and there's that are I've got diabetes I don't want to do my medicine something's gonna kill me I guess this will be it or or God's not GNA bring me home until it's my time so I can do what I want to with my body um because I'm just going to live as long as God lets me live anyway and I'm like no you know how about quality of life Al long longevity um so that is still kind of a rampant view of life it is phis you know it also that same philosophy also goes a lot on people's view of the earth do you know that yes like it kind of ties into that same thing like you know well God is going to save us all when it's our time so doesn't really matter what happens here you know so it kind of when you were saying that because I know that's also been a real focus of yours is just you know environmental health and the wellbeing of the planet and how our own health is so tied into it we'll talk about that a little bit later Well you certainly have your work cut out for you there well you know I think it's not uncommon all this stuff in rural areas all around the country I mean I think lesso maybe in City so we have like City urbanism and Country urbanism and you know so I think that can kind of be all the things I said you know I see in the midwest I see it in Northern California in the country I mean wherever there's rural area I think we get more of this this philosophy do do you have a do you have you thought about why that might be just curious why that would be well I I do think education plays a role in understanding how the Body Works which is why I have had a great focus on understanding the physiology of the body not just the herbs but you know what what is diabet what's happening in your body with diabetes what happens when you like drink like a sailor and fall down drunk what do you think's happening in your body you know but you know in an educational non um threatening way I don't want to make people defensive but but I do want to maybe explain a little how things work in the body and then it's their choice right you're very educated in that it's wonderful you know it also might be because uh you know you have less of a fatalistic view if you feel you have more control or opportunities you know yeah difference that might be part of it too like yeah you know so yeah so I wanted to talk a little bit about a little bit about your book but also how you have made it your life work to you know bring Southern folk medicine out to the rest of the world as a really valuable system of healing I remember one time I had invited you to be one of the you know main speakers one of the featured speakers at the international herb Symposium which is really considered to be one of the most prestigious you know events in the world really for Herbal education and herbal medicine and you you know you were very very clear that you wanted to talk talk about southern folk medicine and you explained to me I remember at that time that you know it was such an important system in America and it just needed to be and I at that time I really didn't realize you know it was like really through your education I began to understand what an important system it was of its own so if you don't mind just sharing a little bit about you know about your work of reading Southern folk medicine out Southern Appalachian you call but really it's really that whole entire South right right it's the whole entire South right I know it's a huge topic but just some insights into it and its importance in you know maybe what makes it unique and its importance in modern medicine you know herbal medicine today okay um well one of the things that that makes it unique um is that the South was the only area of the country um other than Native Americans that developed the folk medicine that continued over an extended time period and was codified and passed on so U many people were using the same philosophy and principles whether they were in Alabama or Georgia or or Tennessee or North Carolina um these principles got shared so we have a a large extent of land mass and population using the same principles and that is unique in the United States that developed here that developed in this country um from from the fusion of cultures coming together and the necessity of survival um so we have Native American Plant use and because wherever you originated what country you originated in if it wasn't here you're using native plants or you brought plants with you so Native American Plant use and some Native American philosophies meets Europe and the humoral system and the humors uh meets um some philosophies and spiritual healing practices from Africa and it's just really unique and now that potential also it's Unique to Mexico too and actually I've spent a lot of time over the years discussing the southern F system with the now Mexican folk system where you had the Spanish met the natives met Europe you know kind of the similar Fusion but we have different plants and also um in Mexico you have more of the the Incan Aztec um spiritual influence that remains where in the South you had Cherokee Creek um simol or you know various um tribes and each little area kind of had their own tribe their own Regional plant and their own philosophy so so one Native American tribe might have totally different approach than in other but there was some commonalities in across the United States still so I that is unique and the South was settled from the Gulf up and so it was settled about a hundred years before the Plymouth Rock thing happened so the pilgrims had not landed at Plymouth Rock yet which is what our history books tell us is when everything started right um it' been going on in the south in Alabama and Louisiana parts of Texas T Tennessee areas of Georgia and definitely Florida for about 100 years there's a big difference between 1492 which is Columbus because this is you know this is where he came the South not the Northeast and the pilgrims were were more like I can't remember the date but it was like 15 1592 or something 15 literally it's almost 100 years the Northeast became the history that everybody looks at as the country you know yeah right but that wasn't that was just the the little area up there in part of the 13th colge which was all around the Sea Coast the Atlantic coast right um but the Native Americans by that point in time 100 years down the road something like 85 or 90% of the Native Americans in the South had already died from European diseases it was a decimation and for their survival um there was a lot of inter Maran started taking place between Native Americans and Spanish and Native Americans and whites and there were a few isolated areas where Native Americans just kind of like Native Americans right but this is why the south in the early days was really kind of like already fusing it was like survival everybody's survival kind of depended on it and so here the folk medicine developed right right and we're moving on toward 500 years of this being here yeah it's amazing yeah so no other place in the United States other than strictly Native American can say that and so over time it became codified um and the information was shared around in the area because the South has always been a little isolated yeah you know and you know the Civil War isolated the South even further Plantation living life isolated the South poor white people um very isolated in the South uh you know the Great Depression further isolated the South technically the the South did not recover from the Civil War and the devastation because all the battles were here right right and the damage to the land in the economics it was like 1980 something before the South had recovered so this poverty this isolation was horrible but it allowed this foke medicine amongst the poor white blacks and Native Americans to flourish you know and grow and be shared so it is unique it is a unique situation is it still valued in the South that the The herbal tradition somewhat I mean it was kind of lost value in the 1990s in the early 2000s there was still like some some people like Tommy bass who had a big following who was one of my herbal teachers he lived about an hour from here you know midwives had been outlawed by that time so now they're legal again um here so there was like this shift now the government moved into our area and many parts of the South John F Kennedy and then later also um Johnson and then Carter as president put money into bringing the South um up in line with the rest of the country and so government jobs became more abundant now you have insurance or the opportunity to buy insurance and all the subcontracting that goes with your government jobs Aid my grandparents didn't have electricity uh my mother didn't have electricity but then the government came in and created dams along the rivers and so there was this real kind of like FDR huge amount of money put into the South um to bring the South up to the educational and um like just lifestyle living area that was common in other parts of country and now it's still not totally there in parts of the South and truthly some people are like just fine I I don't want that government a right um that's the other thing I don't want the government in my life I don't want government aid but herbalism kind of fell to the Wayside there for a whole generation but then now it's like everybody is wanting it again I mean it's like super everywhere now you know everybody's foraging everybody's Gathering plants out their yard it's back to kind of like the way it was when I was growing up it's it's made that pendulum swing you know yeah I wanted to mention this just amazing book which I had the great honor to write the forward for thank you so much I I actually love this book and I I would say that it's really recommended reading for anybody interested in herbalism at all but one of the things so there's a lot about it in herbs but about herbs of course and the codifying which I'd like you to explain that term in a minute but also the other thing I love about this book is you get the Untold History of the United States through the you know there's there's so much history in here that ties in to the use of plants you know really all around the world but definitely you see it really in the South so yeah I don't know if there's a quick story that you want to just mention about that just maybe one quick little vignette of the history that is so often not told well be because the victors write history right founding fathers up in the Northeast were this History of the United States and it's White History which ended up extending across the whole country in one form or the other but for people who were living in the areas it wasn't really totally what happened um I'm not saying there's mistruth there but it's not the whole story let's say that it's not the whole story that's a nice way of saying it yes yeah there the whole concept of land ownership in the United States in the early days um was based on the concept of land ownership in Europe um and that just the whole thing of status and class came over here but manifested in kind of different ways um but but it was still there like the plantation system in the South was brought by the English from their from their experimentation uh in Ireland of trying to get rid of the Irish trying to decimate the Irish population because they wanted to take over their land so they would just kind of marched in took over whole Villages and towns and and lands um and castles and uh then started trying to get it rid of the Irish because we want we don't want you here we want to bring over our the third son of this Earl to run this place um because he can't have his own spot and so they developed indited servitude you know massive amounts of Irish came to the islands and the Caribbean islands for for many years was the landing point for anybody from Europe which is why um you know Pirates of the Caribbean kind of thing why there was so much pirating going on too it was everybody came through there so massive amounts of India CH ship slavery I mean all this was taking place but but nobody is really looking about why it is it's more like well that's just the way it had to be no it didn't it didn't have to be that way right um it could have been a totally different way um but you know the English were were made a a business out of it being that way and here and in India yeah and in Australia I mean everywhere that Canada it they made a business out of it um and it's important to note it was a business and kind of England developed the modern Corporation as we know it but instead of stockholders it was the company joined with the monarchy so you know the queen or King got their share granted land Deeds status but there was a company there too so like in India it was the British Tea Company but it was this same thing um you know that and that was happening all over the South and it's just not a history that anybody cares to look at is like this is how it got started this is why it got started and it was just all about money with slavery right yeah right it was just about money I think I found that I you know like I found the herbal information so valuable in here I just as I said you know it's primarily herbal information but really found the history you you've done a lot of research you also live it you're there living it you know it um but it's well research it's got tons of great footnotes it's just fabulous book well thank you so um let's talk about the plants a little bit I know you've had such a rich and wonderful life with the plants and I always love to hear those um those aha moments you know like either when you just felt the plants calling to you or you you know you were saved by the plants if you if you have a story of just just something that jumps out of you of one of those aha moments I guess my biggest I have two one American Jin saying and one in false unicorn or um uh American Jen saying is you know my family and it was a family event like my grandfather my dad me my brothers whoever wanted to go great aunts and uncles my dads brothers and sisters you know my and my grandfather's brother there might be 10 of us going J saying honey in the woods um yeah I mean it really was the family thing it was a it it's like what the family had already always done uh and well known and um they had negotiated my family had negotiated um with land owners to be able to walk their land legally and GA plants you know because my family didn't own land so we were at you know always had to be on somebody else's land one AA moment for me personally was when my dad said well you've got to find the Gin snc by yourself because up until this time it was like my great aunt would go hey there's some jinang over there go dig it you know and point it out to me and I'm just over there digging green plants or I'm running around in the woods doing other stuff and not even really looking at plants you know how little kids are right I was like I'm 10 I'm 12 I don't want to be digging plants oh let go climb a tree or you know that sort of stuff um but when I was a teenager my my dad took me out in the woods just me and him and said uh you got to find it by yourself you know it it's up to you you got to find it and so we went actually to a piece of land I'd never been to before and it was a little um it was a little um gourge kind of and there was running water and a tiny waterfall and there were just you know a lot of plants all around and there was no Trail I mean we were making our way through the woods there was no over rolled bed nothing right just woods and of course you're and here you're constantly on the outlook for snakes to you um so we're we're you know especially rattlesnakes when you're hunting Jin seeing in the fall so you have to be on the lookout um and so my dad was a great reader of westerns the paperback Western he probably had a thousand I don't know how many he had he almost always had one in his truck in his hand in his back pocket Zang gray um oh yeah say grade gosh um so um my dad took me to this mid of woods and he said from that rock over there to that tree over there down to the creek to where I'm sitting there are you know some Jens sang plants you've got to pick them out and he pulled out that paperback book and he sat down at the base of the tree and he started reading and I'm like standing there going what you know because it's kind of an area of the woods where everything is knee high and green um right and like how do I how do I find it so I'm walking around I'm walking around I'm looking I've been looking and I'm I look at him because time is passing and I I said to him are you sure there's gensing plants here and he was like yeah and my dad ate what he called dinner um we call lunch but dinner was the no meal supper was the evening meal um at 11 o'clock every day like clockwork because he had been he had breakfast at 6 11 o' he ready for dinner dinner right and um he so he said well you better hurry up because your mama's cooking dinner and she will be mad if we're late and she would she wanted us walking in the door when the food went on the table Yeah because it was a full meal it was vegetables meat cornbread it was every you know it was a full meal and so I was I was getting really really frustrated and I was getting resentful a little bit with my frustration and then I just I I just took a moment and I just like Stood Still and I just let out a breath and I closed my eyes and I just started listening to the sounds of the forest and I could hear the birds and I could hear the water I could hear squirrels in the trees I could hear animal that I didn't even know what they were but I could hear noises you know and but what really struck me was the sound of the water kind of moving over some rocks and a and a kind of Little Creek that went into the to the bigger Creek and uh I just stood there and then when I opened my eyes it was like I had it was like while while I was standing there in the silence just being and not trying to force it just being part of the process it was like I moved into this different almost meditative state of joining and when I opened my eyes it was like the Gin sing plants were just kind of outlined and light and I was like here's one here's one here's one here's one here's one and my dad being raised with some Native American ancestry stood up said okay well let's go home and eat dinner put his put his book in his back pocket and started back through the woods and I'm like okay but that's the way he taught that's way my grandmother taught you did your job you don't get any praise praise no this was the expectation nobody's gonna you know it was just it's a different way of teaching oh yeah right and he just headed off the woods and I went trotting behind them um and that was it was it but it was that moment and it was a teaching that taking a moment moving into the land hearing everything that I've carried forward to me with me forever um I remember one time at um an herb conference at a plant walk um I wasn't teaching it I was following I was a part of another you know the group and everybody went walking into the woods and I stood there for a moment and I listened and they said aren't you coming and I said nope there's sugars in there everybody came out with sugars like hours later people are going like CH I got sugars all over me and on yeah not me uh because I listened could you listen I listened and I'm like nope and that little thought just came in um one time I was out in the woods and I was I was looking for a plant I didn't know what I was looking for because sometimes you know when somebody is sick are are you feel like there's a plant that's missing and you can't quite get it um you can research but that's the not the knowing so it's the knowhow I seek um oh yeah right so I was just walking out in the woods and I just did this standing there and what connected for just that minute and uh opened my eyes and started moving and there was false unicorn horn In Bloom the ploe up and leaning over the only spot in the whole Forest where light Shone directly on it it was just illuminated and I was like okay I get sh bumps even thinking about that one um I was like that moment of quietness I always seek um with a land and I try to seek it in other aspects of my life but it doesn't quite come so easily dealing with family sometimes or dealing with clients or dealing with you know the rest of the world all right have to work a little harder to get that um but I think because of that early teaching from my dad when I'm moving into the land it's now like a breath it's almost instantaneous thank you phas I that story is such an incredibly powerful story because it really is the heart of really connecting with the plants you know and and all the magic that happens when we do that you know it's like you're right it's not not learning from the head it's really learning from your heart yeah yes it you have some amazing teachers you know like your grandmother and your father you know were really powerful and I know that you studied with other Elders is there any teacher or teachers that particularly influenced your work or I guess I would have to say um Tommy bass influenced my work greatly um you know he he was he died in 1996 um so um I was quite young and my grandmother already died and you know and I was just kind of like feel in my way and my my dad could only take me so far and then Tommy had um definitely Southern folk medicine point of view on things and this is the only thing he had done his whole life and uh he really helped keep Southern folk medicine alive in our part of the world too um he um he taught me uh a different way of kind of like not looking at the plants he he didn't have that like native approach like of quietness like my dad dad did um but he had more of a u body system approach that he had been taught very early on um and and you know like this herb is good for the liver this herb you know so my my grandparents and uh my dad didn't have that and they were more looking at like these patterns of dysfunction in the body and you explain what's wrong and my grandmother was like oh that's that's like oh my grandmother would be like uh and I've heard my dad say something similar somebody say I have a stomach ache and my grandmother would would go do it heart and and they would go yeah and she' go does it feel like there's a squirrel in there crawling around or you know or or does it feel does it feel like there's a snake moving around in there winding its way through she related everything back to animals and the land but it was kind of like in this whole area people people lived with the land live with the seasons live with the animals and people yeah squirrels do this climbing up the trees yeah it feels like a squirrel was climbing my gut ton now you know so I learned that and um I'm G make interesting topic of conversation sometime but um Tommy was like had been taught a little differently uh his parents had been herbalist from England so they were seeped in the humoral system but they had Tommy was born here and they had had immigrated really early um in their life but they brought that English system with them and then Tommy had worked and studied with uh Miss Molly Kirby called Aunt Molly Molly Kirby in the black community at the foot of the mountain where they lived and he had studied and worked with her and he helped gather herbs in the woods for her because she'd gotten just where she couldn't climb up and down the hills anymore mountains anymore together so he he learned from her and then he was just so it was like this different system so people would come to see Tommy and lots of people came to see Tommy I mean again a year he might do a thousand or 2,000 or three see 3,000 people it was huge seriously really seriously lots of people um and and they would come like on a Sunday afternoon after church and I'd be there he'd be there and people would pull up in his yard because he lived in a shack and there were old refrigerators old stoves old bicycles I mean it was he didn't mow everything was grown up I mean you would most people would be like I don't even know if I want to drive into this place or not let's let's get herbs from this person um but he spent all his time drying herbs digging herbs that kind of thing all right um so anyway people would come and say you know my stomach hurts and he would go show me where does it hurt point to where it hurts right and they would point and then he would go well um you got acid coming up your throat you know so he had like this different view of this pattern of dysfunction not really you know my grandmother had the animals and kind of like this common language folk language of the land Tommy had this humoral system um the old English hore system kind of met the Black Folk medicine he just asked different questions so that was different and most people didn't I mean in 15 or 20 minutes Tommy was like oh you need this herb and we'd send people on his way or he'd say let me put together this formula for you and you come back and get it tomorrow or if you want to sit over there and wait while I see somebody else you know me or Daryl or somebody put together the formula and then gave to them um so it was just a it was a different approach and so it was kind of based on a different background too so he was incredibly effective I mean he really really helped people with you were it's such a special privilege I always think you know my one of my elders was learning from Juliet de barley Le and I kind of think of Tommy bass as the you know the kind of on the same equivalent you know he was renowned for his work and um just yeah such a great honor that you that you knew him as well as you did I mean worked very closely with him for a long time yes I did I did there's a great book about him as well I forget the title of it but if you know if anybody's interested do you know the name of um the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill published two books on Tommy I highly suggest them both one of them is uh a reference guide to Medicinal plant reference God to Medical plants and it's all the huh it's big it's big um where the researchers went through and um they interviewed Tommy and they wrote down how he used the plant and then they would they come back and say how Co paper used the plant and then they they would say how what they found out in science so it's really a neat one to have yeah yeah that's fascinating yeah yeah and then there's this book um they also published yeah that great trying to give ease yeah and this is beautiful it's very beautiful and it's about Tommy's life his personal history and how he uses plants and it has his formulas in it so they're they go well together so if anybody is interested those are my those are two really good books about Tommy that's great honey yeah uh so you know I wanted to ask you also just because I I have been wanting to ask you you know it's you were um after the Hurricane Katrina which was was so you know just a Devastation for so many thousands of people really for the whole nation but definitely in that area it was just a one of the great tragedies but you were supervising the supervising herbalist at the Common Ground health clinic in New Orleans right after that would you just share a little bit about that experience and it was for two years I was there for two years um and there were four wonderful herbal women there um also um there was um oh gosh I'll have to give you names later you know I know these people like the off the tip of my tongue and and my mind went blank um immediately it'll pop in don't worry yes it'll it'll come in you know these things always do because it's been a lot of years um yeah it's been a lot of years yeah a lot of years but when I first started heading to New Orleans um the bridge at Lake I have to Cross Lake pona train uh which is like this huge jant Lake I mean it's almost like it's huge um and I was driving over a floating Bridge because the bridge I know had been wiped out and I'm driving on it and it's dark it's night and it's sedy and I was like oh my God if I know this I'm not sure I would have okay you know it was like a really kind of yeah but that's how devastated everything was and for two years um after Hurricane Katrina because of the the devastation the state of New Orleans suspended normal medical practices so we could start and I was not the person that started it and I would have to get you um a full list of all the people that started it a nurse herbalist began it I can't think of her name in a mosque in New Orleans in alers New Orleans and then she had to leave and then the Common Ground moved into its own special building out of the mosque and this all happened within just a a few weeks this was like one week to the next week right and then there were four herbalist um katcha Rachel Amy and Jennifer hey good getting old um started working there uh seven song came and did some work there and then I was there and um the uh board because there is a an MD and he's a Clinical Director there's a nurse practitioner there's a social worker there's a massage therapist there's an occupational therapist there's a chiropractor there's an acup punctures that's awesome it was it was amazing um and 99.9% of the people who initially in the early days were coming to the clinic were um homeless um because everything they had had been destroyed they were sleeping out of the cars being denied government Aid I can get on this soap box about the government and so much about what happened after or after Katrina other parts of the country were kind of going eh not a big deal you had to be there you know uh violence was Rampage you did not go out by yourself at night you had to go out in groups um there was no fresh food there was no water um oh I remember the first time I was down there and and we tried to get to a grocery store which was Far Far you know not in the area and there was no no public transportation and a lot of people no longer had vehicles and how are you going to cross this other bridge to get this other part of New Orleans where there's a grocery store that they're actually bringing groceries into so um it was horrendous it was like a third world country disaster and a just wasn't coming in various herbal groups and organization um donated product and I was a um still connected to Clayton college at that time so I was just taking all kinds of stuff we were making stuff uh and almost everybody that came in like I say was poor um had lost so much of what they own and the majority of them were black because it was a it was a poor black community to start with and so it was just it was a really hard time um but but everybody did great work I mean it was like amazing work and it was like this training on this other level and be because I was a registered herbalist with the herbal Guild um and that was an important thing for the medical board to have going to have an herbalist they have to be at least certified in some way and so it was a big training uh h on this other level about what a disaster could really be like in this country and I opening to happens in a disaster with the government at that time period in homeland security and oh Fe various government agencies is it was like oh FEMA trailers that were poisoning everybody I mean I could go on and on how how the mayor of New Orleans and you know he ended up in jail was demolishing areas in the black community just tearing down building and structures so that they could build something new and get gentrifi it was there was so much politics going on but we were there doing good herbal work and helped so many people in spot of this political situation trying to do try to help folks the best we could PTSD people so many people had PTSD from the hurricane from losing everything from um the government how the government treated everybody PTSD and diabetes and high blood pressure I mean can't get their medicine diabetic and can't get their medicine medicines weren't coming in you know yeah that's pretty amazing I have been really proud of the herbal Community these last 10 or 15 years how almost every major emergency you know the herbalists have set have come in and set up clinics you know after the Pulse Nightclub shooting at Standing Rock you know they they go in and really uh have been working with the medical teams and with other healers like you were saying to create like you know like usually very all free and you know readily available medicines that people can be using it's been inspiring to see that I feel and I think that Common Ground was one of the first examples of that the the clinic in Katrina yeah I remember I was in the airport at Providence coming back from the north east of women's herb conference I'm standing in the airport in Providence waiting on my connecting flight um and I'm watching the weather giant weather thing giant screen TV and I'm looking at this hurricane and they saying category five and I knew I knew in my gut at that moment because it was hadn't hit yet it was still coming in that was Katrina that was Katrina oh my goodness yeah yeah and I knew and as soon as I got home I started putting stuff together I knew that I was going to be called in some way or I was going to volunteer and I immediately started like this is happening thank so much all your good work yeah so is there a um is there like a I know there is so I I think I just want you to share like one of those stories where you have witnessed you borne witness to an herb like either you know kind of doing its Miracle either on you like some uh like a time when it really healed you or somebody else I always love those stories you know I call it bearing witness for the plants yes and it it does doesn't it might be an odd example but it was like for a person who did not believe right well I'm not going to do that orb it's not going to do any good anyway so this person had herpes in their eye which is really devastating painful and you can't have light touching your eye you have to have injections in your eye and there been going and getting these injections they had eye patches all this stuff was happening and it just came to me one day when I was talking with this person and I said have you tried St John's workart and they said herbs are not going to touch this herbs are not going to do any good against this and I saidwell you never know you try and if it doesn't work it's not going to hurt you you know and just to appease me more than anything they were like okay and I said but I'm not putting it in my eye I'm not putting an herb in my eye because yeah they read my mind I was thinking I'll make a decoction we'll do a little wash and and I was like no okay and I had some St John's wart tinure which is this beautiful red color right which to me is always a signature of blood like this is going to get into the blood and so I said okay I've got some tincture and um so they were like well how do I take it I thought you know in this situation I feel like smaller dose would be better than a bigger dose and I said well we could put a few drops in some water you can drink it or you can just put it on your tongue and they were like okay put in some water and I did I got some warm water bought a four of cup and I put maybe maybe eight or nine drops of St John's wart and uh the warm water in the tin you know and they chugged it down um in 20 minutes their eye had stopped watering um they were blinking they tly raised up the Pat and did this and they went I can see they went back to the doctor like the next day because they had no problem the herpes was G herpes was gone it did not come back oh yeah and that's been like 15 years no return yeah that's a that's amazing it was so amazing because they weren't expecting it didn't believe in it you know so folks you don't have to believe in a plant for it to work yeah so true they just said do their work for so long right they're going to do it no matter what you know James Duke um Dr James Duke just love that man um he said we were in a conversation once and we were talking about the evolution of plants on this Earth and we you know we were just talking about I said yeah you know it doesn't matter what your religious belief system is whether it's the Bible or Evolution the plants got here first and we were just talking about that right and he saidwell I'm going to take that a step further and I said yeah what and he said they were here first and they of course were here for food and medicine but all the phytochemicals within the plant and he took it he was a scientist you know he was a USDA scientist he said we as far back as you want to go I mean evolve with the photochemicals in that plant all right and I it was something I thought I knew but the way taking it down to this chemistry level this B biology level and I was like he's totally right he's totally right if this is all you have to eat right of these plants it's like over time over a time period whatever is in the plant is automatically going to have a place in our body right and and he also said you was part of that conversation he said and this is why with our medicinal plants not our poisonous plants and he made a a difference there but the plants that heal our liver welcomes them that's a beautiful way of saying it yeah yeah he did um he said our liver welcom them knows exactly how to break them down and put them around their body to release them into the bloodstream he said when you have a synthetic drug our liver does not know what to do with that it can't break it down which is why with some drugs people have to get liver enzyme test every six weeks because it's damaging their Li and he said healing plants don't do that because we evolved with them and our liver welcomes them and I was like what a great way to take it down to this science level this physiological level and I loved it and I quoted him a zillion times on that you know so you don't have to to believe a plant will work they evolved to do their job and our liver evolved along with us over thousands of years to welcome it to do its job that's that's quotable right there F do you have uh I know you do your your favorite plant allies or Ally you those plants that always show up for you they show up because they just love you um you know I would say American jining is in that list but blue vervan and we have our own native species blue veran where I live uh verbina Banis um which it is shaped differently from the hastata or the fish andalis but it's it's has a different kind of potency in the body um it was it was it's a native plant and so much of what I know about how to use it originally came from you know Native American uses but you know it can be used interchangeably it almost always shows up when I need it and if it shows up I'm like I either need this or somebody I know needs it right and it's not a showy plant and a lot of times people will walk right by it and not even see it don't notice it because it doesn't have mass it doesn't have these big showy flowers it only gets about two feet or two and a half feet tall um and that would be bit two and a half feet would be tall um but it always shows up um sumac if I see if it's a good sumac here I know I need to gather that one or I needed our our Mass amounts of the population or forgot I did you know but the sumac is the sumac the Stag hor which sumac are you referring to I do um generally I do the smooth sumac or the winged sumac so we have some stack horn but it's not the most abundant here okay so most often I'm going for the winged suac yeah because good to do that yeah yeah yeah so it's very you know so whatever is showing up is my favorite plan Ally of the moment it's there it's there is there I'm supposed to be using it or somebody is going to need it right yes I know you have a such a a longstanding and endearing relationship with jining you know through your ancestors and because it's you know you're in that habitat but it's one of the you know risk plan so you know how do you balance that because I know that you're I don't think it's at risk and I know we may different here yeah this but you know when we're exporting 45,000 pounds of it a year where is it endangered it's only endangered to American herbalist uh I think we should reclaim that plant for demestic use and stop exporting it and and so much of it and um let it be for the people on this continent right for us Solution that's a great solution yeah so why aren't we using it and because we would use so much less than 45,000 pounds yeah right that's a lot of plants it's like 11 million plants or something it's a tremendous number of plants that are coming either out of the wild or being wild simulated grown or being grown under a a canvas shade of some sort right why aren we using it because we've been kind of told it's in danger don't use it we stopped using it but it's all going over to Hong Kong yeah right and that is not unless we reclaim this plant for our use and start protecting it for ourselves it's going to keep going out of the country the same with black cohos so the same with FSE unicorn we need to reclaim our plants for us I think that's really good I'm so glad I asked that question that's something really to ponder and think about thank you yeah we would use a lot less the herbalist would be um kind to the plant and we would use a lot less um but the jinang export Market would suffer so so it's not if you think about it like that it's really not endangered it's part of this whole exploitation process we also see a lot more more emphasis on that wood simulated you know the it's wood grown but in its native habitat and also uh organic cultivation you know really trying to uh get farmers and Growers to grow it you know as crops because it's actually can be quite lucrative you know it takes a lot of time and work that's the thing but those those herbs go at really good prices so it could be which is why people are harvesting gens sang inappropriately um in the woods um because they need the money because it's going for a good price so they might be harvested and and still wait until August which is when most States kick in now you can start harvesting um August to January this they'll Harvest and oh here's a gy saying plant let's it's only made but I'm going to go ahead and get it um so if we controlled the use of it if we started buying it as herbalist and using it as our tradition we could go if it's not harvested in this time period I'm not taking it right um and then there's all these gensing plants that are thrown away too because they're not pretty enough to get sent overseas they're they're nipped they're scraped they're missing the little arm why aren't we using those because they're just thrown away yeah that's that's horrendous actually that's a that's criminal it is well we're coming we're coming to the end of our time and I had a couple other things I wanted to ask you and uh you know one of is um you know when you were first starting your herbal work as an herbalist what were the challenges that were facing you at that time that you felt were just challenging issues well it was it was in my kitchen and getting the kids to help me clean up the kitchen and then go in their back room and watch TV or play while I talk to a client so so a lot of it was just that home situation you have a big family you have five children and you're also this incredibly busy human being I mean I know I know this personally about you that your entire Community really depends on you for information education and Herbal Remedies you know so you had a very busy practice and five children yeah and five kids but you know people otherwise um you know the the nobody ever bothered me I never had you know anybody say anything bad about it or people just came in you know the other thing was you know back then and I kind of trained my clients now nobody called they just showed up knocking on your door I could be in the middle of cooking supper or getting ready to take my kids to soccer you know and somebody be going I need to talk to the heral lady um you know so those were kind of those extraneous things were more of a challenge the practice actually was the practice you know um never had any problem with any kind of legal issues I'm knocking on W um right I you know I just did practice and people just came so is it still that way Phyllis or have you have you kind of created more of a structure around your herbal work or do people still knock on the door people a little both um people are more attentive and we'll call and say hey can I come by and we set a time but then I'll get the odd person knocking on the door I still do so what do you think are some of the challenges that are facing the younger generation the herbalists who are coming into it now like getting enough experience having a good Mentor who has been in practice for a while um because I'm not seeing as much of that I'm seeing a young herbalist um not having that long mentorship like I did you know I had more than one but being able to sit with an experienced herbalist and watch them in practice and watch how they assess and um yeah I think that's sorely missing yeah I would say especially in even in the more recent years because there used to be a lot of uh apprenticeships where people are intern programs but mostly now people are learning online right so there's not a lot of even the herbal conferences and events are not happening so much now because there's so much online information that's right that's not always good information right right it's not always good information and it tends to be the same 15 herbs that you know that are considered safe but effective um and there's no practice there's no oversight and you know one of the things about our traditional herbal medicine is you were an apprentice it was a journey it was a you were a journey kind of situation it was um a trade yeah trade that's herbalism was a trade and like any other trade you worked under for a time another herbalist you followed them around you have them do their medicine making but importantly you learned how to do a session yeah you learned how to to pick an herb for that person in that situation and a various dud a part a smart person who is really into herbalism could figure this out on their own I'm not saying you couldn't figure it out on your own but having that is so much better yeah having somebody to work with is so much better yeah yeah that's to that's very insightful I I tend to really agree with you I think it's what there's so much there's so many educational opportunities and schools and programs going on now but the thing that is lacking is that one-on-one you know that internship or Apprentice program where people are you know in training for a while and getting that hands-on experience or clinics like going like you did down to Katrina you know and actually really just working Hands-On with other healers and herbalist yeah so do you have any um any like just parting words of wisdom to share with our listeners any plant wisdom that you want to just pass on well I really think that um as herbalist it's important to continue to spread the word about herbalism and the plants and um also it's also important for us to think about the origin of our plants our landscape our sources of herbalism are changing we are so much of what I consider my area um the woods are now being turned into cow pastures to raise beef um are they they're getting houses on them or I mean we're losing we're losing our land to modernization and the land is the home of the plants um so we still have to have this thought of I think conservatorship and that we are conservators of the land and there's no land there's no plants and so then then we think about where our plants are coming in from overseas and there's some really good work done on on you know where the origin of our plants and um most herb companies now are depending on kind of like a European Middle European countries or Asian countries that are growing the plants for them right because instead of like I'm also a a a person who believes that if it's our native plant let's try growing it here first I'm not saying we can't grow it someplace else but you know black Ka I should hey this is its home let's try growing it here in the appropriate environments and and having that conservatorship yeah and our that connection with the land so um I I see a lot of um younger herbalist who don't have a connection with the land but they have a lot of knowledge yeah great yeah and and I think kind of that combination is the best yeah you can certainly do one or the other without you know um but if you've got that combination of um really good educational background a good understanding the body understanding what the plants can do that only takes you so far yeah that's like a doctor only understanding a pharmaceutical drug yeah and what it can do you're you're missing part of the picture it's limiting the use of the herb to what somebody researched not the herb and All His glory that's so true that's beautiful good words of wisdom my dear yeah it's been so wonderful I could just listen to you forever not only um what you share also that wonderful southern accent it's so beautiful to listen to well thank you thank you Phyllis so much for joining us and
