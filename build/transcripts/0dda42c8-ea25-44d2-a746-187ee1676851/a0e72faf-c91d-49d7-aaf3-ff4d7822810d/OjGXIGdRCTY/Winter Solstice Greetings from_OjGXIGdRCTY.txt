Rosemary Gladstar: Winter Solstice greetings from the far north where the days are very short and the night's very long, but it's in that darkness where so much richness happens. We are nourished by the night. We rest and are restored. We have our dreams and our intuition comes alive. We're like the millions of seeds that are under the ground right now that are resting, gaining nourishment, they're gestating. Tomorrow they'll start to feel that light returning. They'll hear it, they'll feel it in their beings just like we do, and they'll begin to rise up like we do. Light beings rising. In fact, we are light beings. You know, we're like the stars walking here on earth shining back our light into the universe. It's not always an easy task, I know, to keep that light beaming, but we do it by staying connected to one another by dancing and singing and sharing together. And by doing these beautiful ceremonies together that humans have been doing throughout time. I wanted to share these really beautiful words as a blessing to you. They come from María Sabina. They're a translation. María Sabina was a very powerful shaman, a medicine woman, a curandera, and definitely a wise woman. She says, "Cure yourself with the light of the sun and the rays of the moon. With the sound of the river and the waterfall. With the swaying of the sea and the fluttering of birds. Heal yourself with Mint, with Neem and Eucalyptus. Sweeten yourself with Lavender, with Rosemary and Chamomile. Hug yourself with Cacao bean and Cinnamon. Put love in tea instead of sugar, and take it looking at the stars. Heal yourself with the kisses that the wind gives you and the hugs of the rain. Get strong with bare feet on the ground with everything that is born from it. Get smarter every day by listening to your intuition, and looking at the world through the eye at your forehead. Jump, dance, sing so that you live happier. Heal yourself with beautiful love. And always remember you are the medicine." You are the light. So I wish you a wonderful solstice. Sing, dance, celebrate together from my heart to yours with love.
