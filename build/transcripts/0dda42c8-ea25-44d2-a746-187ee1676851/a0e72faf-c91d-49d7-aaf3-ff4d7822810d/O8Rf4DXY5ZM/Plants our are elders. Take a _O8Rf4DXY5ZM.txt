when a person enters the garden a peacefulness exudes and I think that's why in the biblical stories and many many of the stories of creation that are shared around the world the story of the world's beginning almost always starts in a garden or with the plants and in truth we know that plants were some of the first inhabitants on this planet in every creation mythology no matter what story you believe in Plants we're always here before people so there are ancestors and our elders our wisdom teachers I think the greatest way that they offer their healing and their medicine is just through their beauty foreign
