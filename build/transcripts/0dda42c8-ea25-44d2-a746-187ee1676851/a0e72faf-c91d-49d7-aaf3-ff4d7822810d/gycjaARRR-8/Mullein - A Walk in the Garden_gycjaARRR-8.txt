Rosemary Gladstar: Yeah. So this is Mullein, one of my absolutely favorite plants. So I realize that I say that about almost every plant in the garden, but I think it's important to say that, right? It's like greeting a friend. You don't want to say, oh, you're a second class or a third class, you, you go to 'em and  just greet 'em with all that radiance, but look at this plant. And I really do love this plant. I love it because it's extremely hardy. It doesn't really care where it's growing. You'll find it growing along train tracks where there's nothing but gravel. You'll find it growing in rich soil. You'll find it growing on volcanoes in Hawaii that are exploding. It just is it's able to adapt to all situations and not only does it adapt, it looks stunning. Like this looks like a really expensive, you know, ornamental that I bought at some exotic nursery, right? And instead it's a weedy, seedy plant. And not only is it gorgeous, it's also an incredible medicinal plant and the entire plant is medicinal. So we'll start with the leaves. We want to identify that this is a biennial, a biennial means it takes two full seasons to grow. So the first year it sets a deep root and then beautiful leaves. And if I were harvesting the leaves, which are one of the best herbs that we have for bronchial congestion. They're very soothing. And so colds and coughs and allergies and asthma. This plant has astringent properties and some antimicrobial and some antibacterial properties. So it's fighting infection. It's soothing the bronchials. It's a perfect remedy for, I wouldn't say deep-seated bronchial issues like pneumonia or bronchitis, but for your colds and coughs and respiratory irritations, it's great. So that first year, you gather these big downy, soft leaves and that's when they're perfect. And then the second year it puts in this great stalk. And then up at this top, and I just love the fact that this plant is leaning over and looking into my house and watching us eat, and my mother play music and whatever else is going on in the house, it's actually peeking, you know, it's like a little peeking Mullein here, but on the top, you see those beautiful yellow flowers and those yellow flowers are one of the best remedies that I know of for ear infections. And they've been used for ear infections for really hundreds of years. They're often times combined with Garlic and sometimes with St. John's Wort. So herbalists always have different remedies of what they use, but really you can just take those beautiful yellow flowers and  make a Mullein flower oil. It's infused in Olive oil. It has incredible properties that fight infection, but also are an anodyne. So it helps to take the pain away as well. And really I've seen it work so many times. You have a little baby and you can't say, oh, I'm going to give you something that's going to stop your pain, but you put some warm Mullein flower oil. It'd be like warm, like mother's milk. It can't be hot. It has to be warm so you're not burning the eardrum and you put just a drop or two down both ears, and then you massage the ears. And really literally within minutes, the child stops crying. And that happens with adults as well. The one caution would be is you don't want to use it if you have swimmer's ear or definitely if you have a punctuated eardrum. You don't want to use it for that either, but for, for congested-type colds, where there's ear infections due to congestion, this is a really good remedy. At the early onset of an ear infection, it's really good. I do want to say, of course, if you have a long-term ear infection and there's a lot of pus and mucus, then you definitely need to go see a medical professional. So the leaves are used for the lungs, the flowers as an anodyne and for ear infections, but also just the stateliness of this plant. It has a lot of medicine just to lend by how it grows. When the stalks have dried up in the second year, there's millions of seeds in there, and I leave my Mullein stalks in the garden over the winter. It always seems to pierce above the snowline and it becomes a wonderful feeding ground for birds to come. So I just love looking out over my garden and seeing the birds in the wintertime clinging  to the Mullein. It also ensures that I'm going to have another crop of Mullein. You'll notice with Mullein that it usually takes two years before your seeds come up again. So I'm not going to have another Mullein growing here next year. It might be two or three years before I see little baby Mulleins coming. So for all of those reasons, hardiness, beauty, tenacity, adaptogenability and then just very incredible medicinal properties. Oh, I should mention too, for campers and hikers, Mullein is your natural toilet paper. It's a very smooth, soft toilet paper. However, I have heard of some students using it and they get rashes because it has little hairs on it. So, you know, depending how tender your bottom is, you might want to be  a little sensitive when you first use it, but I always look for a good Mullein when I'm out backpacking. It's the perfect nature's paper. There are recipes also for mixing it in with Tobacco and Indian Tobacco. And it was used oftentimes as part of a smoking blend to kind of, I think help soften some of the negative effects of the Tobacco, some of the strong negative effects. And it's also sometimes used when people are trying to stop smoke Tobacco. They'll mix a little bit of Mullein, sometimes Coltsfoot with it, which are both herbs that help with irritation in the lungs, they'll mix it with Tobacco and use that in their smoke to try to decrease the need for the Tobacco and also help to heal the lungs. People often ask me what I think about smoking herbs, and I have to say that smoke of any kind, even good smoke coming from Mullein or Coltsfoot is not good for the lungs. Even sitting around campfires, as much as we love that, the lungs don't like smoke. They like fresh clean air. So you can use it as a smoking mixture, but you need to be mindful that  you're using it as a step off of Tobacco. Or if you can't get off of Tobacco because it's so strongly addictive, at least using these herbs that are helping with the irritation. But I don't want people to think that smoking herbs is necessarily going to be really what your lungs love. I might say smoking any herb, actually some herbs maybe are better than others, but um, Tobacco definitely is very irritant for the lungs. So there you go. I love this plant.
