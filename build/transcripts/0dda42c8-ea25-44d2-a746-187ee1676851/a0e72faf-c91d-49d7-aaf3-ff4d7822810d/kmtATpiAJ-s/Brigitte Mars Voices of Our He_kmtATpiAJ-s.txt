hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant and healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do I [Music] feel I know that I'm of the when I see the I am thankful to be [Music] here I am thank I'm honored to have as my guest today my dear friend and fellow herbalist Brit Mars Brit is an herbalist extraordinaire and she's also a nutritional consultant with almost 50 years of experience she's a founding and professional member of the American herbalist Guild she's an amazing educator and is passionate about spreading her knowledge and love of plants with others RIT has taught as in numeral schools conferences and institutes throughout the United States including and this is just a few the yopa university aega Institute eselon and she's currently teaching at the school of health masterly in Ireland in Iceland excuse me um for for her full bio and to just just get a just so to get a glimpse of the influence she's had on herbal education in this country you'll need to go to her website and also at our website it will be posted J Bridget is the author of numerous books and DVDs including some of my favorites the addiction-free naturally the sexual herbal rossome natural first aid and she's and many many others she's recently finished a book about her outstanding life which we're all eagerly awaiting publication of and which I'm going to ask her about later bid is also a psychedelic sitter in endol life Doula and I should also mention that bid is one of the original members of the garet Queens a secret society of older wiser in still juicy herbalist FR thank you so much for joining me I am so excited to have this conversation with you I know that it will be interesting fun deep and juicy so thank you so much for being with me today it is certainly my pleasure and honor thank you Rosemary so I just wanted to start by asking do you remember when we first met I think it had to be over 35 maybe even 40 years ago do you remember that incident well it was certainly Brighton Bush but of course your name was Legend before that because I used to read well-being magazine I don't know if you remember that magazine well-being magazine they were one of the forerunners and there would be articles in there about or by Kathy kille and William L and your name was in there so when I met you at Brighton Bush I I do remember yes yeah well I have to say the reason I asked that is because I wanted to to also just honor you and say that you know I've met both of us have met like literally thousands and thousands of people in our lives at these herbal events and our travels around the world but that moment when I met you absolutely stands out in my mind because first of all you look almost exactly the same you still dress as cover as you did them you're still as positive and uplifting you just had this like fairy likee Spirit kind of danced up and you introduced yourself you know and your spirit was like a light being and I I've always remembered that and what's remarkable to me is you are the same person just wiser and older so yeah so the other thing I always like to ask is because I again because I love hearing it is just that aha moment if you know a a moment that you remember when the plants reached out out and called you or you first first really noticed the plant world around you or it's is there a story that you can share with us about that sure and I I think the first one is I might have been three or four and I had this wonderful French Canadian grandmother G and um she you know she didn't call herself an herbalist but she was definitely a wise woman she always kept a jar of flax seeds on the kitchen counter and one day we were walking in the wood woods and we found a little wounded bird and we brought it home she happened to have a little cage or box in the attic and she put Sav on it and she fed it some flax seeds and I remember saying I want to be able to do that and of course I wanted to keep the little bird but she said no it must fly back to its family and I said I want to learn how to be able to fix little wounded birds so I I think that was probably the first time um and you know there was another situation when I was a bit older and my sister who was 12 years younger had this skin condition called rosacea or or um something Rosa or something it was all and I said to my parents it started when you bought her that new chemical bubble bath and they said oh no what do you know we're going to the specialist we're putting her on steroids and you know what it was the bubble bath so I kind of I had this trust in nature really early on so that's really incredible did your grandmother influence you a lot or is it was it just um you know do you was she a big influence in your life you know she really was because you know being Canadian we would go out and we would make maple syrup and pour it on snow and call it ice cream and she made her own soap in a cauldron and you know of course there was something about herbs and fairy tales like in the Wild Swans the princess you know helped to break the Enchantment of her brothers turned into swans by weaving them each a cloak of nettles and you know it was like nles I mean h Christian Anderson wrote a story called The elder tree mother and I loved fairy tales and going back to my grandmother's which was a very um it was like going back a hundred years in time cuz she she had a wood stove and a root cellar and you know didn't have electricity didn't have TV so it was like this is like something out of a fairy tale I love it and of course I grew up in Upstate New York and I had a lot of Health I went to the ear nose and throat doctor and I was on antibiotics a lot and had lot of shots and I said no no just give me gr would say apple cider vinegar and honey or gr would say peppermint tea give me that give me that oh my goodness you had a really early interest yeah I think some of it was because of what was going on uh socially at that time too you know we were growing up at a time when there was there was an earth Revolution happening there's a revolution happening now maybe there's an evolution a revolution and evolution with every generation but there was certainly a you know that back to the Earth and getting back to Nature it was very strong influence in our lives but so it sounded like you were just part of that movement right yes rry someone last night was saying something you know like like the Baby Boomers maybe left the world in a mess it's like you know you got to keep in mind that 50 55 years ago the hippies were saying solar energy recycling organic gardening natural child birth yoga meditation sacred use of psychedelics um Community uh you know creativity uh we were doing all that we waiting for y'all to catch up so I'm glad that there's a new generation but for some of us we've been talking about this for so long and um you know we're starting to say like I like to joke and say the hippies were right all along you know I so agree with you appreciate I mean we really did a lot of work and we brought it to the next stage and I think it's always true that the current generation is always going to look back you know um and for and forget what their Elders did like we did that with our elders we forgot how hard they work to get where they were and that's just natural actually it's kind of a natural process yeah that's a that's a great way and I loved how you how you said that and stated that so was there a defining moment when you actually knew that you were going to be a nalist or were a nalist is was there some moment in time when that happened for you well you know I can be candid the first time I the first time I went into a natural food store I was on LSD and I was going to all girls boarding school Miss Hall school for young ladies and I went to the store you know one of the Town boys who was kind of my pal brought me in there and I said Tigers mil candy bars you know like I mean which really wer Tiger's Milk but it's was like sprout are alive wow um and then carab papaya so the people in the healthful store of took me under their wing and I was 15 years old and every week I would go back to the Pittsfield health food store in um Massachusetts and this nice couple every week I come in and say we think you're ready to learn about sprouting we think you're ready to learn about juicing and every week I would buy a book so I had a drawer in my boarding school in my dorm room and I had remedies that I was trying out on my friends like you could go to the nurse and she would give you an aspirin but you could go to bit's room and she might give you a cup of chamomile tea and um so I started having this little home business not that I charged for it but I realized that you know maybe my grandmother had a fifth grade education and even though I'm just a kid I had the herb book by John lus and therefore I would you know let's up in the book and what can I do and I really had this sense like these are things that have been used by millions of people for thousands of years and I'm not going to hurt anybody and usually the chamomile tea would help for the cramps or the headache or something and you know I I ended up being expelled from Miss houseall for some of the herbs that were in my drawer but you know he I had a good education and that's why I'm a run now because of mish Halls it sounded like you gave others there a good education to Brian I wonder if they remember you you know it would be fun to like they well they do as a matter of fact Rosemary I have to tell you you know it was my parents you know spent a lot of money to send me to that fine school that could have made me a debutant and you know about 20 years ago I realized I didn't have my high school diploma so I sent them copies of all the books I had written and the board of directors voted unanimously give that girl her diploma let's put a special section in the library she's written more books than any of our graduates and let's do a special story on her so I have really you know positive things to say now because you know it was a time and what I was you know doing smoking cannabis was illegal and I took a risk but I mean look you know here's another example of the hippies were right all along because here's a plant that make food fuel medicine fabric fiber you know all this things so yeah cannabis has always been a special plant for you hasn't it it's like definitely before it was legal I it was a plant that you were a very good advocate for and really stood by its side when it was being ganized well well I think a lot of herbalists that might have been one of the first plants because hey if this does something what does Hawthorne do what does garlic do and I have to tell you I was writing up a chairlift back when I used to ski and I was sitting next to a a doctor and I told him I was an herbalist he said I I don't believe herbs work and I said well you ever smoke cannabis and he said yeah I have some right here you want some and I said well that's an herb does that work and he kind of like oh I guess so oh I I just love it it's just great so um is there a teacher you know like one or two teachers that you know of who have had the most influence on your work um absolutely what a great question I am so delighted that when I moved to Boulder as a single mom with two little girls I went to massage school and during that time William lassier was teaching um up on the hill he like rented out this church and even though I was in school and I was exhausted and I had homework I went and sat at William lass's feet every night after school and we ended up becoming really good friends so he was definitely a big teacher in my life um you know I I did Michael Tiara's program I but you know I I worked at a hell food store for many years Alfalfa market and one of the things I did was I brought all the herbalist teachers that I wanted to bring to Boulder you know you and Susan weed and Rose and um Kathy kaville and Mindy green and Roy Upton and Christopher Hobs um herbal Ed so this was an opportunity I've got this big health food store that's going to take care of the marketing and the advertising and all I have to do is you know find a place and they can stay at my house and then I'll really get the download um but William was definitely a really big teacher in my life but I I want to mention that I lived for two and a half years in a teepe in the Ozarks this was before moving to Boulder and it was a commune and there was an old hillbilly woman and um she had outlift three husbands and the hippies would go over there and we would like do little chores for her and she'd give us you know a dozen eggs or you know five pounds of flour or something and I was going to help her weed the garden and I put my hand on something and she said what wait that that there's lamb's quarter it's it's wild spinach and you can eat that and I remember thinking oh my God we can eat this stuff that means we have three times more food in the garden than than I thought we're rich we're rich I want to credit you know that old hillbilly wisdom Mrs glor Mrs glore yeah it's amazing those how it is in The Villages and the hills and you know around the corners there's these old people whose names so often aren't well known but they have so much wisdom yeah you know I wanted to share with you briet that so many people that I've interviewed have mentioned William as one of their primary teachers you know and um yeah he came to Herb School very early on you know when we were and I would say he was profound the other thing I wanted to also mention in what you were just saying is I was fortunate to be one of those people that you invited to Boulder and part of coming to Boulder was staying with you in your magical house because when you talked about you know growing up with the fairy tales and so loving that you live the life of a fairy queen you know I mean your home is remarkable it's it's a stopping overplace in Boulder just a visit someday it will be a museum I'm sure but uh you've just surrounded yourself with beauty thank you truth beauty and goodness why be normal and boring um so I do really like that I and I'm actually gonna have a meeting with the boulder Historical Society to see if we might create the bit Mars psychedelic Museum and Memorial librar what am I going to do with all these books and then maybe my kids and grandkids you know someone can live in the basement and give tours twice a week and you know know maybe I don't know we'll see if it's feasible great idea it is a great idea you know you've you've been the kind of Living Model to me at least of the community herbalist in your community in Boulder I think you've lived there for what 50 years in the same house on the same street well because I've never learned to drive I I always have lived downtown so I've always lived within a few blocks but I've been in this house probably 40 years years yeah and and you know you see clients in that house and you do your work there you've made products you know um and so do you see yourself kind of as that Community herbalist model um I yes I see me do I mean I I do a weekly radio show on our community radio station I just came from doing that I mean every day Rosemary my prayer is you know I am here to help you let me know what I can do to help and I you know I'm really this is my prayer to the Creator and I've always felt it was the mission that if I can my way of helping the creators to help reconnect people to the plants that maybe they've you know didn't learn about or they thought were weeds and um you know I still have so much energy that I'm I'm so blessed I want to give back and of course I I do see clients in my house for health Consulting and I you know I'm a psychedelic sitter I have been you know since I was a at M Hall school but now I'm I'm a graduate of the the Psychedelic sitter school and the University where I teach at naropa University now has a department of psychedelic studies so you know we're we're kind of um on the Forefront here in Colorado with um it's decriminalized so we're on the right track um but of course to I I love this community and even though like I said I've never learned to drive I can walk with my rolly bag to eight different health food stores that sell organic food like what what is there to complain about you also travel all over the world too right you get some it's always amazing to me that you don't drive and yet you can get yourself to those airports and just travel everywhere it's really it's remarkable and magical well I do use the bus I know I do take the bus to the airport you don't fly I have a feeling that you fly well I do I just fly and you know the other night I was at a party and since I don't drive like I knew that my partner was in the state much later at the party I just look for somebody that I recognize like if you're driving towards downtown you can ask me any herbal questions you want um and then you know just drop me off near the mall yeah you know another thing I I've always admired you for is that you've ever since I've known you you've lived such a busy life you know you've taught you've written just numerous numerous books and you know you read a very busy herb company for many many years your your tea company which was really well-received nationally not just in in Boulder and yet you still manag to raise two beautiful healthy daughters and spend time with your family and so how are you able to do all of that re is like you know just uh you know to to balance that it's a difficult thing for people to balance often um you know I love the model of the fun bwa you know in bwam is a grid and funu means wind and water and I'm sure most of your listeners have heard of this but in funu there's nine sectors of the bwa there's career there's new knowledge and wisdom there's Community there's wealth there's reputation there's children in creativity there's um helpful people and travel and then there's health and it's really easy to just focus on career and relationship or uh children and health but but to really have a balanced life I think it's good to put energy into all the sectors of the bwa so if you organize your home according to this funu grid you kind of say like ah you know like well I got the cat litter box in the wealth Corner no wonder you know things are not working out um so I try you know so part of it is in organizing your life I will also say Rosemary I am a big believer in writing things down I like to say if you think it ink it I write everything down so if I say I'm going to do something I write it down how many times do we like oh someone invited you to this great party is it a potluck is it a birthday party or um they're going to be playing music I write it down and I love this this is the law of attraction planner so um I love this and I I even have a a place in the back where I write down movies that people tell me I might like or books that I might like I have a place where I write down all the things I lent people during the year and then around Halloween or sa I like you know you've had my Clan of the Cave Bear for a year now uh either read it or give it back um and and then I've also written down a list of all the things I want to accomplish in my life because you know as an end of life Doula you're supposed to think about what would you do if you only had three months to live okay and I mean a lot of us aren't blessed to know that we've got three months but like do those things now do those things now so that you're not like you know trying to finish that painting or that book in your like last few weeks I just learned a whole lot from you Bri thank you so much I'm G to get my little notepad out it's really a great idea and I and you are a person who actually has walked your talk you know totally like that's what I was what I was saying about watching you you know just create and do and be so effective and so fulfilled in what you do it's it's been lovely it's been a lovely uh Journey for me to watch you actually so I know that you are a professional psychedelic sitter and I'd love to hear more about that I'm sure our listeners would as well I think you've been one for probably a long time but now it's official can you just share a little bit about what you do with that work thank you so much so um you know I go way way back with with uh Rosemary lirry who was married to Tim lry so the other Rosemary my life was Rosemary lry and when she was on the run she was living in a house in Canada with me and my first husband and a few people but um we've had so many years of just say no and yet there's always been this underground Collective like yeah but you know San Pedro cactus and you know like this herb and that herb and psilocybin and so uh one of the things that I learned so much from rosemary was about the importance of creating safe set and setting and over the years I've seen a lot of people like they might take some of these medicines which can be very strong and unlock repress memories in what I think might not really be that safe situations like a concert or um a festival or you lose your friends and that might be one kind of ceremony and there's also the idea of like doing these things with a small group of friends in a very safe place like you know going in the forest or the beach but I learned that it it could be really helpful to have a guide and a guide is someone who's going to keep the space safe keep you hydrated hold your hand hand you tissues most important thing is to set an intention and I want to say that this kind of sacred plant medicine I only work with sacred PL I just work with plant medicines it's really important to have an intention not just like oh take this and see what happens if you have an intention like I want to be a better parent I I need to know my next step I have a big decision to make I want to be less afraid to die I um want to open my creativity so if you have an intention and you have someone who's helping to keep you safe hydrated walk to the bathroom hand you tissues when you cry record some of the like oh the people might say something you know get an idea for a company or someone they need to reach out to I'm not going to engage in discussion with them but I'll write it down I'll encourage them to bring their Journal so I I sit with them I'm not the medicine provider so I make it clear that I'm the sitter and I'm I'm going to help them to be safe so they can Journey really deep and this isn't micro doing this is these are generally you know large doses that are used in the safe set and setting and it's really profound work and I'm seeing a lot of people I you know I see all kinds of people I've had um young people who were about to go off to college and their therapist or their parents thought that they should have this experience I I was very moved that a a few months ago I had a 82y old man with stage four prostate cancer come because he came with this hospice care worker and his reason he was afraid to die and um you know he he he said I've got it I'm not afraid I know there's more than the material realm and and then the next week his hospice care worker came so it's really rewarding work and I and it's not for everybody and I usually screen people like you know if you're on SSRI drugs you know there's if you if you haven't done therapy it's not a substitute for eating healthy and using herbs and taking supplements and all the good things getting enough sleep but there are some people who are you know needing to break through and I am finding that a lot of people are so traumatized from so many things in life sexual abuse or divorce or you know loss of a Love or a child or a pet and you know people hold on to so much trauma and what they often get in the experience is it's not happening now I can let go of it and move on so I really hold space for that and I'm really honored and privileged to do it and I you know I continue my training um you know learning from other people who've been doing this but I feel that having Rosemary Larry and uh Terence McKenna who to stay here um were also really great teachers to have on my hard drive absolutely yeah yeah you got programmed very early yeah that is remarkable work so are you is it is this actually a profession now is this something I mention I heard you mention that you had gotten a certificate or done is there like actually a profession or um a certification course on being a psychedelic sitter or is it just well it's it's still really nebulous and it's still being thought out so a lot of psychotherapists are saying oh we want to be able to do this because the other drugs we've been using haven't been working that well all right so there's a lot of therapists who want to get in on it um but there are programs to license people and of course they're very expensive um and so you know my goal is to help teach people who want to be licensed but I did graduate from a program called um medicinal mindfulness psychedelic sitter School uh we learned to work with cannabis um because it was totally legal at the time it was before the decriminalization um but you know I I'm I'm very interested in this and again I'm right now I'm taking another course I I just read the Psychedelic explorers guide um because I think we need uh just say how because these things could be dangerous and uh they're not for everybody and we want to really we want to have a positive outcome they have a great potential to be very healing for people and again people who have tried everything um might find that this might hold some promise and answers for them that's awesome beautiful honey you know the other thing that you're doing that's again kind of Pathfinder like is the end of life doua you know and I was just made aware recently when I saw you actually in Boulder the last time that you were were doing this work and I'm really curious I think our listeners would be also is I'd like to know how you got into it and then really what that work is for you and if you have any stories the stories are always great to hear um surely so um I took a course through the cont ious dying Institute and then I ended up teaching in the conscious dying Institute and we also did a whole podcast series which you can find online it's called waking up before we die which is about the use of sacred plant medicine before death so um I it's a difficult conversation for people to have even within families and we want to be in denial about death but you know we do know in our natural living mod ity that if you want to have a natural child birth you're going to like read a book about it you're going to drink the raspberry leaf tea maybe you're going to do the prenatal yoga maybe you're gonna take a class on you know how to do Lamas breathing or hypn birthing or whatever get an aquaa pool you're going to do some preparation And yet when it comes to death like ah I don't want to talk about it or my loved ones will think that I want them to die but you know very often people die die unexpectedly and nobody knows what your wishes were did you want to be resuscitated did you want to donate your body to science did you want to be cremated did you want a Christian burial do you want a Buddhist cremation like what's the deal and some people like they don't you might have told somebody but if you don't have advanced directives written down where somebody can find them it you're really leaving a mess for your heirs to clean up and so I get together with families and we talk about the hard stuff like what is it that you would like what what kind of ceremony would you like what would you want to be dressed in to be viewed um you know and how you could play it so it's really a celebration of life and I do believe that life is eternal and that we do see our loved ones again so how can we take the sting and the stigma out of it and you know we get to embrace the the possibility that our loved ones have gone off on a cruise and we're all here weeping and I miss so much but then they get to go off on a cruise and someday we're going to be going there and I do believe we'll be reunited so I try to bring a little humor into it and a little you know spirituality but I talk about things like you know planning um what you want and making it easy for your like cleaning up all your stuff and who do you need to forgive who do you need to ask forgiveness for um how could you be more spiritually ready and so I'd say the best thing is I had um a a father come with his daughter and you know he he did pass but he you know he had an antique business so he valued all the things and he went to visit his three Ex-Wives and his daughter said I never knew seeing an end of life Doula could be so much fun so um but it's really getting the family to talk and talk about the hard stuff and then there's like even movies you can suggest that people watch like um departures or dying wish or astral City so I try to like get them ready to have the discussions and then be an advocate so that your wishes get done and your family isn't fighting about what he said she said and what their wishes are awesome so there's there's actually meeting with the family afterwards just to make sure that so um she does the uh death D also sit with the dying per person is that also part of what a that is a that is another part of it and so there's different times when you might come in it might come in when like someone's just gotten a diagnosis and they know they're going to die that's usually when I come in to help prepare but then there's also the sitting with them um going and playing music with them I recently went with someone and my friend played the diger do and I did the you know Tibetan singing bowls um you know praying with them breathing with them um you know giving the families a little bit of a break um you know empty in the dishwasher and then of course there's remedies for grief you know like homeopathic ignaa a mother wart pilot um and you know this this is a really hard thing but you know I went through a divorce after 38 years of marriage a few years ago and rosemary you were so kind you sent me the most beautiful card which I have framed but around the same time my my one of my best friends her husband died and my massage therapist said make a list of a hundred reasons why this is okay and I thought like what's okay about this there's nothing okay about this and my friend who'd lost her husband we started making a list together you know they're not suffering and my list was stuff like I don't have to vacuum every day and um I don't have I don't have to like make gourmet meals and I can wear pink eyeshadow if I want to and but you know we started making a list like they're not suffering I can focus on my own work there and we we just worked on that and I found that to be really helpful and I do I did like that movie astral City a lot which kind of shows that it's based on someone's experience in the near-death experience realm and it it it seems really positive and of course the urania book which I've long been a reader of you know does say we see our loved ones again we continue it's an evolutionary career you're not going to come back as a and and you know what you don't even have come back you don't necessarily even have to come back to the same Planet there's a whole universe to explore and the universe is designed to be inhabited and it sounds glorious so I mean being born is less glor than dying agree with you yeah that's such a beautiful look Outlook appreciate and you know again you live your life this way it's really beautiful you know yeah so um yeah I know you probably have many instances of stories but I just I love hearing the stories of when people saw you know saw plants like work miracles you know healing Miracles either on themselves or someone else I call it witnessing for the plants you know used to do that at the in at the herb conferences where we just have a space where people could get up and witness for the plants I'd love that if you have a story or two to share of just when you've seen plants work miracles yeah so so many um you know garlic garlic has always been an ally and I've you know used it for so many things I had covid twice I put raw garlic in my baked sweet potatoes like that was great my daughter rainbow had asthma when she was little but I will share this my daughter rainbow when she was little had asthma and she I twice we took her to the hospital cuz I didn't know what it was and they gave back then they gave shots of adrenaline I was like oh this seems really intense and at the time I was going to massage school so I started doing all my papers for anatomy for physiology for nutrition for herbal medicine I just started like I every paper I did was on asthma the for Five Element Theory it was on you know the the metal element lungs large intestines so I just started learning every aspect of it and um I learned about this formula which is really similar to the fire cider but it was before I heard the ter term fire cider and it was actually this Rost starian who told me um put in a blender uh honey lemon juice garlic ginger and cayenne pepper so sort of a you know a bridge version of a fire Sider and I blended it all up and if rainbow start started to have asthma I would give her a spoonful of that and then I also taught her how to do yoga breathing you know like and I put a little duck on her belly and I say like make the make the waves get big now make the waves get small so I put a little duck on her belly and I told to do yoga breathing and now she's got like 30 yoga DVDs and has taught yoga and you know all around the world and gone on tour with you know Red Hot Chili Peppers and you two to teach them yoga and um so you know I would say it's really simple and I love Rosemary how you really value the kitchen medicines because people think like oh it's so it's so daunting and vast but I love dandelion you know dandelion we eat dandelion all the time and I think that when we learn to eat the wild weeds that these are Jedi plants that adapt to adversity so we can look at the world and say oh my God there's Chemtrails and electromagnetic pollution and uh 5gs coming to your town and oh what's in the water and uh chemical spill ah but the dandelion survive adversity they grow planted them no one mulched them no and weeded them or watered them and they thrived and so I really think the answer is eat the weeds and when we eat something so fresh that it was just growing you can't get that at Whole Foods I mean even though I'm glad they're there but how long ago was your organic kale in the ground you know that's awesome yeah you have that wonderful new book coming out on Dandy line which I love I got to preview it it's just stunning you know the information is incredible and entertaining and deep and then those wonderful illustrations I'm so excited that it's just highlighting dandelion it's really it's coming out this spring right or yes and thank you so much to I think you're you've written a comment for the back cover or something but I actually I actually wrote the book maybe 30 years ago and I thought this is going to save the world they're going to put this on the shelves where the Roundup used to be and you know what the book did well in China it was translated into Spanish as well as Chinese and it went out of print in English but story publishing who I know we both love and work with a lot they are redoing it and so hopefully the time is now Rosemary again we've been saying this for so long but free food and Medicine in your yard this is a Jedi plant this is the plant that has superpowers that's doesn't it yeah well I could tell you that book is going to be selling in Tractor Supply and in the grocery stores you know it is it is its time it's Dandy lon's time so I know you have a lot of different special plant allies but I'd love to hear you talk about you know the ones that you are always there for you when you need them those special plants that have kind of become your your yeah more than just plant medicine for you but really like allies that are there to support you I'm sure Dandy L's one of them but I know you have other I always like to say if I were going to another planet and I could bring three plants with me they would be dandelion Nettles and cannabis you know I just had this I just had the discussion um Yaro uh Yaro who's the son of Terry Willard Yaro Willard he's a y herbalist I just saw him at natural products Expo and feather Jones and Roy Upton and I were all standing there and he said I always like to ask the older herbalist if you could only have one plant with you what would you bring and Roy said coconut and I said well I would bring hemp seeds and he said no I would bring coconut I said well coconut only grows in the tropics and it takes a long time to get that big tree but cannabis grows as tall as a tree in one season and you could eat the leaves juice the leaves make you know sandals and fiber and fabric and bl but I do want to give kudos to Nettles so a German woman gave me one nettle plant years ago I transplanted it to my new home and now I have a 100,000 nettle plants growing by the side of our house in our yeah by the side of our house in Boulder and I live in condo I don't own the land but you know I do a lot of gorilla gardening So within a season I can cut the Nettles three times and dry them and have Nettles for the winter but tonight I'm going to make Nettles span aopa okay and um I'm for my class on Wednesday we're gonna make nettle potato soup and you know what I am even a big fan of nettles tication the getting stung with Nettles and this is going to sound crazy but Rosemary you've always said that you know the garlic Queens we need to be the ones to show we're not doing Botox we're going to rejoice in our Beauty and I sting my face with Nettles it's like a little herbal face lift I just like take a nettle and I go whack whack whack whack whack and then I'm a little red for a few minutes but it brings all this fresh blood flow to the area and you know my daughter rainbow who's had a career as a supermodel she comes home from Hollywood she says mom I need you to spank my butt my thighs with Nettles I'm doing a swim shoot shot okay and then you know hair loss sting your scalpa Nettles and you know before the days of Viagra uhhuh sting Sting the lingum to bring fresh blood flow to the area I know you're all probably thinking no wonder she's divorced but I just want to tell you that it is totally safe not that he had problems with that but it really does bring fresh to the area and arthritic joints you know like I have little stiffness in my fingers and I deliberately get stung with the nettle so that's a whole another aspect um I even have a nettle dress I didn't make it but you know if I want to play Viking woman I I have this nettle dress because it's also a fabric plant and of course Rudolph Steiner said Nettles are the heart of the world but the resiliency of this plant um and every spring I I cut them I make cuting and I put them in water so they root and I always say last week March first week in April I have a hundred nettle plants on my porch to give away so that when I leave the planet there will be thousands of metal patches because it thrives well here oh that's just wonderful yeah you know that tication is was actually an old treatment you know there's not very many people who do it anymore but I do know I do know a couple of men Dr Jim Duke very well-known respect Ed he supposedly ticated um and uh I I know a couple other men also they they didn't I don't think they did it a second time but they did it once and you know I had a a bone spur in my foot I put nettle in my shoe and walked on it and I had a tooth infection and I put nettle up in there too um and and took a lot of antimicrobial herbs and was able to avoid doing the antibiotics so and I've done it over my eyelids over my closed eyelids and here I am you know I used to wear glasses and I don't still but so but I used to wear I wore glasses until 10th grade so I don't know I do this crazy stuff eat blueberries do the eye exercises and I have strung over my eyelids with Nettles you you might not like me if you try it but I just wanted to say I believe it's safe I really do it's great I'm GNA try the facial I don't know about the um about the tication below the belt but definitely I'm going to try the facial so thank you for being such an inspiration also thank you for just speaking your truth I love that about you so you are a great writer and you've written I've lost count but you must have written I think over 10 maybe even more books um some of like to 14 yeah and you have a couple more coming out I do I have um I have dandelion medicine coming out this spring and rosemary I saw a appreciate because you wrote a forward for a book that I did several years ago that also went out of print it was called the home reference to holistic health and healing like how fraking generic is that so it went out of print but inner Traditions is re-releasing it to be called natural remedies for mental and emotional health and we're still using yeah so I'm really excited about that because you know in in Asian medicine herbs and acupuncture and diet are used for depression and anxiety and fear and grief and stroke recovery and all of that but here it's like we have a whole different modality if you have physical conditions you go to this kind of doctor and mental conditions you do this and I feel like this is a real integration because you know very often people with depression and we know that it is a you know huge problem in our culture they could have a food allergy that's causing brain inflammation they could have a nutritional deficiency they could have stagnant liver Chi as we say in you know Asian medicine they could have a low thyroid and so I'm trying to bridge the gap because there are things that we can do for mental problems like anxiety and fear and grief and um so I'm really excited about that and as you know I have long been working on a memoir book it's I'm still in the like final editing stages but it's called um and of course you're in it Rosemary I have um a a few chapters but there's one called plant freaks um there's a lot of the chapters have fun titles but the book is called it will be called Wildflower child a tale of sex psychedelics and natural foods but there's chapters with names like Tangled Up In tie dye or um prep school girls gone wild or through the rabbit hole come together yeah so um it's a real journey because you know a lot of these stories of the 60s are written by men or written by rock stars but they often end up in like and then I had to go to rehab because I you know did too much coke and all that but because I was a young mother I had sunflower when I was 18 I had rainbow you know four years after that and I was using herbs on them for you know everything there was always this sense like I need to be responsible I need my kids to be well-nourished we're not going to like hippie kids have rickets or something it was like so I I tried a lot of this herbal stuff out on them and you know for a while I lived in the Ozarks and the teepee without electricity and all of that um so I'm writing about all of that but I feel like this is a story of um you know not taking the descent into addiction but like combining my love of Nature and plants and health and healing and um all of that and so I'm you know that has taught me a lot and of course I there's like a lot of Shameless name drop in in the book like you know oh when Alex Gray comes over or or you know whatever Tim Le or Yoko Ono on the phone but that kind of makes it sort of cultural because people can relate oh I remember I remember Fizzies yeah oh it's GNA be wonderful I'm so I know I know a little bit about your life and uh your life story and it's fascinating and it goes it has so many different twists and turns you know and you and you have no so many amazing people so yeah it'll be really fun when that book comes out of the books that you've published um that are already published out do you have a favorite like one that you just really U just adore for whatever reason they're like they're all like our little children as you know Rosemary and you've probably written like way more books than I have but you know I love natural first aid um because Natural feier State because you know we need to be prepared for an emergency and you know this is just like a little pocketbook and not only does it tell you what to do for like be stings and broken bones and all that it has what to do for a bad trip but it also has like finding water when there is no water and what to do in an avalanche and what to do if there's radiation or what to do um with some even like what to do if someone's in a coma so there's a lot of things that you're not going to find in a regular first aid book and so I'm really happy about this a a little bit on you know few wild foods that you can recognize and I really think that that book has saved my life twice already just by writing the book and we had a fire in our house and I knew that if I poured water on the lamp that had burst into flames that the whole house would short out but I remembered from writing the book like no no you got to unplug it before you do that and then I also remember thinking like oh it's really smoky in here I should open a window but I remembered no no that's going to give more oxygen to the fire um and you know I also put the story in that um you know I got bit by a copperhead many years ago and um and this is when I did have electricity but my my wasbin Tom he um used shop vac and he sucked the venom out and I thought that was really good he sucked the venom out really quick and the is sometimes you just have to make something up and use what you have that's part of being ready for an emergency yeah that that is an excellent book by the way uh and I'm sure it's popular right now because so many people are thinking about being ready for emergencies and stuff I also love your book that you did on the sexual herball I think that's great and then addiction free naturally you take subjects and then you go into them really deep they're not just you know you're not just hitting on the same things everybody say and you integrate a lot of like you were talking about with the mental health of integrating you know diet and food and herbs and all the different things you actually do that with every subject you know so I think those two books are incredibly important and really valuable and fun thank you so much and even even things like you know color therapy like if someone's really depressed maybe like wearing some color or you know redecorating your place or you know if someone's really anxious like maybe Red's not the color to wear today maybe you want like calming blue so color therapy aroma therapy uh Flower Essences we've got so many allies and you know of course when we write a book we learn so much we embody and grock which is now in the dictionary um you know we we really like we really get it yeah that's amazing yeah so um yeah it's kind of odd to ask you this question because I don't think that you but I'm going to ask it to you anyway so I love odd I love odd the wizard of odds well I just you know the way I was gonna ask it is like were there any particular challenges facing you when you first started working with plants and became an herbalist but you you take every Challenge and you sort of make it into you know an opportunity so that's what I was saying it's like but I will ask you that were there any particular challenges or difficulties when when you first began your practice of verbalism so for a while you know when sunflower and rainbow were little I worked half a day in a health food store and I was making minimum wage and they wanted me to like you know wear lipstick and tie my hair and like and I was like oh this really uh so I had I said I'm gonna go to travel agency school okay and I was all set to go to travel agency school and then John Haye who was one of the FI Financial backer and founders of Celestial Seasonings he said this this hell food store Pearl Street Market is looking for an herbis because they have this bulk herb section but nobody buys anything because nobody knows what to do with it and you know I really consider John Hay to be a mentor of mine because he helped me write a resume until I got it right on his typewriter and so I ended up having this herb department and I started demoing tees and then I realized well we're still not selling a lot so I'm going to start offering classes outside of the store so I started teaching in aopa and at my house and you know giving herb walks and so you know I I really think that it was that turn like wow I can oh I was so happy I was I had an herb Department given to me so a lot of young herbalists who are listening here you know if you're wondering what the next step is like you know see if you can work in the Nutrition department of uh health food store or in an herb store and like just like ordering the herbs and putting them away and their fragrance and maybe serving a different tea to the public and getting to know each one and you know so to me that was just so rich but you know in the beginning I didn't talk a lot about things like the doctrine of signatures the the idea that plants maybe tell us what they're good for by the way they look and by the way they grow because that just sent a little woo woo but now it's like no no you know you're menstruating you should make some borch or uh eat blueberries for your eyes and yeah cauliflower is really good for the brain and seaweed for the hair so I'm um I don't mind being a little woooo right now because you know the more we look at botney and Flower Essences and Homeopathy it does seem that the the signature the signatura the sign of nature the imprint of the Divine is it abounds in nature so true I love how you did take what was challenging and turned it into a great opportunity I knew you could do that because you do that with your life you know again so um when you look at you know the herbal Community today and the young herbalists come up coming up what do you see are the challenges facing them it's entirely different than when we were young herbalists right I I mean I remember in Brighton Bush there were like 20 of us you know around the country you know Stephen Foster David Winston Michael Moore Michael Tru Kathy kille Mindy green it's like and now there's like probably 200 herb schools in the country and I once in a while teach at the Colorado School of clinical herbalism and I see that they're getting um you know really good education they're learning a lot about you know constituents and I'm sure every school is different um but i' see that this is a career path that a lot of young people want to have and if you you know look at Tik Tok of which I am a big fan of there's a lot of people coming out and and really trying to make this like a regular everyday thing it's not like only for the herbalist this is medicine for the people and you know it really should be every you know Homemaker mother father uh scout leader Wilderness like we should all know this and it's going to help us to be better stewards of the earth and I love da David Hoffman who's another dear friend and herbal Elder like you know he always used to say like you know the healing of our planet coincides with the healing of humanity and when our planet is sick humanity is sick and so you can't really be an herbalist without really being a steward of the planet so I'm glad we need more people on our team yeah it was great when we were just the only 20 and we were you know really famous but we're we still are and we're going to be the elders and we're so glad that you're all catching on and that you can buy Natural Foods just about everywhere and um that chamomile is our old name thank you you know Celestial Seasonings which is also a boulder company for you know like you you helped we all helped and so now it's becoming an ordinary thing and young people are growing up with this and it's a course in universities sometimes like neuropa that's awesome isn't it yeah that's such again such a positive putting it all into such a positive perspective it's just beautiful and you do it naturally you're not trying to do that it just come I think it's because you lived your life this way so at this point in your life it just comes like it just flows right through you so briet you know we're kind of coming to the end of our time and you have accomplished and done so much in your life and are still accomplishing and doing so much but are is there anything in particular that you're particularly proud of that you've done in your life that you know like you would just stand and go I'm so glad I did that you know is there anything stands out for you you know I I just think that the whole life and and doing it all without driving you know to be 70 and have never learned to drive a car like you know uh but I'm I'm grateful that I got to teach and influence people and I could say you know I'm I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to raise my daughters I'm grateful that I wrote the books I'm grateful for the life that I've had I'm I really feel like I'm I've learned a lot and I'm going to keep going as long as I can and we could focus on the problems of the world but we could all do something even if it's growing tomatoes on our balcony or letting your neighbors know like Don't Spray the dandelions let me Harvest them and I'll bring you a salad we can all do something and I guess the last things I want to say when I have the mic I always like to say the best time to PL to tree is 20 years ago the next best time is now and if you have water to throw away throw it on a plant that's so beautiful honey thank you so much for being on this planet I'm so glad I'm here with you you know this is really just inspiring to listen to you and so grateful for you thank you so much you know I I always like to end by if you have any wide wise words to offer and you just did that you just did it naturally so thank you sister so much thank you so much and thank you for what you do Rosemary bless you and I hope our pass cross again soon I am thankful to be here I am thankful to be [Music] here
