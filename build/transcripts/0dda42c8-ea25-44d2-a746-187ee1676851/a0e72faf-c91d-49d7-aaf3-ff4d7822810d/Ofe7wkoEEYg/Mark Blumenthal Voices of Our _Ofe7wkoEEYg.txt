influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant and healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do and I can feel the

sister never too busy to take time for you and honored and deeply grateful for you're including me with this series of uh podcasts and interviews you're doing with so many really wonderful people that all all of us admire and appreciate for contributions uh past present and hopefully long time into the future as well yeah that's so true yeah we have a long history you know I I remember I first met you I think it was in the 1970s and you were the owner of a really wonderful small herbal company called sweetheart herbs do you remember that I'm sure you do do I remember sweetheart herbs I remember meeting you uh yeah I remember sweetheart I I it was the company I owned for 12 years wholesaling herbs out of Austin Texas my hometown now and I remember meeting you too because uh I was one of the very first Distributors of a herbal tea line coming out of gerville California called traditional medicinal herbal teas and I believe as my memory will serve me uh that you are the formulator of those first six I believe there were six herbal um herbal tea combinations in these coffee bags with labels on them that you and Drake Sadler put together and which is still today an iconic Legacy herbal tea company nearing it's coming close to 47 or 50 years in the business so you know and I was one of your first Distributors as a matter of fact I was talking to one of the companies employees who was there back in the day and they said they used to have a chalkboard in the office with like the the the name of like the five distributors or whatever six that they would add new ones when they got them and oh this month we need to call Markus sweetheart and see if he's going to make another order and things were so I mean that's how it was it was chalk on a Blackboard that that he and Drake would uh okay they say we can generate some some orders here we'll call our Distributors and see if they want some more stuff but it was it was let's see mother's milk mother's milk Gypsy cold care Throat Coat Smooth Move which is still today I believe the bestselling herbal laxative in the natur in the Natural Food Channel so Gypsy cold car did I say that uh so I got five out of six I think of the original flavors or they're more than flavors they were functional that was the cool thing about traditionals those were teas that were Blended to taste good and actually work and you know it was so cool because it was so different from anything no disrespect but back in the day there was Celestial Seasonings which dominated The herbal tea Market helped create the herbal tea Market of the day there was a tea company around called Magic Mountain herbal tea which also came from Northern California it was Andy BR Andy Briner of Amy was originally I think one of the co-founders of that and we sold that we had the San Francisco herbal teas from Barry Meltzer at San Francisco herbs and we we sold his teas and and uh celect which we did and alvido which were the old line te companies from the 30s we didn't sell them but they were in every health food store and that was about it back then I may be missing one and that was that was about it but the and the traditional te's that you formulated were so different than anything else and the packaging which they weren't teabags they were bulk they were like there was bulk tea they didn't even have tea bags yet they just had bulk tea like a 2 o glassine line coffee type bag with a with a label stuck on and they were very cool labels you know one color label it was like a or maybe a twool the screen it was a screen label all like in a brownish color but that was and that was one of your first Distributors well you were also one of the first companies that I ordered herbs from too so that it was uh you know that you were one of the companies that I would get the herbs for for my little herb shop but I'm just wondering you know back in those days when really there wasn't a very large herb industry it wasn't like we were going into it expecting to really even earn a livelihood what possessed you to open up that herb company like what was the inspiration for you well good question I had become I started sweetheart herbs with a friend who dropped out after a year um good man he was like he was my partner and he he was selling jining Roots out of the trunk of his car he was selling Korean red Jin sing that he got in Chown in San Francisco and selling out this trunk to anybody who a gensing route and he was impressed by I bought the biggest most expensive route because I was already into Jens sing at the time this was 1974 73 or 74 so actually you said 45 years just to clarify the record here we are in April of 2023 just to timestamp this conversation for posterity in case you know the tape doesn't struct or whatever but you know uh so I'm actually on the cusp of the 50th year of being in the actively engaged in the herb movement from a business perspective even though I'm no longer and haven't for you know for 30 some OD years I haven't sold any herbal products but we started sweetheart in and summer of 74 and from Jin say we started with jins saying and herbal tea basically but I got involved because in 1968 when I was graduating from the University of Texas as a senior and I thought that I was going to go to graduate school and study political Theory and political philosophy and study that was my major I became a vegetarian as a war protest against and this is right when they were building up for the 10 offensive and they that they had just abolished the draft exemption in March 68 so and what they realized was that the graduate schools were filling up with all these men who were studying basket weaving or whatever they could get to do a master sociology philosophy psychology history engineering whatever they could get into they were filling up on the grad schools were full and because it was basically an exemption from the draft and the draft boards figured this out and they unilaterally gave us like two months notice or three months notice forget about going to grad school or law school unless you're going to go to medical or dental school fine then we get you on the way out then you have to serve you know so I started thinking what's important to me and I was a philosophy minor and political science what's what's what are my values what do I believe in what's true what's true for me now this is after 1968 it was after sergeant pepper summer in 1967 and you know that's what we called it Sergeant Pepper sub that's was when that came The Beatles album came out and uh you know we already were experimenting with herbs already was 1968 and so I'd already had a relationship with that that plant since ' 66 but I started real what's important to me and I realized that you know in in the Jewish tradition we say when we toast someone and unlike in Spanish where you say Salud which is means to your health means to life and it's about honoring the sanctity of life and I realized I need to commit myself to the sanctity of life and I realized that I didn't want to be involved with killing people because my government says that for this decade these are the people that deserve to be killed for political or economic reasons or whatever and I realized I didn't want to pay someone to do the dirty work so to speak of killing animals for my food and my sustenance and I realized that there should should be another way for me to survive in a healthy way without the Flesh of animals which I could not look in the eye and tell that animal I need your meat for my sustenance I need your bones for my tools I need your skin or hide from my tent or my family's clothing there's got to be a way through the plant world for me to live on this planet without killing animals or paying somebody else to do what I find to be emotionally and then later moral and morally objectionable and I'm not preaching here I don't I'm not one of those vegetarians that goes out and tries to convert people if asked I'm willing to share and it was later I learned more of the moral and the economic and the environmental um value propositions for the vegetarian agenda so I started going to hell food stores to try to find and these were health food stores they were pill shops they were not natural food stores in 1968 they were they weren't like with the big bins of the granola that didn't come until like the early 70s or whatever it was really just pill shops with foods for special dietary use for people who were diabetic or had needed low sodium it was the only place back then you could get yogurt and it's the only place back you get whole wheed bread and the only place you could get vitamin C you couldn't get them in a grocery store you couldn't get them in a drugstore it didn't happen heal food stores were already there with a very limited did bandwidth of what they offered but to me that was enough and I started going in there and to just to find ways to supplement protein from animals from non-animal sources and they had this whole wall of of teas in these stores that were select and alvita brands from the 30s or 40s and they were individual herbs I never heard of and then they had books like Back to Eden by Jethro Claus and the herb book by John lus which was my very first herb book The Herb book by John lus and then the herbalist by Joseph Meyer who was the founder of Indiana Botanic Gardens in like 1910 and I just spoke with his great-grandson my friend Tim Cleveland who still owns Indiana botanics you know 113 years later wow they were a mail order business and still are but I'm not I'm not plugging it but there's a historical precedent here because they're what I would call a legacy herban company because they've got over 100 Years of continual successful operation so I just started reading all this stuff and the stuff I was reading was all traditional folk medicine there was traditional medicine folk medicine the idea of scientific research on herbs and medicinal plants was just getting started but in Europe the very first chemically standardized herbal extract was produced by a company called pharmaton in 1968 it was a gensing extract still on the market known as jinana standardized to 4% ginsenosides which is the average amount that you find in gensin Roots Asian Jensen Roots anyway total of three 4% gen ctid so they just standardize it it's not like a big pharmaceutical conspiracy it was just a product that was reliably giving the same amount of these known active compounds that are found in jining so that was starting over there in' 68 but we didn't know about it over here it was all the folk medicine it was the you know the Jarvis uh was it was it Mr Jarvis with the uh Vermont the switcher you know the Dr app cider vinegar you know with the and which has really made a comeback that's amazing because apple cider vinegar is now one of the top selling herbal supplements in the market which is that which is in effect like an herbal supplement because you know it's apple cider but where does herbs stop becoming food and where does food stop becoming an herb and there's this Continuum of plants and fungi that are used for food for fragrance and spice and yeah for you know simple medicines as tea as teas for flavor and then as medicinal so we have this wonderful gamut or spectrum of opportunity and possibility with different types of herbs in different types of formats and ways of taking them and many common you many of them were common foods like garlic and ginger and turmeric and I'm going these are food the you know these aren't these aren't medicines these are foods but then you know there's the food should be your medicine your medicine should be your food going back to hypocrates and all that and I just got fascinated by this it became a hobby for me it became a just studying and I lived on a commune up in New Mexico near tows for two years off the grid and from 70 to 72 really tell me a little bit about that no I didn't hear that I don't remember that part of your your story I'd love to know a little more about that it's in my bio at ABC no I in your bio it's not in your bio my bio okay well may maybe I should maybe I should go back maybe we need to be revision this history and put that in there but it should definitely be in your bio so I have a dear friend named Roger who was my roommate in college for two years and he lived in Houston had some friends from there that moved up to New Mexico bought 88 acres of land Southeast 35 miles Southeast of Talis up in the mountains uh no we had a little ditch for irrigation for five of those Acres but that was for irrigation that was not potable water uh and there was so there was no water no electricity it was basically raw land and Roger says come up and check this out we're you know were starting up there and everybody was living in their vehicles I mean because with this got got there and parked the vehicle or pitched a big old army AR Army Surplus tent or whatever they had no they had no buildings and I came up there I live I had a 67 Chevy van that was outfitted in the back with like a little couch kind of thing that folded over and and on a futon that made I I lived in my van a lot yeah drove drove around the country picking up hitchhikers hanging out and in my you know in my van it was 1969 and Rogers come and check us out so I came out liveed with them for a couple of month weeks in the summer went out to Northern California they invited me to stay with them and were inviting you to stay and build because people would come and come pass through but not everybody got invited to stay so I got to be one of the first people that got to be part of this Core group of people that basically I lived there for two years so the first the first I should put this in my Memoir someday the first building the first building that we built guess what it was an her room or what I don't know it was an ous an ouse that was my second guess either an her room or an ouse right because we had we felt like you know sanitation first you have to make an the second was it was a communal kitchen okay a place a place to eat and then people then started working on building their own separate homes you know and houses and stuff like that so that's but that with electricity and without running water and and it really it was like going to summer camp for two years but you know like in the woods without anything and it really impressed and we were reading the whole earth catalog and Mother Earth News and you know Bradford Bradford and Ander stalking the wild or Bradford and or was it e Gibbons stocking I'm Bradford Andre's wild medical and then also h and Scott nering uh fromont I mean they were like Heroes I mean and and just how to grow a victory vegetable garden you know and live off of that you on like a a quarter of an acre or whatever those kind of books were Radical even though there was not there was nothing radical about them they were so simple and common sense it was about what it takes to live in the world on a piece of land even though none of us were really you know survivalist per se you know many of the people people want the commun that I was that I mean they lived for the first couple years they had food stamps I did not I did not do the food stamp thing I I couldn't I couldn't see frankly dropping out so to speak yeah and then living off food stamps which as a philosophy student I found to be a logical inconsistency that would make me uh super hypocrite and I'm not calling my dear friends the ones that are still with us Hypocrites it's just that I chose not to do it that way unfortunately I had a had had a business in Austin uh with a friend that I was involved with helping manage my friend's ice cream business and so we had we had 22 popsicle trucks going around town and these little Jeep type Scouts selling Bomb Pops and missile whistles and fudgicle and dreamsicles and stuff to the love and neighborhoods was this before sweetheart herbs the popsicle the popsicle wagon the pops the popsicle thing started in ' 67 when I was in college with my friend and I we I we worked we and we had some popsicle trucks we rent rented and then we end up buying some trucks that we got into foreclosure but they were little like Jeeps but they were Scouts and they had one seat and no no no doors and then the back had a had a chest freezer when we put the ice cream in with the dry ice and then a like fiberglass bat of inversed on some poles that for a roof and a bell that you would ring when you go up and down the street and we had all these hippies coming in from San Francisco going through Austin they would would give us a guitar or a camera or something as a as a deposit for $50 worth of ice cream and they go out and that was a lot of money back then $50 wor of ice cream at wholesale and you sell at retail so they Al They also they got they got free they got a free vehicle to drive they had a truck to drive or a a vehicle and there would be like four or five people on these on on these Jeep with just you know one seat and everybody hanging on and they would show and you know plug it in at what I always say is plug it in at night use an extension cord plug it in so the ice cream doesn't melt and uh come back tomorrow and then they would we'd wholesale them the ice cream so and you know the Popsicles so I have to pay Carill this years of selling kids popsicles and fudge cicles I'll tell here's a funny story there was I think it was like yeah it was around 69 or 70 and you know Nixon agon were were in and and you know the country was very very polarized like it is now had War anti-war situation and you know there was there was a culture Clash back then that was significant yes and some of the drivers told me and these drivers had were long hair some were bearded and they would say you know this whole neighborhood is not they're not buying ice cream they're not buying from us and I remember this I went I said I'll go check it out so I had shorter hair back then I was just still in college or just out of it or whatever and uh don't remember but anyway I went knocking on doors High my name is Mark I'm from the ice cream man company and I just you know just taking a survey and if anybody would talk to me and I have to go to the third or fourth house before somebody would talk to me and this woman says I said people aren't buying any Popsicles they were buying why aren't you all buying popsicles from us and she says this is a classic this is a she says because we know that you're putting LSD in the dream s it's true it's true story I'm not making this up oh wow LSD and the dream sickles that's oh my God got now so I'm so being a political science major and a philosophy minor I had a response or so I thought anyway my response was ma'am I can appreciate your concern but let me assure you that we're running a for-profit business here we trying to and I happen to know I don't know why so I Sunshine acid LSD Sunshine acid the orange little pressed little barrels they called them they were press little pills you would know nothing about this of course uh that was they sold for $2 a piece these are $2 in 1969 or whatever $2 a piece but if you bought a bag of a hundred of them they were 50 cents I said even if I were to buy these at 50 cents a piece I could not put them into a dreamsicle that I pay blue belt creamies like 11 cents for and sell them by the box of 24 for 15 cents so that my drivers can sell and retail for a quarter I would lose money I would lose money there's no way I could run a business putting a 50 Cent item into a 15 cent item do you understand it does doesn't doesn't work financially the economics don't work I'm trying to be rational I'm trying to be intelligent I'm trying to give factual information who would have thought who would have thought so you know why it didn't work here's the here's the punchline she says yes I what you say might be true she says in so many words but we know that you can still do it because the Communists underwrite it oh no are you kidding me you've got to be kidding me I'm telling you the truth here this is like I've told this story a dozens of times over the years and at that point I realized there's nothing I can say there's nothing there's nothing I can do to explain to her that a I'm not a communist B I don't hang out with Communists I don't know any Communists and they're not giving us under writing the the dreamsicles I mean thank you it's like thank you for your time have a nice day and I think that was before the have a nice day became a slogan but may may you have a robustly healthy life whatever this must have been one of the few times in your life where you actually had nothing more to say Mark right it's like she she rendered you speechless that's just a crazy incredible story oh my goodness I've never heard that one before that's a great yeah so you know camel mile on the on the uh see the camomile I can't see it really it looks like a camomile oh there it is yeah I can definitely see it it is a c it's a it's it's an Astera of some sort I didn't key out the actual species and genus of that coffee cup I think it's okay so sweet is there a person or persons that have most influenced your your herbal work or your life that you would want to mention like you know somebody in your herbal world that really had a huge impact on you as a young person there are there are people not just one yeah but let me but before I answer that one can I give you my first herbal lesson please I just Dy you hear this okay what is it my first lesson in herbal medicine aside from the fact that my old German grandmother would give us Camille and bluten tea sometimes for upset stomach which was Chom that's one ma Marta of blessed memory my grandmother ma Marta Michaelson she would camil and bluten okay but the real first herbal lesson so we're in high school biology class it's 1962 and we have our favorite teacher Mr Joe Lion Okay l y o n l y n and Mr Lion of El Paso of blessed memory as with Marta everybody liked him we liked him so much we made him our senior class advisor after because we had he was just wonderful one of those one of those teachers you really light yeah he was from the old country he was from Lebanon W and he had a very strong accent he was a short portly man and um I can hear his voice and he would it was the day that we're dissecting tapeworm so kids all across Texas have tapeworm dissection week or whatever you know because they these things according to the curriculum and it's all scheduled and you know it's all standardized and they this the high school gets this bucket of for Malahide that's full of these tape dead tapeworms and everybody gets a tapeworm on their dish and there's two people at a desk and you got your little you know scissors and scalpel and I don't know how they do it now probably the same but this was 60 1962 what is that 51 years ago or 61 years ago wow yeah who would have thought that we say years ago only Texas well probably in Iowa and Arkansas and everywhere else too but I don't know so he would say you know back in the old country and he would go on and tell us a story about how it was back in Lebanon and that a lot of people didn't have the money to buy Western pharmaceutical type of medicines so they relied on their traditional medicine which is interesting because he said you we took pumpkin seeds raw pumpkin seeds which are native to North America so how they became a traditional medicine in Lebanon over the last 4 years is interesting also because it's a borrowed Planet it's not a native Planet it's native to North America right you know this and he said we would take raw pumpkin seeds and fast we would fast for a day and eat at night eat the raw pumpkin seeds and the raw pumpkin seeds have a compound in them somehow makes the tapeworm drunk that's the term you use it inebriated the tapeworm and the hooks of the tapeworms head they has these hooks on it would let go of the side of the bowel and it would come out in the morning stool in the morning M Bell movement and that's my first herbal lesson I'm and I still remember it because I'm going wow and we know today that one of the uses of pumpkin seed is as a vermifuge we know this like but here's here's the lesson the lesson from Mr Jo Lian who is also our senior physiology teacher it was he was wonderful so you know you know how it is in life that you have teachers in the public or private school who have an impact on you he was one of them who has a lifetime impact on me because I've always remembered when I got into herbs in the 1968 six years later 6970 yeah as a hobby I remembered Mr Lion and the tapeworm story with the pumpkin seed oh that's amazing I was wondering how you were going to bring that back there it is it's a perfect circle that is a truly for so many reasons that's a truly amazing story Mark yeah I also love that you have such a great memory that you can I mean that is a pretty memorable story for certain so because you remember that do you remember a moment when you I think you already shared this I think I already got it in one of your answers but do you remember a moment when you sort of absolutely knew that you were on the herbalist path or you know on the herbal journey is there a is there a moment in your life that you can recall yeah I admittedly had a relationship with cannabis since 1966 yeah um there's no secret about that shouldn't be grateful to have no and I'm grateful to have had that long relationship with that plan so that was one of the first times when I realized my go there's this interesting thing going on with plants uh that I'm not aware of based on my normal waking State of Consciousness based on my previous life until that point was April of 66 that was like what uh 60 years ago whatever it was but one of the first things for me was watching a cat with cat lip and if anybody ever doubts that herbs have pharmacologically active value and and here's something that you don't put in your mouth and you don't put it on your skin but a cat inhales it and within seconds they're rolling on the ground or doing whatever because it goes into the nasal and then goes into the bloodstream and it goes across the bloodb brain barrier within seconds those nepo lactones or whatever is going on that's part of the volatile aspect of catnb and catnip oil wow so for me one of the first herbal lessons that I went wo was actually not knowing not just knowing that catnip historically the cats like catnip but they actually the first time I saw a cat actually react to catnip and that was like and we have we have two cats here at the house or two cats have us is really the more like how it works because that's how we are and we still have it where you know I just spray a little catnip spray of the of the so it's one of the best communicators of the value that plants have value value and plants work the other one was aloe vera the first time I tried aloe vera on a on a a burn and that was from the leaf of the plant with the fresh gel on the burn within three or four or five seconds and the immediate relief that it gave or the amelioration whoa and I think that CIP and aloe vera two of the best ways to start any herbal lesson for anyone because it's like so so culturally acceptable and and familiar it's not foreign it's not like some weird it's not exotic it's like really it's like right here right here I I think every every every household in the world should have an aloe vera plant or two or three every and take the bottom take the old leaves on the bottom and there's so many things you can do with Alo gel pretty amazing hey Mark did you know that cats actually like Valyrian more than camomile did you know that oh excuse me I'm sorry catnip yeah yeah have you tried have you tried valarian with your cats I have not but you know it's funny because I you there's that whole story about the pi Piper of Hamlin right you know that story in the literature I think it's in it may even be in M Reeve I don't remember she wrote writing in the 1930 35 or whatever about how the pine Piper of Hamlin was able to rid the rid the the town of rats wasn't it it was rats yeah it was grass because of the Val the valaran they like the smell of the valan and but I've not tried a valan on cats but it's a good idea and I've got some valaran extract that never I never use but the nice thing about valaran extract in most cases it lasts forever I'm almost yeah I don't know if the extract works as well as the powder but the one problem with using it is it everything in your house smells really badly where catnip it doesn't smell so badly but you should try it sometime with your kitties yeah right yeah yeah well I don't know I don't know that Valyrian and the smell of dirty socks is characterized as badly that you're making a judgment you're making a judgment you know that's your that's your experience I mean a lot of people like to smell of dirty socks apparently I don't know I I'm not I'm not one of them but I I know I I think I was just mostly saying that because if any of our listers went out and got Valar and put it around for their cats they would keep wondering why their house had a strange odor but listen I wanted to ask you like it seems like really very early on in your herbal career you were drawn to the work of legal and Regulatory issues you know the ethics of labeling and marketing like it it seemed to really focus your work can you share a little bit about why and how you got involved you know I was a political science major so it makes sense that I would express myself in the area of government government Affairs although in the last 30 35 years I've had very little interaction we don't we're not a Lobby organization I mean with all Michael McGuffin at the American herbal products Association and Lauren israelson at the United Natural Products Alliance and other people in the trade Association part of the industry are very actively engaged in those domains as they should be and they are doing a great job and of representing the interests Etc and that's not what ABC is about the American Botanical Council I didn't but we we're about just we're about disseminating accurate responsible reliable inform authoritative information on herbs and medicinal plants because back even back then there was so much misinformation and disinformation and bibliographic Echo that Steven Foster you the late wonderful brother of ours are Steven Foster by the way these are Steven's photos on my shirt I don't know if you recognize this or not by the way all right time out for time out for a out for an honoring of a of a dear friend and brother so he these are these are pictures of the covers of herbal gram and let me with the microphone here but the logo of ABC here's herbal gram covers Eon these are all this saffron the Cula here the Cannabis here my other shirt which is in the line I have two of these shirts one of them has Jim Duke right here over my heart uh so that so what happened is on the 30th anniversary of the ABC the employees called me down to the kitchen this is before the this was five years ago we 35 now and they had an impromptu 30th anniversary party and they gave me this gift and I opened it up and it's a bolt of cloth oh you're kidding it's a bolt of cloth they gave me that they had the art director designed it from the covers of the Steven Foster photos from herbal gram and the logo of ABC and they found a company in Italy that would make this shirt they knew it I I wouldn't wear it unless it was blue and because it had to be a blue shirt all my shirts are blue and they're all Hawaiian style whatever but they gave me the cloth and it's bamboo rayon so it's sustainable bamboo rayon it's a natural so I took it to uh I took it to a Taylor one of my Hawaiian shirts and said here's the pattern used my shirt here's a pattern but make sure that when you put the pocket that it lines up with the rest of the shirt don't have the pocket be out of sink because I W you know I went to the fabric store and I bought some blue buttons I didn't want white buttons that would interfere with the Galt of the of the shirt and I was and Miracle of Miracles there was enough cloth to make two shirts and there was enough oil there was enough oil to burn for eight nights there was enough cloth to make two shirts so these are the only two shirts like this in the world although people would like people have told me I want one please you know I'll pay for it whatever donations so I may end up going into the clothing business I mean I mean selling shirts and calf for women may want calf or something you know why just shirt you know so these are Stephen Foster's photos that I wear on my on my sleeve really you know Steven is one of The Inspirations for me for doing this podcast really honestly you know like I so many of our dear friends and you know these brilliant people in the that were so close to us and had such an influence on American herbalism as it is today we're passing you know and I just thought it would we really need to collect these stories and I thought a way of honoring people like Stephen who have passed on is at the very end of the series I'm going to have little groups of people who knew people like Steven Foster and you know Michael Phillips and you know who knew these different herbalists and we'll just have Roundtable discussions and share their stories because they really need to be part of it so hey Mark could you mind would you mind sharing with me um how you started herbalgram like I remember getting the very first little I still have them those early editions I think they came out in the 1980s right and then how you put together summer summer I think July or summer of 1983 so in a few months and this is 30th anniversary of that's remarkable yeah before that I was publishing a newsletter in a magazine called herb news under the ages of the herb trade Association which went defunct in 1979 or 80 or 81 uh several years after I was president that was the first herb Organization for Industry Group so then we started Opa and as part of starting the American herbal products Association which also just celebrated last year its 40th anniversary as part of being on the board with the OPA I said okay we need to have a communication device we need a way to communicate among hopefully our members if we can get people to join but also the scientists and AC additions and people in our community and health professionals and just growing group of herbalists we need to find a way to communicate among all of us and this was for some of you that are watching this uh believe it or not this is before the thing called the internet and before email and before fax machines so we didn't have fa machine so we had to actually go to the the store and have them print you know a 100 or 200 copies on eight pages and then 12 pages and then 16 pages on I wouldn't use white paper I had to use cream color paper black never on never black and white it was never black and white it was on cream color paper for for 17 issues 17ish we published it quarterly as a originally a communication arm of the American herbal products Association Opa and the as you mentioned herb Research Foundation which Rob maleb uh and I started and Rob ran for many years and uh so and then after five years of herbalgram for Opa and hrf I started ABC in order to create a platform to take herbalgram from being this little newsletter and try to take it to the level of Scientific American that was my vision I wanted it to be like Scientific American and colorful and you know or National Geographic you know that kind of perception and that kind quality because I realized that people didn't take herbs seriously and one of the ways to get them to take more seriously and not just regarded as just folk medicine and old wives tales and all these dismissive terms although there's nothing wrong with the term vul medicine but it was used derisively discounting dismissively because it that it didn't have any scientific proof so how can you trust this it's there science so we took herbal gram and we create I created a nonprofit platform for this because I wanted didn't want to be dependent on Advertising because I didn't want my advertisers to dictate what I could or couldn't write print so I fig a nonprofit platform we take members but unlike other organizations our members don't have a vote so I'm 35 years later I still have a job smart so you know they're talking about succession planning and getting rid of the you know which I'm happy to do we're looking for someone to come in and you know start learning how to run the organization by the way which we are opening open to soon and we're going to be looking for someone as an associate executive director but uh to to to learn you know over time but I yeah we we don't use the r well we don't use the RW at ABC there's no retirement I mean then once you're in you're in you can't leave you know it's like the hotel California you can check out anytime you want but you can ever leave uh I people say when when are you retiring and the answer is no of course not why this is my this is not a job it's a lifestyle and that's what a lot of people don't understand and I know there's so much we can talk about especially I do want to talk about some of the people that did influence me to whom I'm eternally and profoundly grateful but I want to get clear about the what the work that some of us do as writers as Educators as herbalists uh as as activists as advocates um in so many ways as formulators as consultants as insults whatever uh you know a lot of what we do is driven by our innate commitment to this lifestyle and to the understanding that natural has its place and in many ways natural is better and for us anyway we've chosen that we've chosen the natural way we didn't want artificial food we didn't want artificial stuff in our food we we didn't want artificial medicines we wanted natural from the earth that had energy that was substantial and real but you in a different way way than many people realized and so there's no there's no retirement from that there's it's who you are it's what we are what who I am what I'm for I'm still vegetarian 55 years later thank you thank you for being a vet when I meet vegetarians like a waiter waitress in a restaurant oh I'm vegetarian too you know oh really how long been a vegetarian why are you so I interview them why are you a vegetarian congrat and I thank them every one of them every time I meet a vegetarian I thank you for being a vegetarian but I don't go out and prati for it you know my wife my my wife eats chicken and fish I'm fine with that that's her yeah but anyway so I don't know where we were oh so uh 40 years all that's it's a it's a lifestyle commitment it's who we are just like for you I mean there's no giving this up it may be changing the way we do things there may be you know uh slowing down the pace maybe a little bit or having less less on our plate and less plates because the thing I know about you and I know about me and so many of us it's not about how much you have on your plate it's how many plates here you got stuff on it's a feast in front of us a giant Feast you you know I did want to ask you about that sweetie you know you you've done it's so much you know you're like the founding member and also executive director and the president of really you know so many incredible organizations that have flourished you know and you've written so many articles like hundreds of Articles and you know on and on and on and I just you know how does one even do all of these things like um but I think you kind of answered that in saying that you know it's not work it's a lifestyle you know and you've also maintain a long-term marriage within a remarkable powerful woman herself like Jacqueline is an author and she has her own Institute and she has a profound influence usually you don't see two powerhouses together who are busy all the time so how is it that you maintain any sense of balance or is it just not about balance just to clarify she did let go of that work and all the workshops and all that stuff and the she's written her 10th book and she's she tells she says she's retired but then right now she's she's a little bit south of 88 right now so it's okay she's that's that's her choice she's you know she's the the older woman who cougared me back in the day and lucky me uh so lucky her now that I'm I get to take out the compost you see I there's still somebody to do the basic stuff right so I I do I do all the shoplifting uh shopping and uh you know and bring in bring in the the 40 pound things of uh cat litter and all that so somebody got to do that so I I have a very so the thing is it's about gratitude it's like I wake up in the morning great grateful to wake up in the morning and I wake up in the morning grateful to wake up into a healthy body and I'm grateful to wake up next to this goddess who loves me who I have this wonderful relationship with and I'm grateful for my family my daughters my grandchildren my friends every morning I go through that and I'm grateful to have meaning and purpose in my life or at least I live in the illusion that what I do has meaning and purpose when I think about the fact that there's an estimated 400 billion stars in the galaxy just this one I think is what the I read somewhere and I I'm having a hard time who can get their mind around that and then there's with the you know the Hubble and now the James web there's you know a billion galaxies estimated you know how do I think that anything that I can be doing has any real meaning or significance I feel that sometimes and I think about it because I love astronomy I mean I read read like to read books on astronomy it's one of my favorite hobbies is to read about these things but I'm not you know not I'm not a astrophysicist like not any of that no training at all just you know like so many people am you look in the Stars people have been doing that since the beginning of of you know civilization and before looking at the stars and wondering so I start my day with with gratitude and one of my gratitudes by the way is for Gravity I'm grateful for gravity and that's my C CCH all for all the other hundred things that I could name that I'm grateful for and people to who I'm grateful on a daily basis but I just sum it all together and kind I catch 22 and put it all in one bucket and I call it and I say gravity and it covers everything and I'm grateful for Gravity for at least two reasons and one of them is without gravity we wouldn't have a biosphere we have no oxygen we wouldn't be living because it would all be just blown off because it as Earth hurdled through space and on the other level without gravity the toilet is don't work so you have to be you have you have to be you know it's the sacred and the profane it's the it's the common and The Uncommon it's the high and the low it's the all of that all in one the Oneness of The Duality and the multiplicity of it all and I just be grateful for it so I start the day with gratitude and a sense of commitment and purpose and I immediately screw up something but it's like it's okay you know you you you you don't you you give it up for you know for the mission and I I often told the people I work with and we have to remember that we're here to serve the mission of the organization it's a nonprofit organization and I just you know and I and I remind people sometimes that we don't own the mission the mission owns us the mission found us is we're expressing it and the fact is I tell that to people because there's so many other herb organizations that we have so much respect for and gratitude for who are part of the mission there's we don't have competitors at ABC we're nonprofit 501c3 tax exempt nonprofit research and education organization we're here to help move forward the conversation and the awareness and the inspiration about natural medicine and how the plant and the planet provide us so much that we have used and need to be able to use more intelligently and there's new opportunities there's all kinds of development of new medicines or whatever from the plant kingdom and the fungal Kingdom and I don't like to use the word Kingdom very much I I would prefer the word either Kingdom which is the Lin margulis term because it's about inter relations or to get out of the sexist botanist creation of this thing with lus we can call it the queendom and have more fun with it but the fact is that whatever the fact is that the Earth provides us so much you know that we can learn to use in ways that we haven't figured out yet and at the same time ReDiscover the the old uses too and honor all of it and honor all of it and find out ways that we can uh use that for self-medication but also in in clinical medicine as well when it's appropriate and that's why we got involved with the research because we are realizing that there's a growing body of research going on in Europe and we started systematically reporting on or unsystematically Rob MB especially used to write Rob's research reviews and he would summarize some of the emerging research coming out of mostly Western Europe at the time when we were like leaders in that field because we were showing people that hey there's science here there's research here and this all makes sense it makes sense and there's a and that's why we continue doing what we do and we love working with other organizations as well because different organizations have carved out different pieces of the of the whole puzzle and the big pie that we have that all we share which is the world the wonderful world of herbs and there's so much I mean we can talk about sustain ability and the whole issue of our sustainable urge program and and the and the issue of quality control with our Botanical adulter prevention program by the way we're in our 13th year with the Botanical adulter prevention program we have published 80 peer-reviewed Publications this is another thing that I think is really important that our listeners know about that you really found it again it's a program that you really initiated and brought forth it would you please share about it because it's so important and also so you know it's just had a wonderful recognition so yeah yeah I I've I've long been interested in accuracy and honesty and labeling of verbal products if you're going to buy a product in the store or wherever nowadays it's on the Internet or wherever it is it should be properly labeled and the ingredients should be authentic they should be actually what the label claims them to be and they need they to be as pure and as clean as possible and these are commitments that many many responsible ethical herb companies live by on a daily basis there's many good quality products there's good people there's people who really care about the authenticity and the quality of the ingredients of their of the products they make and they care about the end users personal health experience in taking their tea or their extract or their capsule or their their Sav or whatever A lot of people good people with good companies with reliable products are out there making a very a Rob bust herb Market with natural products and stuff at the same time at the same time historically speaking people have cheated we know this the first article that we put together as part of the Botanical adulterant prevention program which is something that I had a lot of issues with from and concerns about and I could if we had more time we could talk about all that and the gensing research we did we tested 500 gensing products in the 1990s and yada and we how we got the so-called wild red American ginsing off the market it was a fraud it was kinigra rumix high menal sepis that had nothing to do botanically uh structurally chemically ethnobotanically historically geographically with real American ginsing at all nothing to do with it but they called it wild red American gin Brad and through education got the health food stores to stop selling that but we did we didn't didn't have the internet so there's no alternative way for them to Market it if they didn't sell nelfis we got that off the market so the point being history the first article that we published under the Botanical adultman prevention program by Design Steven Foster wrote an article that I asked him to write studying the history it's of adulteration it's called a brief history of adulteration of herbs spices and Botanical drugs and it goes back to Greco Roman times 2,000 years ago with all these examples in the literature of fraudulent material and or stuff that's got sand in it or whatever to increase the weight ways people cheated and the point of that is that if people are upset because there's a reports of cheating in the market the fact is it's been happening and we could probably go back another 4,000 years but the documentation is harder to make so we just went 2,000 years is that enough for you 2,000 years is that enough so when is excuse me when is enough enough here so the point was that it's not something that you just find in the modern herbal industry and we don't know the extent of it because it's hard to get numbers on that but the fact is that we've documented there is adulteration and fraud going on the market surprise surprise and what we do is we provide for free access anybody in the world can take this information for free all they have to do is register anybody in the world can take this information 80 different papers so far and newsletters documenting the adulteration and fraud in the marketplace but we're doing is providing it for the responsible companies who are willing to utilize this information in the way they do their necessary quality control especially the first job in quality control which is always confirm the identity Purity is important and contamination Etc that's number two that's that's that's priority to the first priority is is it what it claims to be is it jining is it genko is it garlic is it Ginger whatever is it what it claims to be and then we'll talk about the purity of it or whatever and the problem it has been is that sometimes people have switched things with a lower cost ingredient uh to the economic gain of the seller the economic detriment of the buyer and that switch is not transparent it's not labeled okay it's not it's concealed that's what Fraud's about if it was labeled and it was not be fraudulent I told you it was cut with all this other stuff it didn't say Jin sing with boom boom and there's three other ingredients that are cheaper that are in there but no sometimes the other ingredients are in there or whatever's been switched and they've diluted it but they haven't declared it so what we're do what we do is we help companies be able to set their specifications for the quality of their ingredients in such a way as to be able to ensure the authenticity of the ingredient and detect the attempts to adulterate and I'll just say one more thing we just published a Jour an article in the journal natural products which is one of the world's leading medical plant journals they reportedly reject like 80% of the manuscripts that come to them so we're grateful to get published by them and we've uh we have an article that summarizes a lot of the work we've done in the last 12 or 13 years at the Botanical adults prevention program and the article the takeaway messages from the article is a adulteration is not accidental there is accidental adulteration but that that's a one-off usually here and there appear is human error people mistake things things happen but the intentional economically motivated adulteration where economics motivates somebody to cheat to the expense of the buyer or the user that is with us and the fact of the matter is that EMA fortunately usually results in economic violations but not safety problems there's a few like the skull cap it was the first one we published after the history article in herbal gram because skull cap had been adulterated and switched entirely with two cre germander and the germander numerous species of germ manners have been tested and they've shown to be hepatotoxic so there was some course in the literature back in the 7s and 80s about skull cap products or hops bolian skull cap combination being associated with some liver toxicity when it turns out that it wasn't the Hops it wasn't the Valyrian and it really wasn't the skullcat because the skullcat wasn't skull cap it was germander yeah so that's the so whenever there's a safety issue which is not very often that would take a priority other than just explaining to people in the industry and elsewhere uh or whoever wants to listen uh how to best navigate the market we don't know if some of these adulterations are five or 10% on some of these herbs are more we have an article we're working on on how do you measure the extent of adulteration it's very difficult to do but at least we know that it's happening so we tell people that some certain herb categories are subject to adulter ation which means adulteration of that herb has been detected and it may be a very small part of the market hopefully it is but we don't know but we still want people to know how to make sure that their material is authentic to help increase the chances that consumers are going to buy authentic products that work thank you so much Mark that's such important work it's so amazing you know like really everything that you've done has had such a profound influence and there you are behind the scenes you know laughing and doing your comic books and just and we'll get to that in a minute but I did want to mention you you you've received just numerous Awards over the years including the lifetime leadership award by the nutrition Business Journal in 2005 and the esteemed Vero Tyler price from the American Society of pharmacology in 2010 and then in 2017 you were named outstanding International ethn pharmacist of the Year by the Indian Society of ethnopharmacology and on and on and on and on is there any award that you were particularly pleased I know you I know you you're pleased to get them all and grateful and humble but is there any that really just stood out for you yeah thank you for that it was actually the outstanding ethn pharmacologist not pharmacist just to be clear I'm not but the phac pharmacology is ethnobot it's a big long word I know I know these this is the ver verbal edit there sorry but you know just make sure that it's as no far and um I was honored all for all the it's always I'm grateful to receive recognition for my work I mean most recently I was outstanding ex- student at my high school and I had to go back to homecoming and I was on the foot with two other outstanding exes I'm on the football field at halftime and then the parade in this car going around the high school with this parade going on and the assembly and it was wonderful because I love my high school I was student council pres I was student council president and all that kind of stuff but you know I was I I loved High School it was a good time for me a lot of people have a l hard time with high school but I had a lot of friend I'm still I go back to my reunions every every 10 years now we do them every five years we do our reunions more more frequently because uh you know it's uh there's less of us there but um I'm really grateful for that experience and uh but the I'll tell you an award I really appreciate which is not I don't they they don't give it any more back in the 1980s or 90s some people in the industry at uh Expo East in Baltimore at natural products Expo East gave me what was called the cliff Adler heart and business award and you know um Cliff Adler was a friend a colleague um in the Natural Food business that Eden Foods he was not in the herb business per se he was in the Natural Food business but the eeden foods also sold herbal products and imported ginsing from China and stuff and they're still business today but C I think I think Cliff died not car wreck or something and u a way to acknowledge his um contribution to the industry they start they set up as award and they gave it to people who I thought they thought had gone through business adversity and life with a sense of heart and you know was were able to come out of adversity or whatever and uh you know we've all gone through adversity and I you know grateful for it it's always one of your greatest teachers and opportunities you just don't know it at the time sometimes and uh it's you know you know deal but they know if you always remember my father this too shall pass right that that that W that that wisdom of that it all it's all transion anyway pretty much except for the values which are Eternal and one of them is heart and love and you know so I really appreciate getting that award from some of my friends uh in the urban herb was and the actually was the natural food industry wasn't even the urban industry per se and I got an award a couple years ago I got from Opa which I'm grateful for I kid about I kid about it sometimes they gave me their Supernatural award and they never they they've never done that before and they've never done it since because they made it up for me I think I think when people ask me how I'm doing I often say I don't want to be cute or anything but I I do kind of want to I say Supernatural instead of I'm fine I'm good they how are you doing I'm Supernatural man and how are you and uh like it shows up for them maybe because of my Visage you know and that I'm Supernatural and the people who know me of course know that I'm vegetarian and I'm I try to live a natural lifestyle as much as possible and so they got the supernatural award from up which which was the one off and thank you for that but but but Mark Plotkin they asked Mark Plotkin to present the award because he was their keynote speaker for their annual meeting and Mark and I had just been out the dinner the night before and we're friends onor advis you board he's an ethnobot for people don't know Mark pla is an ethnobotanist he's a a well- read author uh brilliant guy um and is doing great work in the Amazon with his Amazon conservation team where he came up with the idea a couple years ago real quick sidebar here he came up with the idea to help protect the culture of the people of the area that he was in working on in Surinam he he realized that in order to protect the people they had to have borders that were documented to be able to protect otherwise they're just living in the rainforest and there's no borders so he set up I think one of the very first if not the very first attempts ever to actually survey the lands of certain indigenous people so they could set up actually defensible or at least documentable borders to help defend and defend their culture against the onslaught of the dominant culture and the cultural survival issues that is so that that's Mark Plotkin that's an aspect of Mark Plotkin that I want to acknowledge so Mark is introducing me and for this award for on behalf of opa and I think he said you know at the end he said if Paras elsis and who was it it was somebody else it was oh the diares and paracelis and grouo marks had a son it would be more oh my God that is so Supernatural perfect that is just awesome it's true I mean every body cracked up in the I cracked up I still crack up when I think of it because just the idea that these three men with these three historical figures would have a son right and they all they' all be like equally part of the DNA of this being I mean just the concept of it irres of who they are just the idea that that supposed a certain degree of uh you know expansion of your mindset right there you know I can totally understand understand why you were awarded the that heart award because it's one of the things that I've always loved and admired about you and I I've seen you in large groups of people and small groups of people and at airports and in so many different places in the last 40-some years and you know I you're I've always admired this about you if there's anybody who's kind of standing alone or outside the circle it doesn't matter who they are you know whether they're well-known or not wellknown you will always always go you're the one who goes over and notices those people and always has conversations with them and always draws them into the circle and it yeah it just always touched me so much you know because you know you're very well known in the world and have traveled in so many different circles and yet that humbleness in you and that ability to reach out to everybody and pull them into the circle is very very beautiful yeah you know I also want to say that not only have you received new Awards you've also created and given out a huge number of Awards in fact every time I get a newsletter from ABC there's always more and more awards that are being created and one was created in your honor with the Mark Blumenthal Community award which I was very honored to be a recipient of in fact of all the rewards I've gotten that's my number one favorite but can you share how this war came into being a little bit do you mind sharing that I would be honored and grateful to share that this is great because I created that award for you I created this is true I've told you this I've told you this before you know how's your how's your memory here I wanted I wanted we've we have first context for everybody we have the Jim Duke great botanist friend one of the founders of ABC we have the Jim Duke excellence in Botanical literature award we have the Norman r arth one of the founders of ABC one of the world's great pharmac cognizers are very illustrious and both of those guys were uh Lively fellows and characters in their own right but they were the two original founders with me as the board of ABC in 1988 so I had these two one people ask me sometimes what are you proud of stuff because was one of the liser questions you what do you and the answer is I'm not proud of anything except what my grandchildren do maybe and I wasn't raised to be proud I was raised to serve and that's how my parents were and my mother always worked in nonprofit organizations and you know her whole life she did was on Foundation boards and you know did all kinds of stuff started help start started a thing called drive a meal which became Meals on Wheels and things like that back in the 50s and 60s and I could go on about my mother who was an amazing woman who also helped helped get El Paso teex is our hometown have all bus stations hotels restaurants and public facilities were desegregated in El Paso Texas a year before the Civil Rights Act was passed that required all of that and El Paso Texas was the first city in what was the Old South because Texas was part of the Old South even though we're Far West Texas and away from the Confederacy El Paso Tex was the first city in the in what was the Old South to desegregate voluntarily for the Civil Rights Act because my mother and my uncle and some other El Paso citizens lobbied the city council to make it happen that's beautiful well you had good training early on sorry oh oh so so and then so we had other we have these other so yeah it's about service so there's these other uh organ people Freddy Cronenberg the Freddy Cronenberg excellence in uh research and educ and and education and botan and Botanicals and Women's Health award and other uh Awards so we had these Awards but actually the Freddy Cronenberg award didn't happen till later I'm sorry because I think your award came first and then Freddy passed but I wanted to do the award for you to honor the fact that you had started the California school of verbal studies and traditional medicinal tees and the Brighton Bush herbal Retreats and United PL savers and the sage Mountain sanctuary and the international herb Symposium all these seminal important parts of the modern American herbal landscape and all the books you've written and the classes you've done and the in your school and I wanted to do that and the board said okay we'll do it but we're going to name it for you I said no no no no this is about this is about Rosemary this is about Rosemary and she's a community Builder and we want to honor her for being a community Builder and we and and and then find other people and I remember Stephen in the board meeting step Foster who was on the board for 21 years and was chairman for 10 he may have been chairman at the time I don't remember he said you're a community Builder and the name is GNA your name is going to be on this award so and I told you this I I told you this when I apologize to you that I I I push back on it I put I didn't want it I didn't want my name on this award I didn't want it anything to be about me it's about the person not about me but they insisted and so I went a whole year we went a whole year without giving you the award whenever we when we did the awards ceremony for everybody else that year you were already preapproved but I didn't want to have my name on it so we didn't give it to you until the next year so we started a year later than we were supposed to because I was embarrassed and I I I felt embarrassed of that somehow that people would see it as self-promotional for me and it was not about me and I didn't want to be that so you know it's maybe a false humility of some sort or whatever but I just wanted to honor you and the board had different and so I've realized that if we didn't go ahead and if I didn't go ahead and accept the the nomenclature as the board stipulated I would never get a chance to honor you publicly and so we went ahead with it and then the next year we next year Sarah got it we did gave it to Sarah okay I always love your I appreciate so much every year when you send me a little note you know I get get to have a little vote in who I think and each year we always I think it's it's such a wonderful award but it makes it better because it does have your name on it you know and because you really truly are a community Builder you know and so it makes it wonderful when I have it I love I love my little award it's all filled with um I have that beautiful glass vase and it's filled with seag glass that Robert's collected so you can see it beautifully yeah you're not gonna drink out of it then no it's huge I to drink out of it yeah so um yeah you know I was going to ask you one of those questions like can all the incredible things that you've done in your life you know those things that are really well known and recognized all those little things that you do for everybody you know kind of behind the scenes I was going to ask if there's anything that you're particularly proud of and maybe I should take the proud out of it I loved your answer you know you're you're not proud you're proud of what your grandchildren do but those things that most grateful for maybe could you share with us what when when a a reporter from natural food merchandiser was doing a story on me for one of their you know highlighting things or whatever she came down she came down to Austin for two days and interviewed me you know for two days and one of the questions what are you most proud of for ABC for ABC and my answer was I'm not proud but I'll tell you I'm grateful and I told I was grateful for the fact that Jim Duke and norm farnworth and later professor Tyler were able and willing to sit down and put their name on the same letterhead with mine and start ABC and help open doors because at that time they were the silver-haired white you know Jim Duke was one of the top bists in North America he was the top herbal medicine expert at the federal government no question about that everybody knew Jim Duke was the most knowledgeable person in the entire federal government on medicinal plants he helped start ABC Norman farnworth one of the most world famous pharmac cognizes in the world it's a study of medicinal plants uh scientific study help you know they opened up so many doors for me and for ABC and for the herbal Movement by putting their name on board with us and seeing the vision that I had for ABC to have an independent nonprofit organization that was herbally oriented and at the same time spoke with some degree of authority about the SC emerging science at the same time respected the traditional historical record in the ethnobotany yeah it's beautiful yeah so that's gratitude that's gratitude that that's gratitude that's not Pride that's about gratitude so that's I think that's a much better a much better way to say it Mark and it's so beautiful you know that's one of the things I've loved in doing these interviews is just listening to the elders now honor their Elders you know like just looking back and realizing none of us got here on our own you know it was all you know standing on the shoulders of others and then just sharing that we all did so openly you know like just this amazing like whatever information we just wanted to share it with others you know and just yeah right yeah it's like we're teachers that that we still because I feel like I'm still learning I'm still a student people say what do you are yes I often say I'm a herb student I'm still learning stuff all the time and I have this habit of sharing it with people as I go along and for their possible benefit and use and let them share it as well so that's but it's that that's how herbal gram grew that's how ABC has grown it's always been about sharing the herb clip the herb clips that we just published our 9,000th you want to hear the story behind herb clip yeah I do I have that in my list so I we didn't get to it so please do I want to hear it I add it as a question so we I was sitting ABC's first 10 years were in my home which was a big 5,000 foot home on a golf course I didn't play golf I walked the course at night for exercise and for to be out in fresh air but I didn't play golf too much time I don't have that kind of time I mean you can ride an article the amount of time it takes to play around to golf so you can reach you know 100,000 people or something or 30 or or 20 people whatever you know whatever it is you write an article takes it takes you know three hours to play 18 hols of golf or more anyway so um so I'm sitting in my desk and Cecilia who's been who you had the first natural food store in Dallas who's my accountant has still been working with me for 35 years my wife just handed me a note that my our daughter's dog is may be dying it's an emergency I don't know what I'm supposed to do with that um oh so so anyway you know my do my our daughter uh adopts dogs she has like usually anywh from six to eight of them or 10 of them so she's adopting dogs and cats she's a Rescuers I mean wonderful people who do that I thank you for rescuing animals thank you so much for that any so I'm so herb CLI I'm sitting in my desk and talking to Cecilia who started the first after food in Dallas store and she us to import organic produce to to Dallas Texas from California before the certified organic you know even came about you know she would she was she's a Pioneer she's been our like our main accountant for 35 years and the other accounts been with us 35 years as well so I've really blessed with people who stay a long time our our leadership team at ABC of uh six people I think has average of 21 years per person on the leadership team that's right so longevity I've been very lucky that people have stayed with us you know and stay it's more than luck my dear it's more than luck so we're looking over the what we call the accounts delayable instead of accounts payable the ad the accounts delayable Department you know the that's like the Gonzo way of accounting back then we couldn't pay our bills you know fast enough and we just you know try to figure out how we're going to pay the bills and there's $600 to the copy or toner company why are we paying $600 in the copy or toner compan which represents like two months of toner so it's the 30 and 60 day uh balance 600 said well Mark in addition to all the copying you have to do for the organization's needs this is 1992 the organization's four years old she say it's all those articles you send your friends what happened was I would be reading an article in a magazine or a newspaper or a Jour a scientific journal or whatever and I would say it I would clip it I would cut it out and paperclip it to a note that said Memo from Mark with the ABC logo Memo from Mark and I would say hey Norm Jim Steven Foster Chris Hobbs um you know scientists and herbalist friends some you thr four five six people I thought you might find the interesting FYI again we didn't have the internet so that somebody had to go down to the photo copier oh my God photo copy five or eight copies depending on who's on the distribution list of the handwritten note and then there's a one-page article from a magazine or or or it could be an eight-page article from whatever or a newspaper and then photocopy it and then staple them or paper clip them and then fold them and put him in an envelope then address the envelope and to the postage meter and I didn't realize that sending these articles two or three or four or five a week created all this work Downstream and all this cost that I hadn't realized because I was just sharing information with people I was just sharing information and so I got on the phone and I called my old buddy Jim Beck of blessed memory he passed away a few years ago the founder of solar aray yeah when it was called solar out of his garage literally solar became solaray and then became neutraceutical Corporation it's one of the brands but Jim I said Jim how would you like to get a clipping service because back in the day you you you could subscribe to clipping services they would send you all the articles that they could find on whatever the subject is that you wanted they were right they were there was Allens and there was bacons and these were clipping servers that you know the business is subscribed to or whatever government so and these people knew the stuff because they didn't go to databases they were looking at hundreds of magazines and newspapers every day and looking for articles for certain clients that was the whole idea so I said how would you like to have a clipping service about herbal medicine information for your R&D new ideas regulatory uh marketing education they said sure how much and I almost said $100 a month and I stopped myself I bit my tongue and I said 300 bucks a month and Jim said fine send me a bill oh my goodness so then I called up Ken Murdoch president of Nature's Way and I had the same story with Ken but by this time I already had the $300 solidity because I already flubbed the 100 to 300 with Jim I called Kon he said how much I said $300 say fine so the first year I raised like 54 or $55,000 $57,000 doing that oh this bad habit of sharing stuff that was costing money the second year was like 83,000 and the third year was 118,000 so in three years we're starting to generate a quar million dollars approximately by clipping articles yeah to send to people for free we s it I mean they they paid for it and now it be it's a part of ABC we just published our 9,000 of those because now instead instead of just clipping we started this thing where we started summarizing the article yes in two pages three pages the summaries and the sum of the some of the summaries also are critiques and we will say the the study that we're summarizing could have or should have been controlled for this or that or this is a weakness so we do critical reviews and they're peer reviewed and it's all online now yeah yeah it's one of the great uh benefits of being a member yeah it is at the academic level and above and and the point of that is about doing herb clip was we were just sending out information and sharing information all it was and we couldn't pay the bill for The copier or toner and that's what generated the idea to try to figure how to go to another level with this and that's how it got born that's the story so I'm sorry long to explain that but oh no it's a great story Mark so I I think we have come to the end of our time plus I can see that you're needed by your family so you know just the end do you have any words of any more words of wisdom I should say to share with our listeners just anything that you want to close with at all well I don't know about words of wisdom let to share that I hope that everybody listening and or watching this uh enjoys the blessing of robust health for as long as possible and that health is truly a form of our best our best wealth I mean I remember my father for years saying you know you know uh health is wealth and it was you it was a platitude and yet we've learned in so many ways sometimes very painfully especially in the last three years in our country and around the world how important it is to maintain health and and to and and be grateful for our health at whatever level we are and to live in our lives in a such a way that enhances and and promotes that health and I we never got around to talking about adaptogens but I'm a big believer in adaptogens and if you ask me what my totem herb was was you were going to ask me uh jining is probably it because I started selling gensing I've been involved with ginsing for years I take jining on a daily basis I also take rodol and but I'm I'm I take adaptogens in a proactive way and that whole concept for how to live your life by taking things that help support your body's immunity and your resistance against stress and other kind uh that proactive build That's goes beyond tonic it's tonic is limited it's not it's tonic is in the right direction but adap is a another level and now it's become a popular term but I had a paper by the way uh I had a paper rejected by I think it was Journal of the American Medical Association back in 1998 they did a special really they did a special edition on alternative medicine and i' had been invited to write an article for them that basically doc talked about uh which herbs I would see had the best clinical documentation and trial that for Physicians to consider using this is 1998 and in my article and talking about jining and Cava and a few things and the clinical documentation for it at the time such as that was you know 25 years ago I referred to the adaptogenic properties of Jin sing Etc and the editor sent it back saying that peer reviewers objected to the term adapted adapt oh my goodness are you because this is a true story I'm using my words of wisdom time here to get sign off and I'm telling you another story this is true but this is worth worth being in the anals of the archives of the herbal movement probably from a historical perspective because they said there's no known it's not a known Western Scientific or medical or pharmacological term it is not a term accepted in medicine and they recommended the word tonic I said no it's not just tonic and tonic you say tonic I don't want that word because it's going to bring up the days of the tonics and the patent medicines and a lot of the fraud that happened back then I didn't want herbs to be associated with that directly because there's a bigger higher agenda here to talk about the legitimacy and the safety and the mounting evidence of some health benefits they may they may not be all the health benefits that are claimed in traditional historical medicine but they're documentable as health medic benefits based on more modern scientific research which should be good enough for you when is enough enough and uh basically uh that was the conversation so I said no adaptogen is an an appropriate term in European phytomedicinal literature developed by Russian pharmacologists in 1948 and 1952 they would not accept it and so I the article was never accepted because of the word adapted isn't that crazy I I did not back down and I probably should lament that because I could have been published in jamama back then if I hadn't but I just I I stood my grow I said it's a it's a term that's legitimate and we can qualify and explain it I'm proud of you for not backing down Mark I think that you know and plus it makes such a incredible story now because adapted is probably the most popular term at the world there you are ahead of the time again you know I'm so sorry that our time has come to an end because you know one of the things as I as we're talking I have a zlion more questions I wanted to ask you one of them just always love hearing stories of your family and your mom you know you know your mother was such an incredible influence in your life so we might have to do a part two of this well I just wanted I wanted to honor my mother for that because uh it's it's because it's about a tradition of service and being available to people and it's about the sense of community it's about being part of your community and it's you know there there's the uh Hebrew term tun Alum to repair the tear and the fabric of the universe and all of us are here to do whatever it is we do um to help repair the fabric in the tear of the universe in a way and you know everybody has their own contributions hopefully and you know it's like our Tombstone if we are not cremated or whatever it's going to have the birth year and then it's going the death year and there's that little inch of uh that Dash or hyphen or whatever you know and you know that is so much because that's really what you did with your that's your life in between days in between these days that's your life that's that one inch is your life so what does it mean you know what does that one inch mean for everybody gets that inch what does it mean for you what what is your contribution you know I still haven't figured it all out yet but it's F A when you do let us that's another incredible thing that you've done in herbal gram is you know and it's actually I love herbal gram for a lot of reasons there's such a tremendous amount of great information it's so well researched and do documented but I love that section that you have taken and just where you honor all the great people who have worked in the Plant World in the honoring is always so respectful and deep and beautiful you know just I mean I have to say I think all of us are helping I want to write before I pass away Mark please include me in the honorarium at herbal ground it's like such a offering that you give to the community it's important for us to know who came before us and who was contemporary with us now it's not just the people who came before us and the Elder El other elders but as people are of Our Generation that we're losing they're they're leaving yeah uh stepen Foster is one of many who are in the age of you know younger than we are you Rosemary I mean we know that I mean stepen was just on the his 65th birthday yeah and there's others I mean Ezra our friend Ezra bear and there's some there's people so what happened I just want to share something else I'm leaving Sunday this is we're on a Friday not that that matters in the tape but I'm going to a conference at Old Miss it's an annual conference he got the award too he's gotten the farth award and the uh Community Builder award Dr ichas Khan because he's another Community Builder he's built this community around this conference called International Conference on science and Botanicals at Old Miss every year which is Food and Drug Administration partially funds that conference by the way wow because his organization that Miss iipp is the lead place that FDA has funded for the analysis of medicinal plant materials and the development of analytical methods in the laboratory to make it to do analysis they're one of the top labs in the world on analysis of Botanical materials and this is a great conference so part of my talk last year when we start resuming after ex after the pandemic after several years that we were off this is going on almost 20 years so my talk last year was honoring the 40 some OD or whatever people who had passed who in the last two years since we've been together who some of whom had come to that conference regularly occasionally and it was a very different talk for me than you know anything about ABC and the market and the research and all the here quality control sustainability issues and I've gotten more comments and more feedback on that one talk than anything else I've ever done probably wow and it it get a nerve with people because people want to know about people and people and it's important to acknowledge and honor the lives of the people who contributed in so many different wonderful ways to our very uh very robust fabric that we call our herbal movement yeah it's beautiful well thank you my darling it's been wonderful just that's a beautiful place to end it on you know and I just thank you and just want to tell you that we are all so grateful for the amazing contributions that you've made and your beautiful spirit it just floods out you know and I look forward to the next Circle that I get to see you in you know I'll see you in
