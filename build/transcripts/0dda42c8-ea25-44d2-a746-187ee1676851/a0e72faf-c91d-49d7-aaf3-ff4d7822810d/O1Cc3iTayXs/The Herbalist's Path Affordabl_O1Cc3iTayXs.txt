so I also want to really thank you for inviting me into your home this evening and also coming into mine and yeah and just rambling um and ambling a little bit down this herbalist path with me I think there's really nothing that I love doing more than sharing my love of plants with others so I just thank you for this opportunity also I just need to let you know too that uh you know I do write notes down and I'm always a little nervous about what's going to come forth I'm never really sure never really look at my notes but always before I start a class ever I always just pray to the plants and I ask that um I can be a voice for them and just allow myself and my shyness and my insecurities to move aside so that I can just let that Spirit of the plants and Creator and nature move through me and my prayer tonight is that whatever Sparks come through me that um they can land in the good places in your heart and that those Sparks light a green spark that then goes out into the world and lights more green Sparks which is really how this green energy has spread so beautifully around the world so I think what I'd love to do right now kind of the message I just got from the plants is just to call them in so why don't we all just take a moment and close our eyes or soft focus just kind of shut off the world and just call in a plant that you feel particularly close to right now maybe it's a herb that you've been drinking as tea or some plant that you're growing or plant that's been calling to you or one that you used in healing just bring it in and just uh Envision it in front of you or inside you or holding o holding maybe you're embracing it over to your heart and if you have trouble doing this just have just imagine yourself as a child and let your imagination run free um but let's just take a moment I'm going to stop talking for a second just hold that PL close and give gratitude for it and as you're holding that plant close just take some deep green breathing with it it's my friend Pam calls it it's the green breath just breathe in receiving the oxygen that it provides for us and as you breathe out your carbon dioxide just recognize that's what the plant thrives on the plant utilizes that breath that we breathe out we're just going to take a few moments to do green breath with this plant breathing in and out and just giving thanks to the plants that provide air and breath and light and nourishment medicine and food for us and we get such thanks you know that we've just created this incredible Garden um you know our thoughts do absolutely create energetic inference as shamans and healers and Wise Women and wise men have always known that but science even recognizes now that our thoughts absolutely create energetic imprints and we've just created this amazing energetic imprint of a thousand plants healing plants going out into the world world and that actually is incredibly powerful and empowering especially at a time when we know the world needs um this energetic imprint of goodness and healing that the plants give us so I want to thank you for that yeah so I know that I'm speaking to an audience of people many of you here are herbalists um you're practicing herbalist which basically means you're just practice being a being a plant lover being an herbalist some of you are want to be herbalist you know might be studying right now or really thinking of becoming one and some of you perhaps are not even sure what being an herbalist means it sounds good right it's kind of popular right now which is interesting um but so you know I always like to just start off by um saying there's probably many many definitions of herbalist I I always like to look at what Webster Mr Webster Daniel Webster said about being an herbalist so Mariam Webster says that herbalist is a person who works with plants for healing that's A and B is a nalist also grows and gathers and and works with plants so in a more General sense and healing is basically defined by Webster as creating wholeness and restoring and renewing and so all of us who play with plants and work with plants either as gatherers or harvest gatherers Growers medicine makers and all of us who are working to create more homeless in the world in our families in our bodies and in our communities in the world are already practicing herbalist and there's so many different ways that we can be practicing herbalis so we can be like my daughter and son of heart Jeff and Melanie Carpenter who have zoods Herb Farm and grow medicinal plants they're healing the Earth by doing creating um a better management of the soil in restoring soil and then creating these wonderful herbs that go out and people make teas and medicines with them and my good friend Christine Shaham who's a holistic Beauty practitioner who puts henna on people's hair and transforms their hair but also transforms how they feel about them and uses this incredibly healing plant henna she's also practicing her girls right and the mothers and fathers in their kitchen who are you know maybe making their eonia buying eonia from their neighbors who are growing it and using that for their children and their families are also practicing heris and the clinical practitioner who's studied long and hard and understands anatomy and physiology and the pathways that these herbs work in the body um is also a practicing her blist and the cook who takes all the magic from their garden and transforms it into healing food is also a practicing ous so there's many many ways to practice the skills and the Art of herbalism um if you love I I call my name for herbalists really are plant lovers and to me the most important part of being an herbalist and a plant lover um is developing a deep and personal relationship with them and they guide us on the path of how to be our kind of herbalist so yeah I think that's the most important thing is developing that deep and personal relationship with the plants so it really becomes the plants become the communicators and the the teachers for us and of course we use books and we go to classes and we go to conferences and we go do online courses because that all guides us and as humans we understand human language um maybe a little better than when we're first starting to understand plant language but but plants reach out to us and they absolutely would teach us through their own language it's it's yeah I always say my good friend who who has since passed away Stephen buer used to call it the Lost language of plants but it really is not a lost language it's a forgotten one that we have to practice hearing but all of us all of you who spend time with plants you know out in the garden out in the woods in your kitchen in your closet when you're cooking when you really are paying attention to the plants you actually begin to hear the language of the plants um and you can engage them more by just talking with them yeah so there so so how to how to practice herbalism um one of the things and develop relationships how we develop relationships with plants is very much the same with how we develop relationships with people it's by attention by intention and by spending time together it's very hard to develop deep and Lasting friendships with people without taking time to develop those friendships and so what I like to do is engage people in in using PL every day in their lives in all the various ways and I I'm just going to share some of these ways with you you know one is by spritzers you can make these really simple little spritzers they're so easy to make but we don't we are Hill and I are going to share some fun recipes with you but we don't have time to teach you everything tonight but you could go online you can look at books I have all of these recipes in my course um they're readily available and every one of them is like every one of the things I'm going to share with you tonight is like three steps you know do this this and this and you've got an incredible product so spritzers are aromatic blends of plants um that you use for cleansing the room you can call them room fresheners but I like to think of that these herbs they are room fresheners but they go in and it's plant energies are entering into your space right you can spit your body with them you can use once you get to know your herbs you can actually formulate the herbs you want to put in you can use them for stinky areas in the house you know um today before we started this class Helen and I we used a special wand to kind of cleanse our energy and open our hearts and then we Spritz the area so all kinds of ways that you can use these and you and you can formulate ones that are um cleansing and purifying you can formulate ones that are uplifting to the heart that help to heal a broken heart you can you can formulate ones for abundance you can have so much fun doing this and also I love to make um to use plants in wands um and these can be they're sometimes in traditional cultures so they're used all around the world by the way by cultures all around the world and they're given different names um so I because uh we're trying to be so appropriate about um not using the uh things that might be cultural approach appropriation I call them blooms or wands but in the cultures that I was taught by the elders who taught me they taught taught me they were called limpas or smudging and so you know I just gather local plants this is made from the cedar that grows out in on our property you can use lavender or Sage the garden sage that grows out in your yard any of the aromatic plants and you can use them simply for just cleansing your energy again it's I want to say that it's fun but when I use that part word fun I don't mean really lightly I mean in a in the way that it's joyful it's just a wonderful thing to do you know before you um you know teach before you do anything that feels like importance to you before you sign contracts before you get married before you go to date you know it's to cleanse the energy with these sacred plants and as you get to know the plants more and you develop relationships with them you begin to hear the plants telling you which plants to work with so um you can make these beautiful limpas um the broomsticks they're called brooms um or wands um also I love making herbal dream pillows you know and so that way all night long I'm sleeping next to my dream pillows this is one of the very first things that I actually taught students to make way back in when I first started teaching in 1972 make dream pillows and go to sleep with your herbs because things you sleep with you get pretty intimate with generally so um you know you you can again the formulas are simple you can just take herbs that you have you have lavender and chamomile um hops is really good to put in but just to make these beautiful pillows and these also are really good for gifts for people this is a gorgeous one um I've had for a while now but it's all hand embroidery and it's really beautiful and then just other ways you know as herbal bathing you know making a beautiful blend again with just simple common herbs um it could be lavender and chamomile and uh those are just beautiful combinations comfrey is another one and then when you get out of the of the um of the bath or in the morning time it's using anointing oils in they past anointing oils used to be really important they were used for kind of uh using using oils that were lubricating for the body but the herbs in them were also healing or beautifying um and so the anointing oils you just get up in the morning and after you slept you take your shower and then you just take your oils and you just rub them on your body before you get dressed and it's just again another beautiful way to bring herbs into your life on a DA way so and of course teas you know you start your morning with your cup of tea you end your morning with your end your day with a cup of tea and when you make these teas I know so many of you begin them with coffee and end them with coffee and coffee is another outstanding and incredible plan it's definitely very medicinal and it has purposes it has lots of medicinal uses but it's very very overstimulating for a lot of people um and especially in these very aggressive times that we're living in very very stimulating times when you drink so you can have your coffee if you need that coffee to get your day going but then somewhere midm morning stop and have your cup of tea and when you drink that tea and even when you drink that coffee do it with this deep intention it's not just hly drinking you want to really allow those herbs to enter your body and so again it's really developing relationships with these plants this is the way that you learn to be a really incredible practicing herbalist is and by developing these relationships with plants that go very very deep so I I want to also share with you that many of you are are probably much more practicing herbalist than you imagine so like if you for instance cook and you turn around and you look at your kitchen cabinet with all of its culinaries some of the world's best medicinal plants are in the kitchen already and just to give you an example I just wanted to show you I just randomly chose a few of them and I I'm watching Helen because she's going to give me the time because actually when I start talking about these plants I could ramble on forever really about any single one of these plants um I don't know if you can see this beautiful platter these are just common plants I have in my kitchen and you most likely have them in your kitchen so what's the difference between a culinary and a medicinal herb it's primarily in the dosage and one of the really important things to realize is that all of the plants plants the herbs and spices that we think of the culinaries were not put in people's food because of the flavor most of them are pungent and bitter it's not really that they taste good it's just over centuries we've become accustomed to the flavors when we add these spices and herbs to the food now it's familiar to us especially if they're part of our ancestry um but they were originally used in cooking because they all have medicinal properties they either ate at digestion they help with the you know digestion of the fats and the oils they helped preserve the food there were M there were particular reasons why those potent concentrated herbs were added to Foods so just you know randomly I'm just going to quickly talk about these and if you do want to have any more information on any of these herbs you can always get this book my medicinal herb book a beginner's guide um because I talk about all of these herbs in quite detail each one of them has a chapter so garlic of course this is probably the if I had to choose one herb in the kitchen and one herb as a medicine it would probably be garlic um on every level I love this I mean it's just an incredibly sensuous fiery hot plant it's delicious in food you can bake it cook it it just enhances and Seasons everything but also it's one of the most important medicines that we have it's was called for a long time the poor man's penicillin it's a powerful anti- bacterial agent and antimicrobial agent it helps enhance the immune system it's good for the circulatory system it boosts the immune system um yeah on every level just and cooking with it you know what people often wonder if you cook with it do you destroy the oils you destroy a little bit but it's very potent you can taste that you know you can taste the potency when you eat it and in fact garlic is so potent it actually even though it's a common culinary and an herb that most people use it does counter indications for some people it actually can be stressful to their digestion because it's too hot and if you're a very hot type person which is seen by your you know the red glow on your face or sometimes big hearty people who have a lot of deep color in their face and sometimes they they get roused easily and they get overstimulated and they get get angry really easily garlic is not a good herb for them because it adds heat to the body and that may be one reason I love it so much because I tend to be very cold so I love this herb because it warms me up but this is a great herb for the winter time right now you know you should be eating it a lot and cooking with it so medicinal and culinary herb and then another one of my beloved favorites is sage and this Sage I grow myself and I dry it a lot this Sage can be used as in the wands for smudging um and for cleansing but it's an in and we use it in cooking though not enough you know I I think this herb could be used so much more in cooking it's very uh deeply pungent and warming and drying to the system so really good for winter illnesses and in fact when you study the medicinal properties of sage you find out that it's used for a wide variety of issues where there's excess fluid so we use it when there's coughs and colds when there's lucara the whites drippy white stuff um we use it for what's called night emissions which is kind of a term but it's um yeah premature ejaculation not good for night sweats is another thing so when there's excess fluid also when there's it's also used for drying up mother's milk um it's not an herb that we ever recommend for nursing mothers but when mothers want to uh stop weaning their CH start weaning or stop nursing their children they just drink like sometimes one cup of tea a day will help to dry that milk up so when there's a lot of extra excess fluid it's my number one favorite herb when there's a lot of infection in the throat and in the um and in the bronchials and then I forgot almost forgot to mention that for any of the menopausa women those hot flashes power flashes that you get this is a really good herb that helps regulate um hot flashes it can reduce them and also helps to regulate uh that hot angry feeling that sometimes happens when we're going through menopause am I going fast enough you got about five few more minutes and then of course we have time another common culinary that's just enhances almost everything that you cook with right and um it also is another herb that's really really good for wintertime imbalances um and it's also a very good herb for use for the um endrin gland system and particularly for the thymus gland it's really interesting there was a wonderful uh U professor and herbalist named Dr Paul who taught out of the uh University of of uh Santa Cruz in California and he was particularly fond of this plant and he uh would make this time Sav and then he would use it to put over the thymus gland which is right here and he would tell everybody to do the thus th it was kind of funny and amusing from this extreme especially coming from this extremely educated a professor but actually scientifically it was proven that it actually enhanced the thymus gland which of course enhances the entire immune system so uh you can do the time of stump with your with your time sap but it's also a really excellent mix and great syrup and yeah it's good for so many things and then we have Rosemary which of course I have to speak about it's um one of my names my namesakes so I'm especially fond of Rosemary again a common culinary or people always ask me if that is my real name and it is I was named after my grandmother's Ro Ros and Mary gladstar is my old hippie name from the 1960s by the way but um but so this is a powerful antioxidant and it also has uh known to be an excellent herb for helping with memory it's one of the herbs that has been scientifically proven to feed the brain the brain it actually crosses that brain blood barrier um it's a powerful antioxygen it's also really excellent for the cardiovascular system um a really nice uh kind of uplifting stimulating herb using it for all kinds of Anguish in the head you know like when you get headaches and migraines and your memory gets a little foggy you know and you need just a little broom sweeping up there um you can use rosemary this way but I usually suggest it as a tea or a tincture I have a very famous brain tonic that I've been making for about 30 or 40 years and um I've taught thousands of students how to make it and uh it's a really wonderful combination of you can probably find it any of my books are on our online all of these recipes are on our home study course and in many of my books and then of course Ginger and turmeric um and cayenne those are the other ones I wanted to sneak in and talk about but you know more than anything I just wanted to share with you that when you use plants in cooking all of those herbs that you're using every single one of them has a long history of being used as medicine they're usually the ones that are cultivated and have traveled with humans as they as different nationalities have traveled and are some of the very best medicines that we have so it's just learning a little bit more about how to use them as potent and valuable medicines so um yeah I'm GNA do a quick look and see where I am on my notes um yeah so I I also just wanted to take a moment um before we translit into doing the the sharing recipes with you to just pause for a minute and um just think about all the very many ways that plants enrich our lives and you know I must always speak about that if any of you have ever listened to me ramble on in the past I almost always bring this up because no matter how many times I've said it and how many times I've heard it it still impacts me very deeply when I really just think about the plant queendom for one thing um plants are one of the oldest living species on the planet just plants um they were here no matter what your creation story is the Bible story The you know Turtle Island rising up the Big Bang whatever it is you know that your belief system tells you is the truth plants were always here before humans and and really one of the first living species on the planet and and what that means for us is that they are ancient creatures of beings and they have they have tremendous survival skills and not only survival skills not only can they have they outlived cataclysm events things that we can't even imagine right now you know like meteorites pounding into the planet huge eruptions volcanic eruptions and plants are the first things that come back and colonize that volcanic soil um huge floods that have lasted for hundreds of years right and then when the waters reside or the oceans reside the plants come and colonize they're colonizers too um and the plants not only survive but they thrive in such a way that they create food and medicine and clothing and shelter for all other living beings so not just humans depending on them plants um are everywhere on the planet every nook and cranny highest mountain deepest ocean desert plants colonize everywhere and everywhere they go they create Beauty and that just gives me you know just it's amazing and plants actually are the largest living mass of any other thing on the planet they account for greater weight and greater space than any other living thing on the Earth it's kind of amazing when you think about it yeah um plants stand out in the sunlight and gather all the food most plants there's a few that don't but the 95 majority of plant they gather ancient sunlight from the Sun sunlight that's millions of years old and they transform that into matter that they use to grow and Thrive and when we eat plants we're actually eating ancient sunite it's kind of amazing so our medicine our food our shelter and I mentioned this when we first started that every our the air that we breathe is the out breath of the plant and the air that the plants breathe is our out breath so that in itself is the reason why we all want to be herbalists today you know we all want to be plant lovers we all want to study and honor and work with these ancient beings that are our elders and our teachers and those plants will teach us in so many different ways how to serve them back so yeah I'm so excited that we are all talking and walking on this herbalist path so another fun thing to do with plants of course and and this is one of the steps I'll talk about this later like how we become practicing herbalis um is by making things with them by by creation and so I was gonna invite my dear friend Helen to come you could start sweetie a thank you Rosemary so much for that so we have three really great recipes for you this evening and we'll share them and one which Rosemary created just for all of you um which is really exciting but tonight I'm going to speak about oxymels or shrubs um and an oxl is literally acid and honey if you look up the word um so it's apple cider vinegar the raw apple cider vinegar and raw honey um and the benefits of both vinegar and honey so vinegar is um alkaline so it helps our body fight off infection it increases our digestion boosts our immune system and many people who you know might not prefer to take the vinegar um this is a great way to add the sweetness to it so it calms it a little so this evening I'm making an Elderberry um shrub for you and the difference between an oxl and a shrub is oxymels are really working with plant material so um I was actually listening to a beautiful podcast this um my ride here today and Rosal Lee was sharing that she makes an oxel with th um which I thought and another one with dandelion um I love making shrubs because my husband is um non-alcoholic and it's a really fabulous way to really um stay away from some of those mocktails that are so sugar Laden um he really loves you know so I use old fruit not old fruit but fruit that um might be on its way out a little and so it's a really fabulous way to um work with the the fruits in your um in your refrigerator or your kitchen that are I've made them with peaches uh peach and blueberry shrub is really beautiful but this evening I'm going to make an Elderberry shrub so these are dried elderberries um and the recipe is a I like to use a mason jar and when you're making any medicine with vinegar you'd like to use either a plastic lid or make sure that you use a lid that if you use the metal lid you can put a little piece of wax paper and then put the top on because the vinegar will corrode it's it causes the metal to rust a little faster so you put in um about a quarter of the jar of the dried plant material and oh look at that it's about perfect how much I had and then you cover it literally it's that simple and the recipe um there's different re recipes out there I encourage you to adapt uh this is a great way if you like something a little more sour or um a little sweeter you can add a little more or less but the recipe that we're sharing with you this evening is um one part of vinegar to one part honey um and so literally you and you can heat this on the stove not bringing it to a boil but if you'd like to put it in a saucepan and put the herbs in and then cover it with the honey and the vinegar and bring it to just a a just below a simmer and heat it up and warm the honey or you can add all of your ingredients and set it in a warm place so tonight we'll add one part vinegar so I'm going to put it to about a third of the jar and we'll add one part of this beautiful raw honey which also has the medicinal effect so we'll add another third and I'm eyeing it I chose not to measure um yeah and my way with both of our ways um and literally then you top it and and as Rosemary has taught me well um I always shake my intentions in prayers whenever I'm doing anything um to speak about Elderberry a little and rosemary how she started so beautifully of calling a plant in that we love and have a deep relationship with Elderberry is one of mine um I think as herbalists and plant lovers we have met each of us maybe but um I would say that Elber is definitely an ally of mine it is a perfect one for this time of year because it boosts our immune system so making an Elderberry shrub is a an excellent way to really be um taking your food as medicine and making these beautiful mocktails or spritzers and uh it's a preventative for the cold and flu so it's an antiviral um and so when you shake it then really just shake your intentions your prayers um into this beautiful medicine and then you can place that thankfully it didn't Shake purple all over your kitchen you can I'm very grateful for that so so you can um then let it sit uh for two to four weeks or a little bit longer if you'd like and then you may strain it and bottle it um if you use fruit that is really kind of Juicy like I was sharing before and you're making a shrub then I do put this in the refrigerator um if you're using dried plant material then it is shelf stable so you do not have to refrigerate it and it's um good for about six months so then you can put this in a warm spot and make sure that you label it and date it because we always think we're going to remember but we forget um and then the beautiful thing is once you've made it then you can enjoy it so we have a little um Elderberry spritzer that we're g to it's an Elderberry shrub that I made and bottled and now we um put it in a beautiful glass that you love and think of all the medicinal aspects of it so we have a little Seltzer here um we chose plain Seltzer um you could try a flavored one I think adding a little lime to this um the other thing I would like to share is I use this often for my Tails as I was saying for my husband really great non-alcoholic um uh Alternatives now ritual is one of them there's many um in fact I just read an article that a friend of mine just opened a non-alcoholic bar in Burlington which is really fabulous with all these Botanical spritzers and so Cheers Cheers yeah cheers so all of these recipes they're going to get right so they don't have to like yeah so you'll receive them in the I think um our team is sharing them in the in the chat Del honestly it is so incredibly delicious yeah and and healthy for you yeah and you can basically make these medicines this this shrub or um or oxy Mill and you know the term you I use them interchangeably by the way they're the same thing honey alcohol and herbs but um when you're making them with fruit technically it's a shrub that's kind of the technical difference of them but really I usually I like the term oxy milk it's kind of the name yeah and it comes actually from hypocrates time when a hypocrates who's considered the father of modern medicine but truthfully he was an herbalist and a naturopath right he he used oxy Mills a lot and he used them in uh and it was originated in the ancient Greek days that term um and it was one of the favorite ways that he gave her is making these uh these acidic and then sweet oh it's just I wish we could share it with each of you but you get to make it it's so super easy so the next recipe is even easier and it's another one I just love this I I've taught how to do it in my herbs for winter health class many many years so if you've taken that class anytime in the last 30 years you've made this but it's again just super easy um it's a it's rose hip jam and it's made with dried seated rose hips the rose hips have to be seated otherwise it won't work they they're they're usually I usually buy them deeded um and most herb stores sell them out way if you have a lot of rose hips you can sit and deed them yourself but really believe me I've done that I've done that been there and now I just buy them already seated because it works so much better I forget who taught me how to make this recipe I think it was one of my students but regardless I'm forever indebted to them so um what you do is you just start with your with your Des dried rose hips you fill a jar a small jar about halfway full excuse me you don't want to make this in large amounts because um it will store in the refrigerator for about four or five weeks but you do have to refrigerate it because of there's nothing in it that keeps it shelf stable so and all you do is you have a good apple cider I don't like to use apple juice in this I want a good apple cider you can get them Frozen year round this is one like our good friend Nancy Phillips made so anyway and you just fill the rest of the jar with it leave it just fill it up to the shoulder because it's going to swell up a little bit and then put your lid on oh and let it sit overnight one thing I did last night when I made it so this is last nights and I don't know if you can see it it comes out this beautiful consistency and you can spread it on toast and use it with pancakes but quite honestly you can just lick it off the spoon because it's so good A little spoon for you thank you I think it's incredibly delicious yeah that's all do you just put it at room temperature let it sit overnight what I did with that one um is I just took a big teaspoon of my spice BL that I use you know it's it's kind of a blend of delicious pumpkin pie spices and vanilla not vanilla and um cinnamon I put a lot more cinnamon a little ginger in it so it's just a spice blend and I added like a couple big teaspoons to it and I thought it made it even better you know you can just have fun in your kitchen the first time it's good to just make it like the recipe says and then the second time you make it you can do it any way you want isn't that good it's so delicious yeah so you just shake it up that's how simple it is this is a fun thing to do with your children right it's that simple they can make their own rose hip jam um rose hips right it could be from any roses so long as they are haven't been sprayed cultivated wild the Wild Roses are generally going to have more bioflavonoids in them and vitamin C very rich in that but your cultivated roses will work as well so long as they're not sprayed so yeah another very simple recipe so delicious yeah so good I know I I just am so indebted who to whoever shared that recipe usually I try to remember but not always so the last recipe I wanted to share with you I was I was just playing last night and actually I didn't I sent the recipe to Emma who'll be typing it out and sending it to you tomorrow just late last night I think it was around 11:30 I was thinking about the holidays and how fun it would be to make some holiday trungle balls and so again just super super simple recipe and these are the ones I made last night I don't know if you can see them can you see how cute they are little balls and this one's like a little heart shap I don't know if you can but they are cute and so um you'll have a recipe um and I I I'll just quickly show you how to do this so I just started with um I had a p a cup I'm going to take a half a cup of cocoa butter the cocoa butter is actually it's it's not oil it's butter you can make it yourself it's made with Co the whole coconut so this is the whole coconut that's been kind of ground and then whipped and whipped into a butter and it is used like butter it's kind of Rich um and nice but it's it's not the oil if you use just the oil it just is too melty so I used the butter and I bought this butter but you as I said you can make it yourself and then I added of the oil to it so just a nice organic coconut oil goes in there and I just Stir It Up and that's kind of my base and then I added a little of my homemade vanilla which is super easy if you've never made your own vanilla for one thing it's so much better and so much stronger and then what you buy and also so much less expensive but you do have to let it sit a long time I usually let it sit when I'm making it for about seven or eight months this is from last year yeah I always have batches of vanilla going and I steer that in and you can also use like a a a vanilla paste or vanilla sugar but that little bit of vanilla just adds a nice flavor to it you can also add cinnamon and um I see I did add spit cinnamon to it so you can add I tried adding cardamon which I thought would be absolutely delicious but it just it didn't come through so a nice bit of cinnamon added to it Yum Yum Yum Yum and then what did I do next then I added a little sweetener and you can make it sweeter if you want I add it just about three tablespoons honey would you have me a tablespoon please my hands are greasy so I may need you to open that I had it open you can make it a little sweeter but I didn't want it to be overpowering so I found three tablespoons was just perfect and I also um made some with maple syrup you can use date Sugar you know you can use different sweetener for it but I I think I like the honey best of all actually so we're going to do that one more spoonful there we go good medicine yeah that's good and then we're going to add the herbs and the urban formula that we use for those of you who already know know a lot about herbs you can add any formula that you want to this you can make an aphrodesiac formula you can make an adaptogenic formula you can make a stimulating formula um the formula that I made here was a mixture of of Aranda and uh I used Aranda and little andrai mushroom powder and Mauna or velvet bean which is very uplifting to the spirits it's kind of opens your heart and greets Joy um and uh I used a total in here of about eight teaspoons which gave me about um um let's see if I did eight teaspoons it gave me about 16 I wanted each ball each little candy that I made to have approximately a half a teaspoon in it so I made about 16 balls so I had about eight teaspoons I explain that on this on your recipe that you get the amount of herb formula that you add to it is going to be dependent on how many the size of your balls I tried to find a better way to say that but I just couldn't so there you go so it's about a half a teaspoon of the herbal formula per dose um is a really good amount and these herbs have to be finely powdered they don't work if they're not powdered so what I'm going to today is I'm going to add medicinal mushrooms to the formula um so these will be a little bit more medicinal and I'm gonna add about yeah because that so full yeah I'm gonna add about eight teaspoons again which will give me so this is a mixture of five different medicinal mushrooms and I'm just going to add those it's a lot but remember when I divide them into the that's not enough when I divide them into the balls each ball will have about a half a teaspoon in them and and that will give each each of those just about the right amount so it's a lot of herb but the base covers up those bitter or musty or earthy fa flavors so it's kind of neat how it works and then to thicken this I add a nice raw cacao powder to it so and I add a total of about it's really about 2/3 cup but depending on how loose your balls are oh dear this is getting bad welcome to my kitchen right um You can add a little bit more a little less of the cacao powder so um you can also add which I didn't I added it at the very end but you can also add like Goji berries or little walnuts or cranberries you know you can you can get very creative with this formula though if you're not used to using working with plants or spending a lot of time in the kitchen if you follow this formula just the way it's written down it will work really well for you so I'm going to show you what I'm going to do here here let me mix a little bit more and then it's almost perfect you can see I've got it getting it really nice like this and then I have these little plastic gloves and before I put the plastic gloves on and just ring that BL of that together I just want to sh with you just some of the oh if you don't mind H that would be great and I can if you I can put this on but I just wanted to show so you can also add you can buy formulas like here's one that um my good friend AA does it's for the mind so you can make a nice mind one you can use you can do the mushroom mocha powders or the hot chocolate powders and I just use a good a good powdered cacao a raw cacao unsweetened in this so you can really have fun and just kind of play with the formula and add different things I hope that's not confusing to you but that's kind of how the herbis is in the kitchen you you have a basic recipe and you have maybe not every single ingredient and so you just kind of play a little bit the idea is to create a base that tastes really good that covers up the taste of the medicinal plants that you're using so that looks beautiful trying to add yeah we'll add a little bit more and then what I'm going to do with these so I can roll them into balls I can coat them in my rose sugar this is a beautiful I don't know if you can see this but it's a beautiful rose sugar that I made that's um powdered rose petals and I just mix it in it's dried powdered rose petals and I mix it into an organic sugar so it makes it really nice for I'll just take a little piece here and just show people so it makes it really nice just make a nice little ball or a square or a heart whatever you want and then you just roll it in the sugar or you can roll it in coconut I have the coconut here and and then the other thing that you can do is I love these silicone molds right so you can see here I made these great little heart-shaped ones which are really fun too but what the other thing you could do is just take these little molds and just you just do a little press just I'm going to put the sugar right on here you see how nice that'll be I just sprinkle my little Rose sugar that I made you can have lavender sugar whatever you want these make wonderful gifts and these because of the cocoa butter in them they won't melt at room temperature they get a little soft but so um so I just press them in here I just press it into the mold just like that and take off the excess I'm not going to do them all I do just a couple of them to show you how simple and easy it is I put them in the refrigerator to harden over the evening and then tomorrow when I wake up I'll have a little box of beautiful us leaves that I have that's pretty I know it is they're beautiful actually they're really fun I think that's good we'll do one more because I don't want to take everybody's time up plusy mold here we go so I just have these little molds like that I just press them in and then I'll pop them out like I did with these tomorrow so herbal truffle balls you can make wonderful formulas using different herbs you can make one that's stimulating to the mind you can make an immune if you want to make medicinal ones which is what I did with the medicinal mushroom one I made one that um like I usually take my medicinal mushrooms and I mix them in with my tea in the morning but this way I can have my tea in the afternoon with just a nice little medical mushroom truffle ball Helen try one and tell me what you think along with your little Elderberry Dr other sure so yeah really fun delicious I know they are good I would love to be able to pass these around to all of you right now and have you try my little holiday truffle balls but this recipe was made just for this class so enjoy and I hope you have fun making them too okay oh thank you so I think the next thing I wanted to talk to share with you a little bit about M do you have anything you want to add just about intuition I think that one of the things that Rosemary was just sharing and what I know about herbalism and working with the plants is really to encourage each of us to follow your intuition and adopt the recipes you know so making them the way and that you know the way that you created it and formulated it and then you know trying to work with the plants and and trying new things and following your intuition right and again for those of you who are new to working with plants there's always that insecurity of like which herb to work with and which one and what do they do and I wanted to just take a moment to just address that right now like how do you begin walking down the herbalist path you you love herbs you want to you know you want to use them to help with your health with your family's health maybe you even are thinking about it as being a career you know you know maybe being a community herbalist or going on and studying deeper and doing this work as a clinical herbalist or you may already be involved in healing work being a nurse or a doctor natural path and you just want to work with plants more so um and you know I started off by talking about developing a deeper relationship and and how we in order to deepen relationships we have to spend time and create intimacy with those we want to be in deep relationships with and definitely with the plants you know they they Thrive um and we Thrive when we're in relationship with the plants it's a it's a wonderful co-creative relationship but I did want just share with you like some really easy steps for those of you who are just starting down this path so that are very comfortable and I know these scks work because I've literally guided thousands of people in the years I've been teaching on the herbalist path and I've seeing hundreds of people become really incredible practicing herbalists just following these very basic simple steps so if you're starting that this is the beginning of your path for you the best way to start is with a few herbs um I would say 10 I always say 10 10 seems like a good number we have 10 toes 10 fingers 10 herbs and um I always am reminded of a of a quote that my one of my very dear friends and one of my very early teachers Dr suo Brook said to me he goes I'd rather be the type of an herbalist that knows 40 uses of one plant than the herbalist that knows one use of 40 plants and again he was talking about just really getting to know your plants so I would suggest choosing ten herbs and those can be the culinary herbs because as you as you know these are all incredibly powerful medicinal as Wells being safe Edibles um if you're not sure which 10 herbs to start with I would just guide you to this book has and other books as well but this was designed this book was designed to walk you down that herbal path and to take you deep into it um so just choose 10 herbs that and those herbs need to be widely available common inexpensive easy to get or grow found in your backyard in other words the common everyday herbs and you'll find that these herbs are often the best medicines for the everyday illnesses that we encounter so choose your 10 herbs and you need to have them in your house you need to get like um an ounce or two no don't get more than that because um start with an ounce or two you can IDE grow these if it's growing season um there's so many good herb stores today and online sources where you can get really good organic um and ethically harvested plants right so um and now the steps you have your herbs you've made a list these are the 10 herbs I'm going to start with um and I can give you a list but the thing is it's better for you to just kind of think of the 10 herbs that you want to study you know echesa Yaro garlic Sage th Rose Rosary chamomile anyway I just gave you the lavender Valyrian hops anyway and now you have to first of all do your research the research is in three books at least three herb books so not online sources Because unless you know your herbs really well you won't know which online sources to use so and there is some good a lot of really bad information so get three books that are um recommended and you can we have a list right they can always write to us and get we have a really good list that we happy to give you and and so you're going to spend just just a few minutes maybe it's 20 minutes you're going to look in three books not just one because you don't want just one person's opinion you want to read the various ways that different herbalists have used this plan so you've during your research and your study and that's going to tell you how safe the herb is does it have counter indications you need to be worried about how you use it if it's too hot if it's dry and pungent if it's moist it's just going to give you some Vital Information information great and then the next is experience information means nothing unless there's experience to back it so the next step after the research is after you have the little bit of information is you sit down with your herb and you try it by itself it's called a simple one single herb and when you drink that tea you're going to make it as tea and when you drink that tea you're going to thoughtfully ingest the herb let it sit in your mouth so that you're actually allowing your taste buds to to taste it and to feel what it's doing and then follow it as it comes into your body really literally just pay attention and you if any of you are really so inclined you can invite the plant into you you can again have conversations with it or you can merely just drink it it's going to have conversations with your body and you want to make a note of your Sensations is it hot dry is it soothing is it itchy is it making you feel good is the energy moving upwards or downwards you're going to notice things about the plant so after you've done that little experiment with it experience with it excuse me now you're going to experiment now you're going to start using them for different purposes so it may be that you're getting a bad headache or you can't sleep at night and you've done your research on these plants and you know valaran or hops will help you sleep or lemon bomb you might have be having just kind of a down day lemon bomb May lift you up roses are heart and heart opening right so you'll begin to experiment and to see how these plants work and the one thing about the experiment I have to really impress with you is that herbs absolutely work or they would have been discarded eons ago there is no doubt that herbs work that's why 82% of the world still uses them as a primary source of healing they are incredibly effective but they do not work like drugs so if you are used to taking an aspirin and it aspirin will interrupt the pathways of pain right blocking them so the herbs don't necessarily do that they're going to work in a different way in your body it's a entirely different system that could be compatible with modern medicine but isn't a replacement for it it's its own system of healing um and you'll explore and learn about that more but um so th that's really the way you know and then that I just recommend you start with 10 herbs you research them you sit down quietly you can do it with your friends you can have conversations how's this herb impacting me you can do it with your children or you can entice your partner to do it with you that's always fun um um and then then I would say you know as you begin this relationship if you can at all grow the plant or learn them grow Where the wild plants are growing that is really another vital thing is getting to see the plant in its living being um and also engaging with other herbalists you know like I have to say you know in my world of as a plant lover I've been following this plant really since I was a young child and and seriously as a profession since I was in my 20s it was like in 1972 is when I opened my first herb store um and I have found joy every day in this work and in part it's definitely because of the plants they are they r mediate positivity and joyness and empowerment and and a powerful energy but it's also the people that work with plants I just I am so honored to work with the people who work with plants other plant lovers it's an amazing amazing community so I want to invite all of you to you know really build that community and I think that's one of the things that we really try to do with our online course you know it's it definitely I started writing that course in 1981 it because I had started the California school studies which was one of the first herb schools that had reopened in the United States I opened it in the late 1970s it's still running actually in somoma County where I started it and I had hundreds of people write to me you know saying they couldn't come to they couldn't travel to California to go to these seven and eight month programs and so I decided I would travel to them and so I wrote this course that was based on the classes that we taught at the herb school um and you know it was designed just just like the courses at the herb school like these inperson classes to take people deep into the heart of herbalism and to teach them all of the basic skills to be practicing herbalist for Home and Community it is not a clinical course it's it's not a course that will teach you to be a clinical herbalist a medical herbalist but it will teach you how to use herbs for medicine in your home and with your community so um yeah it's a pretty amazing path and for all of you who are listening who you know considering joining us on this path and you know learning about I just couldn't encourage you enough especially right now when the world needs us right um in so many levels and we need the plants on so many levels I just think it's you know I think I want to say one other thing before I pass the speaking stick over to Helen is that you know oftentimes people used to say that there was this Resurgence of interest in herbal medicine and you know we want to recognize that always there was the migrant communities and Indigenous people and even um you know poor communities of people who were still using the plants a lot but really right around after World War II herbalism went deeply underground in the United States particularly but also many other developing Rel countries and it it existed underground quite well by the way um and when it started to resurface which was like in the late 1960s and really came you know kind of like came from under the ground up again A lot of times it was said that was because you know people were dis disillusioned by modern medicine or um this disconnection with nature that had happened and we were striving to get back to Nature and I do think that was part of it we needed the plants we need we were you know people became interested again in this incredible system of healing but I don't really think that was the reason I think the real reason I think that was a reason but in my experience of working with plants it was really because of plants were calling us home because they need us to protect their wild Gardens again to protect the Earth and that when we really develop you know and cultivate a love for something we stand up and become a voice for it so and you know the plants are really speaking through us so yeah thank you so much and thank you and I just wanted to also thank you all for being with us this evening and speak a little you know our team um in the the course that Rosemary created the science and art of herbalism in the theme of this evening about affordability and accessibility it's and just kitchen medicine I can't speak enough and How Deeply honored I am to do the work every day that we do but really I mean this um uh Rosemary has so many gifts in the course weaves this magic through it and one of the things that our entire team you know based on Rosemary's you know deep mission of affordability is that the course and the teachings in it really um speak so deeply and around herbalism being the people's medicine and and I can't it is and I you know and so those recipes um the other thing is she spoke about you know the community that we've built and one of the honors for me and I think I can speak for our team in the work that we do every day is really the community that we have online and and even the students that are our print students or you know might want to learn from the binder and not necessarily study online but the the rec curring theme from our students is how well connected they feel to us so even though it's a a long-distance course I love that know I'm very proud of that so um so we have a special discount for you that we'll be sharing um again we can't thank you enough for joining us this evening it's a a real deep honor for me to be here with you Rosemary and to be with all of you I wish that I could wrap myself around each of you and introduce ourselves in person and I hope we do someday um and I think Rosemary has a special closing for of us this evening so enjoy your your special the winter solstice and yeah you know I I did want to share with you a a couple I'm an advid reader right and I used to be able to keep up with every herb book but there's so many incredible new herb books that are being written by this amazing remarkable new generation of herbalists that they also deeply inspire me but I want to tell you about two books that I'm reading right now these are not herb books for information they're herb books for inspiration but they're written by the brilliant um uh Italian uh ethnobotanist herbalist Stefano manusa planting our world if you love to read about plants this book is magnificent it's just so inspiring and he also wrote the book the nation of plants so Stefano makusa they're my my new favorite books that I'm reading and then uh before we jump into the question I just wanted to leave leave you with this poem I've read it many times so you may have heard it but if you're like me I could hear it over and over and over again it was written by an elder named Maria Sabina she was an herbalist A Healer and a sha Shaman from the aatala tribe in Mexico and she was also considered one of Mexico's greatest uh poets um and she never took credit for her poetry she always said it was the mushrooms and spirit that spoke through her she was also a mushroom kirar and used um mushrooms for as her vehicle to speak to Creator so you can close your eyes and listen to this it's so beautiful and this is for each one of you so um cure yourself with the light of the sun and the Rays of the Moon with the sound of the river and the waterfall with the swaying of the Sea and the fluttering of birds heal yourself with mint with neem and Eucalyptus sweeten yourself with lavender Rosemary and chamomile and hug yourself with the

happier heal yourself with beautiful love and always remember you are the medicine you are the medicine thank you Maria that's beautiful thank you each one of you so yeah questions thank you for being with us happy holidays to you celebrate rejoice and um yeah we hope to see you again yes thank you everybody and now we'll take a couple of the questions somebody asked the name of the bar that serves the mocktails in Burlington oh and I believe it's called tonique from uh Lisa Danforth she was a caterer who actually lived um in the valley but try it I think it's going to be fabulous because she was also a caterer and a shadow we should um a couple people asked oh Rosemary what book of yours is the best for building an herb garden um I would say probably um medicinal herbs for a beginner because I talk about growing each of the herbs but if you need a book that really covers it growing in depth this isn't the book I would recommend Tammy heartt tongues um her last name is h a r t u n g she's written several books we have one on our site yeah we have one on our site so you can go to our site and we we have one on the site and there all published by story publication but she has some really excellent books for beginner herb gardeners and also if you already know a lot but yeah her books are great I would suggest those for the gardening with the plants really and then Colleen asked how do you make the time Sab that you recommended so you so a basic Sab recipe which is a one cup of vegetable oil we usually use olive oil to a quar cup of beeswax those are melted together but before you melt it you take the oil and you infuse the th in it so you would um let's say you take half a cup of thyme dry or fresh and you cover it with a cup of oil and over very very low heat like at a double boiler you might want to cook it for um two or three hours till the oil becomes very infused and so there's really good instructions again in my book it's like a basic recipe and then strain the herb and you add that bees wax to it um yeah it's that simple just and you can also do solar infusion where you put your Herb in a jar and you cover it with I don't have a jar here but you would just cover it just so it's covered with the olive oil and let it sit in a warm sunny spot it will not go rancid so long as the herb is in there it's magic and then after a week or two or even longer strain sitting in the sun you strain the herb from the oil and then you add that beeswax as I said it's um really just looking online or looking on my on um the Mountain Rose website has a really good basic Sav recipe so Sav recipe is one cup of herbal infused oil to 1/4 cup beeswax and you would be using th that gives you an awful lot of time so you could cut that recipe down by about a quarter really believe me cuz a cup of Sab will last you and your community for a you know a few years sorry about that I hope that gives you enough information and then Lisa asked does dehydrated garlic still have healing properties well it depends how it's dehydrated you know if it's un low if it's really high heat um and it's if it's low heat and it feels and taste and still has a really strong garlic taste then it's going to still have medicinal properties the the oils and the garlic are really strong even though they're volao oils they're not usually easily dispelled so and I think you all know this trick I kind of ignored it for a long time but truthfully it is true when you when you're cooking garlic um it's good to chop your garlic and let it sit for a few minutes because the Allison actually develops the medicinal properties as it sits so chop it let it sit for 10 or 10 minutes or just not even that long just a few minutes and then add it towards the end of your cooking don't add it when you're doing your sauté of onion and stuff you add your garlic more towards the end so you get more of the flavor of it yeah thank you and then Mindy asked will your course go into formulations oh yeah it definitely goes into formulations formulation is one it covers all of the art of herbalism and formulation is definitely one of the Arts of herbalism I use that Triad method to teach my students the main point you know your main intention support and a catalyst so yeah we go into that and if I may she's a master formulator master formul you know when you work with anything right but when you work with plants you'll have knacks there'll be just things that are natural for you you know like some of you will be excellent at gardening and some of you will be excellent at formulating and some of you will actually make incredible products thankfully not all of us are excellent at everything or nobody would like us right but I'm really good at formulating and I love this question personally because Gia asks if we have an online connection in community and the answer is yes we have forums in our online Laura actually the course teacher who is um supporting us this evening and answering your questions I believe in the chat that may or may not have been working I apologize I don't know but she moderates and manages the the forums and we have very active uh the students who are in there um answer you know ask questions and we share recipes and things that are going on in the herbal Community I I would want to say one thing about that course is I think we're one of the few courses that still reviews all of your homework and student who wants to do the homework um which is projects and question answer with each lesson we actually still review all of them write down our answers and send them back we do it both in print so a lot of people will still do the print version and also online so it's kind of I don't know that there's many that do that people keep telling me no no no you have to do those ones that they have online where you just answer Choice yeah by the machine answering and I would just never do that it's like no way it's not a good way to teach herbalism well in my mind actually and then someone asked and I'm not sure of this answer can you substitute lemon juice for vinegar well they have different properties they're both they're both acid for certain but they have very very different properties one is lemon and the other is Apple and an apple and a lemon have very different properties right and when you press the juice the juice is going to have very different properties the other thing is lemon juice is not stable on the Shelf where apple cider vinegar is a shelf stable fermented product lemon juice is not fermented so you can substitute when you want an acid like in your tea you could put lemon I guess you could put apple juice or apple cider but um there are very different products with different properties I hope that answers that for you and somebody Julie asked if there's if you can share the difference between a community herbalist and a clinical herbalist oh yeah totally very different so a a community herbalist is a person who um kind of wears many hats they may garden and make medicine and they may help their Community with colds and flu and all kinds of health issues but a clinical herbalist is going to be more like a medical herbalist they're going to have study physiology of the body they might be the main resource for a person who's going through cancer therapy or has diabetes Etc a community heras can help with those things for certain but they're not going to be the primary uh health care professional working with that person oftentimes clinical herbalists will work in offices with doctors or naturopaths um so it would be you know I and this is just my own definition of it you know I see a community herbalist as helping more with the more common kind of issues that we have and be a support person for that person but I like for myself I consider myself a community herbalist and when somebody is dealing with cancer and a cancer therapy I can be helpful and add support but I'm not going to be their Primary Care person and and possibly not even their primary herbalist I would recommend that they see a clinical herbalist who's trained in anatomy physiology really like a medical practitioner or a doctor would be they know about drugs they know about so counter indication of herbs and drugs I know which herbs not to use with certain drugs but I don't know what the counter indic Pati are going to be with all of the different medications and I certainly don't know much about drugs I'm not interested so but a clinical herbalist would know all of that so there are there're are clinical professional who has studied herbalism instead of allopathic medicine is that Define that's my and our dream of having an herbalist in every home on every corner yeah totally yeah I think that's that's all the question questions oh wow there weren't even very many well there's more there's many many many more well let's do two more okay so Irene asks is there a good Sab for children's eczema yeah I would say absolutely um so I would use colula comfrey and St John's worth that old the old it's called an allpurpose sa you may have a different one but I love colula um for skin problems St John's W is really excellent and comfor is so soothing and healing so it's kind of a what they call an allpurpose Sav but um I've often added C also my son it really calms the redness yeah he does and it it helps the heat do you use it with the other herbs or just by itself I've actually made the blend with the camomo in it yeah so it's a it's a common formula I think it's in my I'm sure it's in my book because I've been making it for it's the first Sav I ever made actually so it's an equal parts colula comrey St John's word and thank you Helen Helen was saying um that she uses tamile in that form formula because her son has eczema so and if it's really really aggravated we've learned the um Rescue Remedy cream oh or putting some Rescue Remedy in the saff it works so well just to reduce the inflammation and when it's aggravated so Rescue Remedy is another branch of herbalism their Flower Essences that you can make um but you can also purchase them anywhere and actually anywhere in the world they're sold so Rescue Remedy is one of the flower essences an angel asked that she has a 12-year-old daughter we just completed Rosalie's course and we love to learn from you oh do you have um young ones join you as well yeah we actually have had many um and Rosalie's course is excellent by the way I love Rosalie we we're very good friends um yeah um we have had young ones growing GI studying with us I mean we have a a good amount of them actually right now probably I'd say anywhere I mean I would say maybe five active students who are teenagers right now and Helen actually has taught the young children um she has had some apprentices whove worked with her and U I love that age it's a really special age yeah there's a wonderful book um I'm sure that your daughter knows that but it's a kids herb book by lesli Tiara oh that's a fabulous it's one of my favorite actually I love it as an adult book actually it's just a wonderful wonderful herb book just full of projects for children in that age group younger and older you know in that age group so and one more question okay Susan asked can you talk about how the course works the system of how you designed it well you can you want me I mean okay so it's um so there's a print version which we call the classical print version um because it is very classic and then there's the online version which is um has a lot more information because we could you know it has videos and slides and uh guest teachers and stuff because we can include all of that kind of stuff on the on the online and and they come you can buy them separately so it makes them very very affordable for people or you can buy them together and I'm sorry I think I missed I would have answered that I'm so sorry but I think what she really meant specifically was the lessons in the course and how the course flows so there's 10 lessons Okay so there's 10 lessons and each lesson is designed like a day in the herb school so you you go and there's an anatomy phys physiology like we cover a body system we don't go into that in deep deta detail but we talk about the basic structure and how it works and then the herbs you've given a list of herbs it's usually 10 six to 10 herbs that you do your research on that's where you build and you create a material Medica and then there's also a fun project there's always um something that's kind of like I would call um like just added interest you know it could be natural Cosmetics it can be herbs for Animals it can be Flower Essences it could be aromatherapy so there's just another subject that's just like a um added interest that's part of herbalism there's always a section on a um a medicinal preparation so that you learn each lesson you learn how to make a different product we start with te's of course the basic water preparation then we go to savs tinctures and on and on so you become a good medicine maker and to share it's a really in-depth course that Rosemary created you know honestly each lesson is um is probably anywhere when we say lesson so the the course is a binder you know that's like this big um it's three years to complete the course yeah me some people complete it quicker but and they the gift of each aspect of herbalism is that Rosemary weaves in the Materia Meda for each of the body systems and each area of herbalism that she's teaching about so that she as she was speaking earlier from my perspective um is that you really teach your students how to have that deep relationship with the plants which really then brings such a um a foundational understanding and knowing for working with the plants oh yeah and it's it is a very in-depth course um you know so each lesson I I would just like to yeah well I was laughing about that because you know online these days you know everybody wants to rush through things we'd really see a big difference you know that you know can I do it in three weeks or something you can but you know you could read it like that but it's not designed for that so we do have people that finish really quickly but it's very shallow most of the you know herbalism quite honestly is a lifetime study you you never never learn at all and never you never stop learning which is why it's so fascinating incredible so you know my intention was always to take people on a journey on that herbal path that really does take them to the very heart of herbalism and builds a solid foundation so you know people have gone on to study clinical herbalism after taking this course or open herb stores or become you know product manufacturers and stuff because because as I said you find out the path that you want to do as you're working with it but um yeah it's just interesting you know how people think that they can learn it all in six months I I wish but no so um we usually encourage people you know somewhere in a year and a half to three years um they usually have completed though we do have people who have you know really done the work well and done it faster if you don't have anything else going on in your life you don't have kids or a job and you have a lot of time on your hands you can dive into it and get it done in a year but usually put it in perspective of everything that we do in our lives that usually takes about a year and a half to two years to finish and you have we give people up to three years and then you can renew your subscription if you want of course at a discounted price yeah and in the spirit of Rosemary's Generous Heart she includes hundreds of her own recipes that she formulated and also you know the the herbal protocols for common ailments in each body system that she's teaching about which I find the print version I reference that all the time yeah you know it really is like a lifelong reference book so anyway thank you again yeah thank you yeah thank you so much I'm sorry if we couldn't get to all your questions but um we so appreciative and yeah thank you have fun on the herbalist path and we'll see you yes said we'll see you along at
