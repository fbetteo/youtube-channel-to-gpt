people are always great i was just thinking about that plant and then it just showed up in my garden and i'm thinking well people are not aware that they've had this ancient relationship we're genetically connected to these plants and we've been evolving with them for thousands and thousands of years the plants were always here before humans which make them our teachers and our elders they're very wise beings so right here at the edge of the garden is the elder mar and they were planted there because they protected the gardens they were the protector of the gardens so it's nice to have an elder on the edge of your garden watching over it and then coming and getting your elder berries to make elderberry cereal syrups and your elderberry flowers so pretty and beautiful we're just drinking that happiness fills our hearts makes us joyful joy is a very important element right now in the world is challenging for so many people it's good to keep the joy levels up you
