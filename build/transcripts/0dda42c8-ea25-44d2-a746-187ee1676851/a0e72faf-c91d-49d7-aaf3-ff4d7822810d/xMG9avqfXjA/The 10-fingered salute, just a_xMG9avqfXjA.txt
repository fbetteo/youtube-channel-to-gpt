when we're calm and relaxed we tend to have more energy and really I think in our culture we need to focus more on relaxing nerving than we do on the stimulating we'd have a lot less angry people on the freeway I always imagine in the morning time you know if you if you were in rush hour traffic in Boston for instance or New York City and everybody was on lemon bomb or chamomile instead of coffee I think we'd have a much friendlier population instead of honking and beeping and screaming and giving each other the finger they'd be w they'd be giving the five finger salute maybe the 10 finger happiness
