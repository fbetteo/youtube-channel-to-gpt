when you first work with an herb uh an herb that you maybe think is interesting maybe one of these herbs that we've been speaking about it is always good to try it as a simpler remember that simples are one herb at a time because that gives you a chance to experience the way it taste it also gives you a chance to experience how it works in your body and what what it's doing um it's also good to read a little bit about it so you have a good understanding and then you can formulate it so it's you always want to try the herbs by the cells so with how I know this about all of these herbs how I know how they're going to work together in formulas because I've taken all of them by themselves and I've grown most of these and I've worked with them and so again that's the level that you want to Aspire to just to have an experience with each of these and the deeper and the more you experience them the more you'll know how to work with them so look at that isn't that really beautiful
