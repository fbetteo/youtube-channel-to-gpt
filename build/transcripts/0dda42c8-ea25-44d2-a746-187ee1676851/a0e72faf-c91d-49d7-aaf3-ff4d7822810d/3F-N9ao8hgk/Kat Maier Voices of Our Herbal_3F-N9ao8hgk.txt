hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began the herbal War who and what inspired them their favorite plant and healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do [Music] and I can feel the sky [Music] I know that I'm part of the Earth [Music] I am thankful to be here so my welcome guest today is my dear friend and fellow herbalist cat Meyer cat is the founder and director of sacred plant Traditions she's been in clinical practice for over 30 years and is a beloved and respected teacher at University's conferences and Herb schools worldwide one of her Great accomplishments has been to train critical herbalists to have gone on to open their own apothecaries herb schools and clinical practice Kat is a founding member of the non-profit Botanical mobile clinic which provides accessible herbal medicine to local communities and she's the author of The immensely popular energetic herbalism which is rapidly becoming a textbook at many herb schools and also the co-author of bush medicine since Salvador Island Bahamas cat is a passionate Steward of the plants and served as president of the United plant Savers and she was the first recipient of the organization's medicinal plant conservation award and there's so much more I could tell you about cat but you can find her full bio on her website and also on this podcast so Kat thank you so much it's an honor and a joy to have you join me today absolutely Rosemary igu Elementary uh without a doubt this is going to be so much fun and I love that you really are doing this because we're realizing that archival information and our stories and you know we're aware enough now to really have these archives live and so this is such a brilliant project so thank you for doing it thank you honey well you know I was seeing our dear beloved friends passing on and just realizing we are those elders and that it's so important that that we capture some of these stories so yeah yeah so you know you and I have traveled together we've taught together at conferences and schools and served together on the board of United plant Savers and we've been friends for I think over 30 years but I was trying to recall how we met and you know I actually couldn't remember do you remember our first meeting where we met how well I remember the first time we physically met and I'm not certain maybe I told you this story uh maybe it's in the intro to my book but it's quite a profound story that I I really love telling students um in the sense that so I was in the Peace Corps and uh which was fabulous and you know growing up I was healthy I didn't grow up with any herbalism there was no plant medicine in my world and my mothers or even grandmother's world and I didn't have a lot of experience with them unfortunately so when I went to the Peace Corps that was the first time that I was given these herbal teas and plant medicine was alive and thriving and um so there's there's a story of um you know coming back and this will lead to my my introduction to you but when I came back from the Peace Corps you know I thought I was going to work in International Development and I went to DC and I went to graduate school and public health and you know I was on my way to really make these changes and preserve traditional medicine and I had this existential crisis while I was in graduate school because for some odd reason like the second day of graduate school I found myself elected to the president of the student council which I didn't know you know I had to work I had a life this is the last thing I wanted but so there I was in DC and I thought you know it was all research it was all research paper and development so I thought we are living in the city where all of these organizations exist so I put together this file and I went around all these ngos like about a hundred ngos and I was interviewing um anyone I heard me about development in third world in healthcare and public health and I said you know do you really believe that your work leaves the paper and you know gets into the village and it was amazing the honesty of not really or sometimes and this was before I was really aware of that whole savior you know white people going into third world and I wasn't aware of that but something was not feeling right um so I left graduate school and I went to work at this Wilderness school which is a whole other story but that was amazing but I finished that and I'm like plants you know I went to the Wilderness school to study plants wow and what next and I thought how can I save traditional medicine in Africa if we don't even have any like where's our traditional medicine so literally out of the blue in on this mountain in Strasbourg Virginia the California school of verbal study brochure showed up and I don't really remember when have I told you this story a long time ago I remember a little bit Yeah so it was when you all sent out those incredible brochures that were a calendar oh yeah you said the whole calendar and it had all the days and all the field trips and I got this and I was like oh this is I I can't believe this place exists and again I did not I had really no background with herbal medicine so I called the school immediately and lo and behold you answer and so I kind of didn't know I was like oh is this Rosemary and I kind of didn't know what it all meant and you know how you put these things out to the universe if this is there and if this is there then it must be right you know we're we're testing spirit and we kind of need different affirmations so um uh you said oh you should come and this is great and you have a place to live and here's this a friend of mine Gretchen and Gretchen was my sister's name and anyway so I went through this whole process and in the end my notion was still to serve low income to get into low income with a rural or Urban and I just thought how am I going to bring this medicine to these people or to this population or to these communities and so I chose you know another path and that's when I became a physician assistant um because I thought I could work in rural clinics then I'll learn herbal medicine and that whole story is interesting in itself but after PA school I went to Niha so I became a physician assistant went back to the mountains of Virginia because that's where where the plants were calling me yeah you know I still hadn't had you know real herbal training but it was the plans so I was feeling very isolated very alone we had no online there wasn't this incredible Instagram Community yeah and somehow or another I found about out about Niha and I'm in Virginia so I drive up to Niha and that was the first time I met you oh my god meeting and you when you met me you just shown your light you began inviting me to conferences you know it was that sun in my seed of teaching and herbalism you know just as you do and just as your grace you know allows things to grow um it was in some Community Building uh that maybe 20 of us were gathered for the weekend talking about um Niha stands for New England herb Association the Northeast the Northeast Northeast right yeah so the southeast girl had to travel North to find her flock but um that's the first time we met that's a long time you know when you're telling these stories this is one of the things I love so much about just sharing and listening is to these old stories is the memories just come back I remembered that and the Northeast herb Association was formed because when I moved to New England from California I I recognized right away there were herbalists in New England but they hadn't come together they it's like they didn't know who was in the holler next you know who was over the mountains so it was an opportunity to bring us all together so that we could Network and learn and share with one another and the you know also I remember when you were at that Gathering because the light that you carry just beamed out right it was like I think it was two beams beating each other you know we're on the same path we love it first sight love it first sight yeah um so definitely and then you know we've used your curriculum in our school and and then you know the rest is her story um after the conferences and um you know yeah so yeah you mentioned your physician your physician's assistant training which is really unusual among herbalists and I know that you've talked about it oftentimes how it's just allowed you to kind of bridge the medical world with the herbal world you know and I I think it's really amazing how you know you've used that language and kind of Incorporated it into your herbal practice without deluding your practice it's been more like a tool for you do you mind sharing a little bit about that and how you've managed to to weave and bring these two trainings these different very different modalities but greeting them together into like a holistic form yeah thank you um yeah I I consider myself a recovering scientist uh I love science I love uh that lens you know I I really think that that is the true psychedelia of our planet when we think of constituents and fractals and that whole molecular expression uh it's very very Cosmic that truly is the cosmology and so in my um it in my path and and trying to put together uh what does it mean to be a Healer you know the The Original Seed was when I was six in the Catholic school and you know Jesus was the archetype and I I didn't have Buddhism or Hinduism and it was how are we healers and it wasn't a religious life but there was always the seed of the Sacred but how do we translate that and how do we learn the language where we can be most effective so during that time I thought well allopathy you know the majority of our populations going to clinics and um allopathy is the predominant language if you will and so I went to PA school at Hahnemann interesting it was Hahnemann medical school it is in Philadelphia um and and they had this teeny little glass cabinet off in the corner of the lobby um with a homeopathic remedies um and of course there was no mention of Homeopathy but I did go to Hahnemann and I loved it I absolutely loved it was intensive it was two years and they said you know we can do about 80 of what a physician can do and the PA program was born out of the Vietnam War because there are all these incredibly trained Medics they're coming home they have amazing skills but how do we help them merge and integrate into the community and that was one of the origins of the PA program so you got you know deep dive into some great clinical skills and I really sort of wanted to be that country doc where you can stitch and do a whole lot of things so that was an intensive two years great internships and so I'm returning to Virginia and I send out all these letters to doctors um you know I had a dream I knew exactly what mountain to go back to I came back and um and I sent all these letters and and I would have been you know phenomenal it was a woman I was days are a lot cheaper like I checked all the boxes right you don't have to pay a visit the PA as much and so I I got all these notes just oh thank you we'll keep you on the file and Etc and then I had another dream that I went to this old old healer who I had known in Virginia and he said well you have to come to this Herb Farm and I ha you have to meet these friends of mine so I went to LA dama Maya Herb Farm in Luray Virginia and it was this moment of wow you know this is it wow so I would say that you know we have a dream and then there's this dream dreaming us and when our dream and the dream dreaming us really merged there's this incredible you know synchronicity it's that moment that's incredibly right and it was against everything in my body I made minimum wage I didn't even have money for gas to go back over the mountain I had a spend the night in this no crazy old Victorian house they taught me biodynamics they had their Herb Farm and biodynamics so you know I had this nice little plan and and I'm sort of telling this story uh gearing it towards you know the younger listeners and how do you find your way on the path and you know it it was um you know I had this plan I was going to be a PA for like five or six years learn all the rashes learn all the techniques that I would need a little minor surgery and sometimes major surgery um and then after I get all of that skill set I'm gonna go then do the plans but you know you know how it is I do a dream the dreams just are impactful and they're not convenient you know it's that Inconvenient Truth in a way but I don't want to allude to that but um so there I was I was the beginning of my training and then I studied in the mountains and we've all said this as older herbalists without so many teachers easily accessible we really Apprentice to the plants yeah you know so I'd have my job and I'd go into the mountains and I'd take my books and you know we just knew the plants we were with them all the time yeah and just studying them and then you know you'd have Norma or you there were definitely teachers without a doubt I'm not trying to say it was a complete desert but you know it took that was 30 years ago New England yeah you know to realize oh my goodness there's more of me um so the part of the PA is that's a language that's you know a magnificent language and so truth be told I mean I have worked as a PA some um kind of stepping in in mutual Aid and different actions and the demonstrations they kind of put me into allopathy table Yeah because they didn't have a lot of the docs that happened in Standing Rock um but uh the way I thought I was going to use it was really different but what it did was it enabled me to speak a language that allowed people to arrive and feel safe yeah oh she knows what ulcerative colitis is she knows what this these words are I could send them back and so in some ways it is that bridge and that isn't so necessary today because all of these incredible clinical programs they're doing deep Dives in amp and you know they're getting all of these skills and you know but that's taken another an evolutionary time and so that was the intention and I also really wanted to learn about the medications because I know that that's all part of our life and it was also the discipline of it yeah you know it was sleeping morning noon and night I mean the interview was so incredibly rigorous yeah and so it taught me that rigor and it doesn't matter what it is whether it's taiji or herbalism um there's something in that process um and the science you know is just so mind-blowing it's and and it teaches you know those energetics polyphenols all the berries all the antioxidants they're cooling oxidation's Heating and so you then translate the energetics into what those chemicals are really saying it's just like learning how to speak more than one language right you know like so many of us really know the language of English and and that language is so limited and then when you expand that to learn other languages it actually allows you not only words but also expression and feeling so and I love what you said I agree also like there are are a few herbalists who are amazing Bridge Walkers who really know and understand allopathic and modern medicine in the language of that and also Bridge walk into the natural world and what you've done I what I love so much is it's not only just into the herbal world but it's you take it even I would say even deeper you know kind of into the Earth and into the heavens so that you really interweave Spirit and the dreams and and then you know our our sacred plant medicines and into this marvelous like system it's very very beautiful and you make it accessible to people like every Workshop I've ever sat in and I have sat in a lot of your classes is you're able to mingle these traditions in a way in the languages in a way that it makes it easily understandable which I think is why you're such a wonderful and popular teacher you know you take the heavens and you breed it down into this marvelous technical language and then ground it in the earth and then make a feast out of it so it's pretty beautiful thank you yeah it's it's absolutely our our Birthright and sovereignty and uh it's just super cool it's like so amazing it's like Jim Duke you know he went in to dedicate his life with science to prove these Amazonian wonders and wizards and you know it is that language and I think it's funny even a holistic framework Body Mind and Spirit sometimes I feel that's still separating yes you know oh Spirit doses well it's physiologic it's the same and um so it's just so interesting to see the evolution and um I don't want to say maturation but it's really more of a consciousness you know we're really entering such a profound Consciousness around the plants so true so I wanted to ask you uh you know just have you share a little bit about the um botanical mobile clinic because it's you know I know there are several of them that have been started in this country and it's just such a beautiful model and I know that you were very instrumental in helping create this and I know it's something that you're also you're very involved in and also very proud about so do you mind sharing a little how that worked and maybe even how it began love to hear that story yeah absolutely I'll try not to make the origin story too long you know how we are with our stories um so I think it might have started when I had my first crush on Lorna Mana Braddock yes and her work I want to say crush on her work I want to honor her and respect her but when I met Lorna who was an atlanta-based herbalist and now she's mostly in Dublin um I I watched her mobile clinic in her VW van and then her work at the Harriet Tubman um clinic and she was doing footwork like serious serious foot baths foot healing for unhoused people and her theory was you know their feet are their home they have to walk they have to they have to have foot care and so diabetes and like some serious things so she was outraged just you know what Lorna did she grew up in Atlanta during Civil Rights her parents were amazing activists wow so she had this in her genes and uh just a brilliant herbalist and so yeah when I saw that it really sparked kind of taking me back to that that Peace Corps that service you know okay I have my practice I have my school and then you know it's white students and you know really looking at the populations in the communities and and how do we gain trust and gain an invitation so I learned a lot from Lorna she was our mentor and so we started the free clinic and it's hard because you know you really need that invitation again to avoid that kind of white savior going into certain places and saying oh let's give you free this or free that it's so incredibly inappropriate so it's about relationship and it's about that connection and really getting into the community and having authentic relationships and then saying oh you know this is what we do so our first place that we worked was a place called on our own and on our own was this great facility where folks were leaving Mental Hospitals and residential programs and they were on their own for the first time and it was a daycare place so you went in and there were AAA meetings NA meetings you know is safe place and so we set up a clinic there and I'm telling you well I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole with stories but that was amazing and then um um and oh before that the pulse Massacre um happened in Orlando and when I watched Emily Ruff or dear beloved Emily Ruff how she mobilized and how she gathered her community I said let's let's do that so Emily came up and she I have we had a training session and she taught about how to work with grief care and all the issues it was absolutely brilliant and then the white supremacist Invasion Nazi invasion happened in August of 2017. and so the timing was pretty impeccable that we had these resources of how to go into these incredibly vulnerable places and community and how to work with a deeply traumatized community in that realm um so and then during covid and black lives matter in Richmond we did a lot of Frontline uh work with the protests and I learned so much there is this amazing a native woman Vanessa who was in Standing Rock I met her there just amazing woman um so I just served her yeah you know one of the things I've learned is um especially as an elder to go find who is the elder here and how do I serve you and I don't and I'm a Scorpio and I got control in my genes a lot of places and and the hole and a hawk just came in and sat down so emphasizing that control letting go of control this stunning Hawk is right out the window right now so what Vanessa did was um I just served her I said what are your names and so we did a lot of prison packages we did a lot of it was marching during covet you remember those times it was incredibly Brave so I love Botanica when I was writing the book I kind of passed it on um and so it's been quiescent a little bit and now I actually just had a meeting and I said okay well what's going to happen so they busy lives you know volunteers super busy so I'm gonna take it back and I'm just dating now like Spirit where where do we go what are their needs um so it's still profound we have a huge Apothecary and um we're starting again in that relationship that's so beautiful I love how you're always listening to the dream world cat it's so beautiful yeah thank you for sharing that because I think it's such a great model for you know many other communities in this country there's a there's one that started in Sonoma County as well that it serves it's really beautiful actually I think was created by the Latino Community there it goes to all of the farms and provides uh both herbal care but also many other different modalities you know and it's all free care all donated so yeah we're starting to see that happen you know and it's people taking you know taking the initiative you know communities taking the initiative yeah let's talk about the individual plants right now like I I always love hearing about that aha moment and I know there are many aha moments when the plants grab us but is there and I know the stories come to us at different times but just at this moment is there like a aha moment that you can think of when the plants just called you to them you know like where you just you know where they just kind of saved you and welcomed you into their magical world well I think I'll leave the black cohosh story for the book and I'm not trying to sell the book but if people have read that story um you know I think I just really have to talk about chickweed I mean it's just such an amazing clan that you know called to me early on I do tell the story in the book but you know I was who really taught me a lot of my herbalism was the Mennonite Community here in Virginia really and I work with a midwife and my Midwife friend was really my herbal teacher um and talk about dream world talk about Scorpio this woman traveled other Realms I mean she would wake up before the phone call get her tea get her basket you know and ready and be kind of out the door and so she was so amazingly in tune in so um she did a lot of Mennonite Birds because you know this was not alternative medicine for them if if you know they were hemorrhaging they did not go to the hospital this was a strict community so this was the teaching that we had to summon all the forces and we had to be heroic I mean this was heroic herbal medicine and we used a lot of John Christopher's foreign that blessed I mean I loved his first book or so anyway so I had a lot of those clients so they would come to me as a herbalist um and there's one beautiful young young couple King brother baby their baby had this horrific impetigo you know maybe three days old gnarly just kind of the purulent and this Hawk is just so all over the window here so um and heat and just so intense and they weren't going to go to the doctor and so um I had had this dream about chickweed the night before I thought I don't know I was a young herbalist you know I I hadn't worked especially with infants right so I went I got the chickweed we gathered it from you know our yard my yard um uh chopped It Up made a compress put the compress on I said I want you to wait here you know so they sat we had tea I'm telling you I have no stock in chickweed um when we took that compress off like two hours later purulent it was still red and it was still raw but there was Challenge and so they drove a long way but I said you've got to bring her back in the morning I really had to stay close to it and I couldn't there was a reason I couldn't go driving that chicken anti-microbial anti-infective clears heat energetic and I have used it so powerfully for so long um and it's so amazing and it tastes so good oh my gosh I know it's out around here we've been kind of snipping it first yeah so there are many aha moments but I just so love chickweed because it is so available yeah I think I can hear at that moment when it happens because chickweed is such a mild herb you know you never have there's no counter indications for it at all and yet it's so powerful and I absolutely love that you shared with that because chickweed to me is one of those plants that currently is so overlooked you know and it's such a healing powerful soothing plant you know it's just so available yeah it's great I always love knowing which plant just steps up and says aha this is what we can do so that's a great one so you know again this is kind of an odd question but can you recall like a defining moment when you felt like you were quote unquoted herbalist is there just a moment that you could put that mantle on and say aha I am well I guess this is the uh Facebook moment you know how you post your best stories and you're not posting oh my God I had a flat tire and I got really angry at somebody or um and I love that he picked this up but Mark Blumenthal has told this story at different conferences it's about being a community herbalist and so when I was out of you know PA school and still learning the herbs and making minimum wage Farm I had a hustle I had I had a headaches rent no running water living how we live right like it was it was magnificent it was beautiful and we and we didn't you know we didn't have to come up with bills because we didn't want to be doing that so it was the days in Virginia when massage was not licensed so I got you might know this book George Downey it was these hand-drawn diagrams of how to learn massage so I taught myself massage I got a lot of my friends I bought a used table and I would go to wealthy Virginia horse country and make a lot of money massaging wealthy horses and then go back I would do that in the morning and then I'd go back and I'd wander the woods and I'd learn the herbs and I'd study the herbs so I did that and and then during that time I would be working with people but I would never charge because I had no training um and then when in seven years literally in seven years rappahannocks Berryville Virginia Little Washington those folks my community started referring to me as a herbalist and that's when I realized I'm literally a community created herbalist because that's how they see me and that's how they're coming to me um and I kept massaging for a while but really was the plans and so you know that's kind of the conundrum of so many herbalists it's like yeah you don't quit your day job but you also have to really you know there's a moment when you step in and you really say all right and it isn't new age when I say they will be there when you are in service they will be there and you know I don't believe it's all good I believe it all is and that business is that Buddhist yes we're here and there are many things today that aren't good but it all is and there's such a generosity the generosity and beneficiency if that's even a word of nature extends so beyond our limited Realms which is why I so love the dream world I so love that ritual place because I could never have dreamed like the life I live now sitting here talking to you and being the Elder and you know I wouldn't have dreamed that the place when you step across that line and you say I'm in service and bunner talks a lot about it and show up it's showing up for them and something shifts and it's this deep deep connection and that's that connection and your success and your comfort may look different than what your culture and when we're talking today about colonization and decolonizing our mind I think that's one place with herbalism like be colonizing what does our success look like what does my car look like I mean we all had beat up Subarus and we didn't if we even had a car um but and here we are I've got a great coffee so yeah that's so basically what you're sharing which I love is it's it's really what our community says we're herbalist you know it's the same with when we're really ready to practice is when your community or your family or others are asking you know and then you and then you trust the plants you step up and say I am it's not really yeah right yeah that's so beautiful yeah and um you know and now we have clinical training programs and you know and and I I always liken it too or um dear Terence McKenna you know he's saying if you're holding the ecstatic dose five grams um if you're holding the ecstatic dose in your hand about the journey and you're not terrified then you're not in the right space that's so beautiful and he's really expressing the Deep reverence and where you're about to go and so I say that to my third year graduates on the day of graduation if you're not terrified then you're not in the right space right because now you're about to step into people's intimate spaces and you're about to become part of people's lives and really you know the the power of these plants and um the safety the the the lies in them and and the ways that they change you know they may drink one cup of tea and never go back but something shifted for them so yeah it's about it's very different it's so much about trust you know and it's about trusting the planets because we're really in service to them you've said that in so many incredible ways cat is there I know you've studied with so many people you know and also from very different backgrounds and traditions that just at this moment is there like one herbal teacher that you would credit who had a great influence on your work yeah I I would have to say my last herbal teacher um uh Karen Sanders um and Sarah Holmes uh out of blue Otter herb school and you know it's again you know I've had incredible magnificent teachers all along the way and having on the altar constantly you know it's it's never finishing and that can be a frustration to herbal students like oh the more I learn the more I don't know and that's such a sign of health and life and and so I think Karen and Sarah's teaching Karen's Choctaw and uh as she said I I teach like an Indian and uh I you know there's still parts of my um being my control my way of hierarchical thinking that not only the content of her teachings but the method and how she delivered her teachings had to really pull apart and it was a disintegration and you know that's the whole idea of the Ancients and you know it's the disintegration of the ego but what I found with Karen and Sarah was they're very teaching had me I had to rearrange I had to rearrange certain truths that I held and how she brought the plants in and you know I can't teach that way because you know that's what she asks you know that's her teaching and so I can tell stories about it and I can use plants you know in that way but and and she um she met me like I really wanted somebody to push back and Karen is Sarah is you know a mighty force in a very different way so I loved that um the energy Karen has had um so Karen has had a I would call her a teacher's teacher you know she's had a major influence on American herbalists these days you know and everyone who has taken her Apprentice programs um have just talked about really the same in the same respectful way that you are as her ability to you know guide them down their own path you know and to kind of like you said push back she's a mountain she is such a force and even when she would come to the terrible conferences you know and she'd be doing these workshops it might be two or four hours they would be life-changing for people yeah she I also have will be interviewing her as well for this series because I have like everyone I have such incredible respect for her she's a force and she's so unusual right she's just yeah oh and she's hysterical I mean wait I'm not gonna tell her story because that is so where you're going to have her story is pretty mind-blowing um and you know when she wraps you in her bosom there is like no other mother on the planet and you know I was with other practitioners in this very very special apprenticeship so we traveled in it in a different way and you know doing these plant Journeys with her at the foot of Mount Shasta Uh I that was the dream that dream dreamed in I didn't even hear of her and I was invited to be part of this uh by Deb Sewell um and that's that dream that's that uh golden thread and you know I love that golden thread um it's so important and can I I printed out the poem can I read that I printed it out especially you know just thinking again of the younger herbalists and going forward and and this is that magic but this is by William Stafford and um there's a thread you follow it goes among things that change but it doesn't change people wonder about what are you pursuing you have to explain about the thread but it is hard for others to see while you hold on to it you cannot get lost tragedies happen people get hurt or die you suffer get old nothing you can do can stop times unfolding you don't ever let go of the threat and so there's times where I think where is the thread and then this invitation will come into place and so I just love that we can call it Spirit we can call it God Jesus you know we all have our lenses of that power of our lives but that golden thread um was introduced to me by Stephen by being there yeah so I just love Yeah another powerful teacher for us on this planet right he's uh he was actually the inspiration for the inner voices because when he passed away for this series that we're doing the inner voices of the elders when he passed away I just thought you know we told so many stories and I do have lots and lots of the stories recorded but I just felt like oh this is happening way too soon right and it always happens with this generation you know it's our time to move on and new you know as we're aging and we'll see it more and more and then the new generation comes so yeah just the importance of capturing so Kat I know that you've worked in you know with herbs for so many years and that you have I've heard you tell really literally probably hundreds of stories about how the herbs have served in healing waves and you've done that also in this just already in our storytelling but is there a particular story that you want to share with our listeners and when you saw the plants work a miracle you know or just some healing story of on any level it can be in the dream world or on a physical level you know sometimes I I often say I'll go to my grave in awe of these plants and uh like I still never I'll have clients respond or students and I'm still like really you know motherboard did that you know I still have this incredulity um and so I think that the latest um I I had the great great honor of traveling to South Africa and I say that as a great honor my sister worked works for an NGO that works in food sovereignty and working with uh childhood nutrition and so that was really the impetus of us going that enabled us um to travel um to South Africa and um what's what's funny is um I had met this young herbalist at the Florida herbal conference a number of years ago and he lived in South Africa so I got in touch with him and I said oh I'm going you know where should I go what do you recommend and so we started this great communication and so while I was there he messaged me and he said you know I would love it if you would be able to bring um this sacred white root home you could save me amazing shipping so it's this whole long story you know I was traveling with family and a friend and um and it was kind of a hassle and it turned out to be really really heavy and we traveled with only two um carry-on bags like we did not have extra luggage but it was the plant and the the plant was all about dream time and I was traveling with somebody who was having these horrific nightmares just working through certain things and I was and it's also a route that works with neuro degenerative diseases and I was traveling with somebody with Parkinson's and so it was just this amazing piece of there we were in Africa and because of it we went into these incredible herb shops and you know we didn't have a whole lot of time but just having this powder having this presence having this root that's that relationship you know how does that happen and so they none of them ingested it I did you know because it's unknown and I had to look it up and as it's like a dog and you know I didn't know it so but I I don't know if that's that Miracle story but the miracle is you know when you're interfacing and it's all about those connections and it's about helping in men it was very very powdery and it got you know just the funny stories of traveling with us and it took me to many places by asking local people about this route and their story of the root and how they used it and you know they were like how do you know about that rude and um and then they would open up and so it was this um portal it was a familiar portal uh as it really enabled me to relate uh to local people in a way that I could I see the miracle in that story cat quite clearly you know uh because you're following the golden thread you know with that plant here here you're given a plant and it actually is indicated for two major issues that are P that people you're traveling with and you're with a very small group right you wasn't like you were with a lot of people and then also how that plant you into the local communities and took you on your own dream path yeah it's remarkable how the plants do that but I think in part so I think that's going on around us in this world all the time and that it's not really specific to herb people at all just simply that we open up and are more aware like it's like we've said yes to that kind of input right and we're aware of that thread that we're holding I think that's the miracle right there you are the miracle thank you thank you and you know it's so funny we always did we choose herbalism who chose who you know orbitals are pretty audacious brilliant I mean going to Herb conferences we are surrounded by science I know and multi-talented people right like I think about a person like Michael Moore or Michael Tierra they're brilliant musicians you know like concert pianists and and then they're marvelous mathematicians and incredible scientists and herbalists you know and they weave it all together and to this amazing yeah amazing what Mata for the soul a feast right yeah so I think the plants are choosing well and they're choosing more and more and more people because you know we we go to social media and I there's just so many incredible posts and making tea and the plants um you know the word is out and what I loved what bunner was saying is this is that guy in impulse you know this is not because it's popular this isn't because it's hip it is because here we are at this very very vital transition time and this is the way our mother's really taking care of us the word is spreading and of course there's always the you know notion of conservation but you know the plantains the chickweeds there is such an abundance of these medicines and so you know this is her response and using all of these Dynamic voices I mean I've just been working with our friends at ecoversity and envision and you know watching you know that whole shining the light and and really that energy that Consciousness that radiation of kind of transcendence um and working with a plan so um yeah it's funny it's like when I'm thinking about the plants choosing I I remember especially going to the New England women's and I'd be waiting in an airport and it'd be like oh I know which women are going to that conference because you know we we whether it's the skirts or just this air just this energy um and and we come in we were colorful oh they were like a colorful diverse you know Floral Garden it was really I I know that what you're saying they were just an energy you know you were talking about this wave of young herbalist new herbalists coming in and it makes me think you know I know when we were all starting our work there were certain challenges that we had to face um and maybe you could address that also but I'm also curious what you're seeing as the current challenges that are the young younger generation or the present generation is facing now in their herbal work it's a broad question so you can answer that any way you like but I just like your insights and what you're seeing yeah yeah but I think I spoke to you know some of my issues you know you know fitting in integrating science and herbalism and you know kind of the long lonely years of you know that isolating practice or um but that in many ways was such a powerful gift because I had to go to the plants you know I spent all those hours in the woods you know with friends I mean it was hippie carpenters and musicians and we were living the life we we were wealthy beyond means because we had our freedom and you know we were able to live a lot more simply um so because I didn't have so many online programs or different tools available we really began with the plants and you know I began my practice with 12 plants and I was a radical bio regionalist and I had to know him I had a harvest them I made them I knew them and I stayed that way for a number of years um so I think for today again I'm very excited by all of this medicine coming forward and really touching people that from all walks of life and and really getting in between the spaces you know because in between the spaces is really where that ground Matrix that substance that's where it's all laid down and that's what nourishes the cells and that's why the herbs are are so subtle yet so powerful so I think for a younger or I can speak to my students and my graduates um you know why I think we had so much more freedom is there weren't these societal standards of what success looked like or possessions or mortgage or uh you know owning a house till later and so I'm kind of saddened that you know early on there's just this whole inculcation of you know you have to have this or it has to look like this and you know honestly I didn't have health insurance right yeah I know I had it you know when I got pregnant and my Elder Mother home birth in a you know under you know anyway it was an ecstatic birth but it was like oh maybe I should get insurance but you know we we were not um about you know and so there's this whole fear and I can't tell people well you don't need insurance it's not my place but they're coming into a world where these young healthy people I I need to do this to get health insurance and so you know that's different you know we did have those freedoms so you know the the hard part of disentangling and and really saying what do I need and and what is authentic and what is my golden thread because I think the world is louder you know social media is bringing in so many more images so many more expectations or you know I don't look like that or I don't have that presence or that Tick Tock just went viral you know it's you know it's this whole swiping kind of Vata you know affecting our nervous system so so you know it's you know everybody has to make that decision and they have families uh and it's like courage it's that courage kind of to be poor if you will um but but our poverty was so deeply nourishing and I hope that I'm expressing that in you know looking at poverty and not at all saying I had poverty at that time I'm being very very mindful you know of my color of my privilege but I didn't have a car you know I didn't have any water and I didn't have a trust fund and I didn't have insurance and uh we went and got our own food and this was a year it was clearly a choice you know I want to say that it was it was a choice because any one of us if we wanted could have gone and gotten quote unquote the regular jobs but we were trusting of this other energetics that was happening and running through us and there was also for us at that time like right now the movement that we're seeing is the movement of the internet and like you say so much commercialization of herbalism our movement at that time of the 70s and the 80s was back to the land you know driven by people like Helen and Scott nearing and Juliet de Berkeley Levy so our our teachers and our Guides of this other generation were those people who were breaking from the system I think that's kind of what you're sharing you know we we chose to live really we did choose to live these very simple lives because they would take us back to what we craved and yearned for the most which was this relationship with nature and the Earth so right thank you so much and thank you for you know rebalancing when I use that word poverty that wasn't the right word it was that simple it was choosing that and thank you so much for um you know bringing that in and the whole focus on materialism you know always been there but not as it is today it's profound so you know my heart is with you know younger generations and all that they you know were born into you know 20 years ago they walked right into uh this time and it's how do you process that and how do you deal with that and I am blown away I am so in awe I feel so tended I feel that we're gonna be okay when I watch their teachings and their depth and how they're taking you know the Alchemy and the distillation and the astrology and um you know they're taking our foundational teachings and foundational native and foundational um African I mean there were amazing um black herbalists around here um that I learned from and had certain they passed early but um so there's all kinds of Foundations and yet I'm just in awe of the creativity and courage in other ways that I'm watching um 20 30 you know 40 year old herbalists just really taking and going further um and bringing in other assets agree so fully with you it's it's very exciting to see you know but it's also I think also important to look at what were the challenges then and what they are now you know because they are very different you know we we created a foundation and they're soaring on that and creating a foundation that really the next generation of plant lovers and Earth Advocates will stand on as well it's fun to see that you know to know that they're just building blocks that will continue and so that's why it's so important that we really look at the blocks that we're putting down you know it's important to look at the foundation that each generation is building to pass on I don't think we oftentimes pause to think about it in that way but it is kind of it is kind of exciting to see well our time we're coming close that I did what I had a couple other things I I wanted to ask you so you've talked about a number of herbs that I just was wondering um what plants you would consider like your allies plants that have always just showed up for you you know that are I know you mentioned chickweed earlier and are there other plants that you just consider your plant allies that you just could lean on and know they're gonna be there for you yeah I do want to go back to one thing about those blocks in the foundation because Rosemary United plant savers is one of those um absolute foundational building blocks that you and others you know others but your vision because there is rarely a younger herbal as I see on social media that is not addressing that issue so that now has become a language just as the lens of allopathy there is now the lens of ecology conservation and that's so much in part um of the magnificence of you know you're a foundation and Sarah Katz and Linda and Susan Leopold and all these great leaders all the board folks and Paul's trials and but that has become a very fluent language um and so I just had to go back and really talk about those blocks so motherboard mother really oh website to love about mother Ward um I I can find there's just so many uh places that mother Ward comes up in my practice um and I don't know if you want me to go in did I usually a little bit about motherboard because it is a she's a powerful being yeah please do so I love drop doses I think drop doses can be physiologic I don't ever use um maybe sometimes in an acute crisis I might use up to a half a teaspoon but um it's a vasodilator it's a real she's a relaxant and she really does embody like if you were to imagine being held by your mother physiologically what would happen to you and so there would be this dropping you would drop into your sense of self you would drop into your heart space and you would have this movement because Comfort isn't just sedation Comfort is moving and it moves the blood and it helps communication better because you're safer and when you feel safe you're going to communicate and you're going to regulate and you know safety is such an important part of healing and so I feel mother Ward is a vasodilator as a bidder it's very cooling for all Cycles I remember referring to teachers Susan weed was a major teacher yeah 30 years ago and for years for PMS I went on her formula and her formula is 10 drops starting at ovulation and once you stop start bleeding you stop the mother word because motherboard can increase bleeding and it will 10 drops from ovulation to beginning of bleeding do that for three months and I have seen Cycles really change over really get into a much greater space and peace and comfort and then I learned more herbs and got really complicated and now I'm kind of returning like my Apothecary is getting smaller and I'm saying okay bioregional time's up we got to do it it's now um so anyway motherboard um comes for for many different reasons and especially for anxiety and I will say I working with younger people I really see a lot of nervous system disorders um because of the world because of and so I think mother Ward is very very important there um you know I'm a huge fan of Burdock I do not think Burdock is all that bitter like it's not one of my go-to bitters I think it's very sweet I think it's nervous and building and and you know the whole doctrine of signatures you know I I say you don't get a certificate from me if you haven't done a complete down as a tech Burdock because you need a camping bar and you know you're there you're there for hours and it's patience and you know it dips deep into the Earth and I use it for chronic conditions because the chronicity buries things and you put layers in layers and when I'm working with long-time diabetes or whatever you know I love that Burdock it's super gentle it's super sweet but over a period of time it'll go deep and it'll reach deep into that place where ah okay here we are this is where we really want to work from uh so I love Burdock of course dandelion um all different forms in fact I'm drinking my tea um is it's springtime time right spring is coming and not up there but it's coming around here and so I have my roof blend I'm getting my liver I'm kind of living you know in that root time now I'm drinking the roots and then some of the mushrooms I put in there I'm just kind of stirring and of course dandelion is a major part of that um scootal area I mean small cap it's so me I mean I I think if I were to have one herb that I've taken pretty consistently uh it it's gold cap and I've had some knock-down interesting conversations uh with herbalists and I love dried skull cap you know anisee dried skull cap is compost um but I think dried skull cap tea should be in our water system I just think it's beautiful all those horse people that I worked with um you know they would fall and they'd have injuries but they'd have to do the dressage and get back on the horse and I found scootal area amazing for pain but staying present and so everybody's different of course sometimes skull cap you know will will put you to sleep but for me it's that um it's such a great pain remin um and yet by kind of slowing down that roof brain challenge some of the performers or yeah they had focus and so the medicines in the dose um but for me I run hot I'm chatty I you know love sinking so scootal area is really wonderful and we've grown now by call so now I can use bicol skull cap which I've been waiting to because you know so many people have been singing or Praises but now that we're growing it I feel able to use by call and to clear heat and covid I used by call a lot for um covet time that's an incredible list of herbs sweetie those are nothing Maybe and here's a great little plantain story um so the Midwife that I learned herbalism from um she um her son uh had stepped on a sewing needle like a long sewing needle from for a machine and it was the only time he went to a doctor he was like 11 went and got his leg x-rayed and it was way up there so um they said well we're probably gonna have to go in surgery and she said okay give me two weeks so we used homeopathic uh what is it um uh soft sulfur it's the remedy that expels unwanted objects from your body because your body wants to get rid of stuff right silica it was homeopathics which you know and plantain soaks three times a day and slippery on poultices and I'm telling you I believe this is truth story so not coming out not coming out and of course she's a Midwest she had this enamel wash basin and so we had this breakfast big breakfast we're on our way back to the doctor he lifts his foot and we hear that ping um and it could have been gravity we couldn't walk on it um you know it could have just been time I know that Plantation gently gently crawling that out and a year later that same young boy on the same foot got bit by a copperhead did not go to the hospital Echinacea and planting um and you know and then a year later his skin shed so that boy's a medicine boy um but anyway lots of uses for plants you know cat I love that you of your plant allies except for the bical Gap are all those really common herbs that we find in our backyards everywhere across the temperate regions of the world you know that those allies and for most of us that's the truth you know there are these plants that just are there waving at us constantly yeah I love all of those plants too every time you talked about what I could feel my heart pounding but we're sort of coming near the end I just had a couple things more I wanted to ask you you know one is there's so much that you've done and we've only just barely touched on it in this interview so much that you shared with the world and gifted the world with but when you look at what you know your life with the plants uh and as an herbalist what are you most proud of that you've done is there anything that just jumps out at you that you just feel the best about oh I'm gonna start crying um because I I just went into my heart and and I think it's showing up for them you know really falling so so deeply in love with them that we've committed our days Our lives our beliefs um it you know it is the graduates it is all the schools and practices and beautiful apothecaries in Charlottesville from my graduates it's all of that when you ask that question and I dropped into my heart and that Hawk is now sitting in a flowering Camellia he's still there with us uh oh I mean I didn't want to be obnoxious and keep talking about this stunning Hawk it has been right there but he just moved to a flower um I I think being given the honor and the privilege and the space um to just fully Embrace and you know drop deeper and deeper and deeper in love with the plants which then acknowledges myself and all of those that I come in contact with in the credible privilege of meeting so many people I would never meet um through these magnificent beings so for me I I have to say it's the love I feel and I never would have thought about that so um thank you thank you for that question just always such a reflective question yeah I hear that very deeply and I and I feel it in my heart when you're speaking you know and I also when I look at what I think of one of your Great accomplishments I can like pull out lots of different threads I mean there's so many things but I think one of the things is this incredible offering of your new book that you wrote energetic herbalism it's just such a magnificent book and the way that it ties the different Traditions together it makes them so accessible and understandable and also allows us to see how all of these great systems that evolved are all very similar you know they they have their differences but they really are about understanding the energetics of the plants in each culture kind of develops their own way of communicating that and you tied that all together it's such a great book and I'm just so grateful I know you worked on it for almost two or three years right it was a really big task for you you weren't available very much I know every time I email you I'm on a writing Retreat you'd be writing away but it and I had the great honor thank you so much of allowing me and asking me to write the forward for it so that book has become massively popular you know I know that it's a you know really reference textbooks already for people so yeah so our I just want let people know about that book do you want to say a few words about that process of writing it or what yeah um well it was an honor for me you should I mean it was your light Rosemary that really it and that knee-haw commute funky little Community Center so of course you know going back to origin and um really you know honoring the book with having your writing there um you know it's my three-year curriculum and I knew at one point I would stop you know teaching so essentially you know the book is what I teach in three years um all in one version um and the interesting part of the process is of course I've been working on it for years writing curriculum but when the contract came in from Chelsea Green I had seven months so that was you know really a very intense process but fortunately it was during um well I I it was it was during pandemic so I was blessed with the seclusion of that but I I want to say what's magnificent to me is what the reflection of people they they like the content but it's the stories like more than anything people come back with gratitude for the stories and that's what I really want to you know maintain going forward it's got to always be in the storytelling form and um and that's that that clinical experience we have the stories this isn't an intellectual we have as a clients and and I was thinking about you the other day because I did get this email from this woman kind of writing to say your plan like we're a big institution and had a question about the book and she was from New Zealand and she said we have a book club and we're gonna we decided we're gonna spend a whole other year on the book well I immediately email her and say oh my God I will never be famous enough not to get so ecstatic and I we set up a zoom I'm like I totally want to show up in your book club but the excitement of the stories and where it's showing up I mean I'm in awe religion and started Printing and it's really getting out there um but it's not sacred it's the sacred that is woven in to all of the different traditions and so you know really making the energetics very intuitive very simple I remember learning Chinese medicine thinking I could never begin to study this or teach this I was about to go to China and then this piece of land said we need you and I ended up buying property in Rappahannock I was on my way taking that money to go to China I was like so you know oh I've got to do so anyway so then I finally realized no these are gems these are pearls we can distill and we can make this available because Chinese teachers and elevated teachers very freely brought it here the sunlad brought it here and wanted to share it and so these were Traditions I felt very comfortable it was taught by me and it was said teach this but um so yeah it was it was a beautiful hard process um and just I'm very excited that people really love the stories and um there's a lot in it so it's definitely not a cover to cover read um but it's been fun it's neat how when a book is done it goes out in the world like you know like you give birth to it you work really hard on it and then it goes out into the world like an adult you know it has its own life and then you find out it's being read by people in all different worlds and as years go by you know it'll stop in and you'll see it somewhere at a bookstore or somebody will mention it again but I really see it like an adult child that's gone into the world and the other thing that you just stated that I I did want to mention is I just love how herbalists always throughout history have shared Traditions you know it's like traditions have traveled and they're living anything that becomes stagnant of course dies so these Traditions are always living and changing and moving and yes they are based on Ancient principles but herbal is have always shared those you know like what we're creating here is a western herbal tradition is is like also will be always changing and share being shared with the rest of the world it already is being shared you know people are adapting the ways that American herbalists are doing something so it's something that I've Loved about herbalism how the plants themselves move from culture to culture you know they they move and really literally move you know they find ways to travel and move around and the teachings do too it's mostly by the elders you know who pass those teachings on because they're they're important Living Traditions so yeah I just want to thank you we've come to the end of our time but I just want to thank you so much Kat I love you so much you know and it's always such a pleasure to spend time with you and it's also wonderful to invite all of these people to be listening in and to share you know just the magnificence of who you are and your wonderful stories and your gifts to the world so yeah so um people can find you at your website do you want to share where they can um tune in for that and where they can get sure um yeah it's a
