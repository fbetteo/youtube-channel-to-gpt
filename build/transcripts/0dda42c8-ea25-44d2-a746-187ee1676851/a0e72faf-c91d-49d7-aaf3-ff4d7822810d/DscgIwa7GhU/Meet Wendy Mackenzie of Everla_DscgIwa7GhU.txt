hi I'm Wendy I'm the CEO of everlasting Herb Farm here in peachum and I'm a big Rosary glad star fan I don't know too many people who aren't we're in peachum Vermont at Everlasting Herb Farm Home of meadow be deodorant and I want to tell you a little bit about my herbal Journey The herbal path that I've been [Music] on I grew up in Vermont and my mom had beautiful flower Gard and we had vegetable gardens and at that time as a teenager I wasn't interested in Plants I became a Peace Corp volunteer in the Dominican Republic early 20s not interested in Plants but when I became a new mom and I had my first house I thought I really wanted to smell really great so at the time I was teaching high school health down in southern Vermont and I had the good sense and Fortune to have a whole bunch of guest speakers come into my classroom and one of them was named named Isabelle Hadley and she changed my life because she passed around large jars of colorful dried herbs and little vs of essential oil and I was cooked after I learned with Isabelle Hadley and learned about herbs from her we moved to Northern Vermont to this Farmhouse where we lived 26 years and as luck would have it we were 30 minutes door too to Sage Mountain where the famous Rosemary glad star lived and taught at the beginning of my journey of becoming an herbalist I became an intern at Zack Woods Herb Farm not too far away from me with Jeff and Mel Carpenter after I was an intern with Jeff and Mel I began an herbal correspondence course with rosemary gladstar and it was a really exciting day when I went to Sage Mountain to pick up my correspondence course in person but I absolutely loved the course because I could go at my own pace my kids were little I could study when I had time and I found out quickly that I really enjoyed making savs because you could take oils which are kind of messy Infuse herbs including weeds and then add a little bit of beeswax or another wax and make them solid and easy to apply to the Skin So In addition to taking the course being only 30 minutes door to door to Sage Mountain I eventually began taking courses at Sage mountain and I know this is all about the herbal correspondence course but I just wanted to mention that I was really fortunate to be able to go to Sage mountain and learn so many things from so many herbal teachers and just really was able to further my study I believe that you can do that online now through Rosemary's class because she has so many teachers that she's worked with and I believe her correspondence course covers them as well I was also an intern for Rosemary and I quickly found out that I really don't like weeding I'm not much of a gardener I don't like being out when it's too hot when it's too windy when it's too wet um I'm a little bit picky that way but if you saw my Gardens today you would understand that they're kind of jungle likee everything gets to live I love to plant things and just see how they flourish on their own or not and I just kind of find the whole science experiment of it all very fun I started Everlasting Herb Farm back in 2003 and it was kind of a side hustle again my kids were little it was just something to get my brain into and it was just really fun for me to do and then I went back to teaching full-time because I'm a teacher and that's what I've done most of my life but a friend of mine suggested that I send send some of my products to a large Vermont retailer because we were looking at cataloges and she said you know they make a lot of things like what you make but they don't sell exactly what you make you should send them some of your products and I looked at her and I remember smiling and shaking my head and saying yep that's a great idea so I took every product I made put them in a box addressed it to no one in particular and sent it off and 4 days later I was speaking to no one in particular and I've worked with them for 12 years since white labeling and making products for them working for this large Vermont retailer overtook our entire house the mudroom became a warehouse of boxes the office was now a whole store room of ingredients and our dining room wasn't for eating anymore it was for making products eventually my husband and business partner Matthew built a barn in the backyard to fit into the neighborhood it just looks beautiful he took the downstairs I got the upstairs so we moved Everlasting Herb Farm out into the backyard at the beginning of the pandemic I was was asked by a local woman to help her because she couldn't apply deodorant to one side of her body because she had had a stroke and she asked me to make her a cream deodorant and at the time I had been wearing natural deodorant and I had no idea they could actually work because most natural natural deodorants don't work and I had never heard of a cream deodorant but my Achilles heel is that I wanted to help her so I thought what have I got to lose I can help her I could try around about the same time when the pandemic started I got some funding some technical grant money from ncic over in Northern New Hampshire and they helped fund a three-year course that I took through formula Banica in London and they're an online cosmetic formulating um School everything's organic and I learned a lot through formula Botanica so what I did is combined what I was learning from them with what I had already learned from rosemary I learned about a whole bunch of new plant-based ingredients plus new methods that I had never heard of before and one of them was a cold Blended cream and you could take an oil and you could take some Butters and you could mix them together and you could get a cream like substance and I did that and then in Vermont we had a couple of days where it was abnormally hot it's not normally that hot in Vermont but when I went back to check on my samples that I was testing the jar had deflated so I had half the amount in the jar that I started with and it was not a good thing but I looked really hard at that jar and I thought okay I know what I can do to you and I actually remember talking to the jar and I thought okay I'm going back to my roots my sage Mountain Roots My Rosemary gladstar roots and I used some techniques I had learned from rosemary to work with this new product and it basically took 2 years of trial and error testing it on family and friends testing it by the wood stove so it wouldn't melt but I perfected the format for this new cream deodorant and also a solid bar deodorant and that was the beginning of meow deodorant it took 2 years to perfect Meadow be but in 2023 we won a couple of international Awards in the 20123 beauty shortless competition and most recently in 2024 our business won one of the nine awards given out by the SBA here in Vermont and we're the only business in the Northeast Kingdom and we received the 2024 micro Enterprise of the year I get to do what I love every single day I have a 25-step commute to the backyard which is way better than the 45-minute commute one way to school and I get to make products that make me so happy and soothe people's skin and I have a strong customer following so I'm really proud of that Rosemary's course her Art and Science of herbalism put me on this path and I'm really thankful for Rosemary the plants and the magical fairies in my garden I've been on a wonderful herbal path and I can't wait to hear about your herbal paths and it will probably start with rosemary glad Stars Art and Science of herbalism [Music]
