how you store your herbs is pretty critical to how they stay how long they stay fresh and the big things that really deplete the energy of herbs are light like bright sunlight even filtered light sometimes can really start to fade those herbs heat if you store your herbs in a hot room like above the kitchen in the kitchen above the kitchen shelf which is where so many cooks store their precious culinaries that heat is going to just you know pretty much dissipate those essential oils which are very volatile the volatile oils so you want to have cool out of direct sunlight and not a lot of air circulation in the jar you know you don't want to have just a tiny bit of herb in the bottom of a big jar because excess air can also draw the properties out of the plants so you want to think about a cool place around 50 to 60 degrees is really ideal it doesn't have to be dark something where there's not a lot of light streaming in at least directly on the herbs and that will just help to keep those herbs really better for you in a longer period of time
