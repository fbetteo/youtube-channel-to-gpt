hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant in healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do [Music] feel I know that I'm part of when I I am thankful to be [Music] here I am thankful my welcome guest today is one of my oldest dearest friends and fellow Urban adventurers Janie Boswell Jane is a beloved and highly respected Community herbalist who has trained and inspired Generations of herbal students she is the founder of the Dandy liion herbal Center in Northern California where she offered comprehensive

medicine herbal consultations and herbal education to everyone in her community who was interested who had a need to connect with the plants as she has so often said connecting to our plant allies connects us to our roots and helps us heal amen thank you so much Jane for being with me today I'm so excited about our conversation oh I'm really excited too and a little nervous but that'll go away once we get started what have you ever been nervous to talk to me this is just a wonderful chat we'll have and we're talking about our favorite thing herbs so it's going to be great I thought we met you I thought we'd start because we met at herb school so many years ago actually I don't even remember I think it was over 35 maybe even 40 years ago we shared So Many Adventures there let's start there um I was going to ask you know if you remember when you first drove up when you first arrived at her school and your first impression there not of me but of the school oh of course I remember it was one of the most momentous moments of my life so I'd been living up in the mountains in um Utah and really enjoying the outdoors and being inspired and I um took Dominion nbal College's correspondence course while I was there and then I I got to a certain point in the course and I said to myself I need a live teacher I really want to interact with somebody not just a book and so I found the California school of herbal studies which was one of the few schools at that time as you know in the whole country where you could go study so I applied to the program and you know got accepted and um then I packed up my van with all my personal belongings at the time and my dog and I drove from Utah to Emerald Valley and I just remember so well pulling down that beautiful driveway through that was incredible trees and plants and having this vision of this old schoolhouse and these gorgeous Gardens and I mean it was magical and it's still magical and it really still looks very much the same as it did when I came there in the late 70s and the only issue was when my dog got out of the van it was oh no we don't want to accept dogs here I'm like oh problem because I was going to be living there at the school cuz you know you took a few people there in Residence and then you said to me well you need to talk to the gardener about this so my dog was extremely well behaved and she won everybody over including Tim Blakeley The Gardener and he said okay you can stay and the dog can stay and I remember you were driving down the hill from your beautiful nol oh I lost a headphone um from your um yur up on the hill and then you popped out of your car and all your Radiance and beauty and your flowering your hair and your joyfulness and I thought I've landed I see you know the reason with what happened with your beautiful dog Jennifer who we all loved is we could never say no to you it would have been impossible it so I remember that it's like you were the only person ever that we ever said yes you could have your dog there because there a you you know your energy was so amazing I remember that thank you oh yeah so you've been running your own herb School The Dandy Lang herbal Center in Northern California for I think over three decades now and uh it has an incredible reputation I've been I I've had the honor thank you of teaching there several times but you know what inspired you to open the herb schull and what was the experience like for you running that for so long well as you probably remember when I was down at the California school with you there came to be a point where you said to me Jane I want to teach new classes and I want you to teach the ones I'm already teaching and I'm adding this because it's a good story and I said to you oh you're kidding you know you want me to start teaching those classes and and you said well you've sat for 3 years is in the same classes over and over so I know you have the depth of information that it takes and really all you need to know is more than the people that come which I tell my students all the time when they're when they're venturing out and teaching their own classes and I was like okay and to be humble of what you don't know and so I started teaching at the California school and then when we moved up to hul County because I wanted to be a little bit more Rural and not have to drive through Sacramento to get to the mountains so we're close to a lot of mountains here I thought well I want to keep teaching and I love teaching and I love teaching herbalism and so I'll start a school yes you did yeah yeah just wonderful yeah so you know for all of those people people who might be interested in starting their own herb schools do you have I know it's a huge topic so asking a simple question like this really simplifies it but just would you have like any advice for them like just a two or three things you might like want to share with them about running their own School sure so when you referred earlier to me as a community herbalist it made me I always think you know what does that really mean and I think one of the things that it's meant for me is teaching my classes because in my community now there's so many people who could all be teaching those classes because they've come and they've learned at dandelion herbal Center so I would say for people wanting to open their own school start teaching a few classes and see what kind of reception you get in your community and see how you like it see if it like Sparks you and brings you alive and if it does then teach a few more classes and then go to creating a school and and you mentioned earlier Rosemary about coming here to teach and I think you came every year more than a few times because I was such an honor for my students to be able to learn from you and for us to be able to have a visit of course was our secondary Mo motive so in um your own teaching of an B school then if your students are interested in opening ones I think a really great program is also bringing visiting teachers oh yeah though I started with teaching my own classes and then thinking I wish these students could study with all these amazing other herbalists and actually my husband Ken said to me why don't you bring them all here and I said okay and so I created the visiting teacher program and then once a month brought an amazing herbalist like yourself and many others so start small with your school and then just do what inspires you because if you're inspired and excited about it it's going to be successful now those are such beautiful wise words you know it's interesting when you shared that I just it took me back that's exactly how I how I started you just did these little classes and then people wanted a little more and so then I started you know then I think I went from teaching my own classes to those events the conferences and then the her school and then it was like yeah it definitely bred more teachers because I only know so much it Al it was also a way of broadening what the teach what I knew I could learn from others but also it gave the um this expanded Vision to the students so yeah it's such beautiful that's a beautiful wise way to do it and there's such receptivity right now you know one thing too I wanted to share that I've always loved about your teachings is you know you teach a lot of wisdom about the plants but it's always connected to the Earth and spirituality you have just woven this beautiful tapestry of information and spiritual contact you know ceremonies and it's yeah it's an experience it's more than just going and learning information it's you know it's really taking people into a deep experience which I learned mostly from you at the beginning and continue to to this day so thank you and yeah I really want to honor you Rosemary for being just an amazing inspiration in my life and in the lives of so many herbalists and the fact that you just don't stop you're continuing now you're doing this program and I know that so many people really appreciate what you're offering and it's an honor to be your friend and to have you as my teacher thank you darling I felt exactly the say about you actually so you know uh it's interesting I I I've been watching these last couple years you know as you're transiting out of your act of work at the school I know you're still there and you still offer you know guidance and stuff but to see that you've passed this you know living Legacy on to your students and um I'm just curious you know I know it's a time of change for all of us but plus has experience been for you watching these Brant students who work with you for years I know they're also good friends but they're taking over this amazing program that you've offered and how is that I mean are you having any retirement Blues yet or I should say maybe retirement greens or is it feeling good or oh it's feeling good and I was so thrilled that they wanted to take this school over because I didn't know if it would continue and um both Allison and Jessica were in the same 10-month herbal studies program I think 20 years ago they were together as students and they've continued to um work with herbalism and taught some classes with me and my program and the fact that they even wanted to do it I was just elated and I have so much respect for who they are and what they have to offer and no question that they have everything that it takes to run the school and as we both know our students come up and they do even a better job yeah they offer new things and and it's been it's been pretty easy to let it go because I was ready and I have real confidence in them and I'm Consulting and the classes are still happening here at my home is also where the school is and I get to see students um when they come up and then I can just chat as I wish and then go out on a walk go play in the garden and so it's it's really been perfect I'm really happy yeah it's beautiful it's nice to see that you know I think one thing that um kind of came up to me when you were sharing is I know how much Jessica and Allison really respect and honor the teachings that you've passed on to them which is why they're such amazing teachers you know also because of them and who they are but also just the way that they honor their teachers and I I know for me like it's been easy to pass things on in part I don't like to admit this often but it's in part because I'm given recognition you know so so I can step aside still feeling honored you know and I and I think that I also want to say I think we did that incredibly well for our elders those people that we learn from because we have so much respect and honor for them maybe it's just something that people in the AAL Community do but I know for me it's helped make it easier when I pass along if I'm just completely forgotten it's kind of like oops but you know and and I don't like to admit that ego egotistically you know but it's true I I just and I see your students really doing that I see Allison and Jessica really honoring you for everything that you've shared with them and the opportunities you provided so it helps doesn't it yeah it does help and I think it's something that we need to continue to teach younger herbalists because I don't think it is always remembered to really honor your teachers honor like if you move to a certain area who's already there who's teaching you need to reach out and connect with people and honor them for their work and it's great networking and I think too Rosemary because I'm sure you did this when I've passed on my school I also gave them all my material all my handouts and all my slideshows and I mean that I had worked on and refined over years and years and it felt really good to be able to do that because I wanted it to continue and also because they do honor me and all the other teachers they've had for this information and the information as we know it's not our information yeah it's the people's information I mean we've organized it and put it together in a certain way and spend all this time on our handouts and correspondence courses but the information is the people's information I love you Jane you know I I I think I don't know I think maybe you've heard me say this before maybe not but I know like years ago when I was in the middle of my incredibly busy world you know and was creating all these different things and there were so many times people would come up and say oh you know you're you're really my role model and I would look at him say oh no no you don't I I should not be your role model I completely really I would always point to you honestly my good friend j o now she's my role model because even in the middle of serving and caring for your community you know making yourself available as a Healer and as a teacher and as a friend to so many people you still were able to like find time and make time for yourself you had really much better boundaries than I did you know you'd spent time with your family I would call you sometimes to chat and you'd be out walking with your friends or going camping and I just admired that so much in you and I thought it was I really was not joking when I would say that I thought it was a much better role model really you know of looking for how to be of service and also how to care for yourself and those closest to you and you've always really been the epitome you know the essence I would say of community of a community herbalist to me because you you made medicine for your community you were there as a Healer uh providing healing guidance and then education for everyone interested and you share what a little bit I think you talked about this a moment ago but would you share a little bit more about that Community herbalist model and how you kind of Incorporated that into your life sure and I'm and I'm still in my retirement making medicine and supplying the herb stores with a few medicines and I still have a few clients but just ones I've had for a long time I'm not taking anymore and making medicine for them and then people will you know come to you and and ask you and at this point for me being retired if it's something fun that I'm already making you know and that I have you know you know pass that on to people but um as a young inspiring herbalist it's a great service to you know create Wellness packages for people you know they're they'll come to you they'll ask you you know it's like what you know what do you have what can I do and and you look in your Apothecary and you have a great time putting things together and supplying those and also as a community herbalist you might want to volunteer and give a talk for Sierra Club or the native plet Society or the senior centers or the garden clubs and it's a good way to integrate into your community and it's an exciting way for you to share I remember one time going to a Garden Club and talking to them all about the weeds that they could put in their salad instead of putting in their cost and I mean you saw all these aha moments happening so there's a lot of opportunity to integrate into your community and at this point in herbalism it's you know a common term and it's it's like when you and I were starting Rosemary I mean we were really On The Fringe and and you know it was really you're a what you do what it was funny and I want to really honor you Rosemary for the amazing amount of work that you've done to really create herbs as a common language in our culture and yes it you have burned the candle at both ends to do that but that's what Visionaries do and that's what you are you know and without those Visions a lot of the rest of us wouldn't be able to go for walks with our friends um thank you honey yeah so all of us have these um you know these moments that kind of stand out to us I kind of call them those OHA AA moments when either the we feel like the plants staged us or they just called us um and I know you have many of those but do you have a particular moment when you you know the plants just reached out and and grabbed you I think the the first time was my first camping trip I didn't grow up camping I I grew up in nature but on the ocean and so the first time I went camping up in the ader de mountains and I was just so inspired and lit up by nature and plants and then I came home and planted my first garden and that and and actually I think my house plants maybe were a little bit before the first Garden the house plants started basic basically talking to me you know it's like and I was just wow this is amazing you know this connection and this interaction and so I just started exploring and and then um you know put a garden in and yeah breathed in all that wonderful energy of the plants yeah I know people always you know when we talk about plants talking to us you know people often times think of a language and I know Stephen berer used to talk about it as a lost language of plants but I never I've never really think of it as lost it's sometimes forgotten but one of the things that you do is you spark people to begin to hear the plant speaking do you hear any of them speaking like in a a language like a English or just how it's just a feeling you know and a lot of people will say you know I don't hear the plants I said well if you didn't hear the plants you wouldn't be in this classroom you have all heard the plans it's just you hear them it it's a vibration to me I think it's an energy it's what makes you come alive and what inspires you and no I mean occasionally I will get you know messages that will come through maybe a little more specifically and strongly and but I think what that is is my interpretation that's me putting it into my words from the vibrations that I'm feeling yeah because you know we that's how we're Translating that you know the plants are I don't think yeah that's beautiful I agree so much yeah and I also think they have so many languages you know they have so many ways that they reach out and grab people and all the very different ways that people might respond so yeah and it changes changes people's lives I mean once once you respond to that you awaken this part in your soul that is so exciting to awaken and that's another very exciting thing about classes because you're with all these other people who also are Awakening their plant Spirit energy within them and their connection yeah it's so beautiful it's like I call it plant witnessing you know it's that moment that the plants change our lives and as a as an herbal herbalist and a teacher we get to see that and and it inspires us it's I think one of the things that made teaching so much fun and made it so that we would just keep going on and on with it because you know we just for sure see how it would just change people's lives and each time it changed somebody else's lives it changed our lives you know yeah such great Ma so honey is there a defining moment in your that you remember maybe that you felt like you were actually word herbalist that you could yourself that or when you asked me to start teaching those classes and I was like oh my God and then I thought and I thought okay maybe I'm an herbalist now yeah that's come up in several several of uh the different herbalists I've spoken to they always say it's when the community tells you or somebody says to you you know they're asking for your um what you know about plants it's almost like it's not something that we necessarily pin on ourselves but that our community or somebody our elder or somebody then pins that on us it's been answered that way several times I I think you're right about that it's almost like others tell us we are now this you know before we really recognize it ourselves and a NE and that brings me to a good story I think I remember uh one of the first times when after I felt like I was a herbalist that I went to Europe and so I was traveling in Europe and um with family or friends probably both and I would tell people I'm a nalist Well everybody's nalist so like when you would tell people here at that time you were nalist they're like wow what is that what do you do and in Europe where it's you know the tradition was never broken and every grandmother and mother uses herbs they would go oh yeah you know basically look at you and go we're all herbalists that's so awesome I love that but in our culture it was very different right because that yeah that herbal tradition had been broken not so long ago it's not like lost way back in history but definitely with our generation yeah we didn't know a lot of people that you know were recognizing it was we were kind of the community that stepped forth went oh that's what we are so yeah but it is true when you travel in many parts of the world you do find that yeah so Jade is is there a a teacher that has influenced your work the most a teacher R Rosemary you are the person that has influenced my work the most oh yeah really I mean when I came as and our age difference I mean we're the same age bracket but I think that you have been so in the Forefront at such a young age that you know a lot of a lot of us who are the same age have learned so much from you and um I think that my my peers are more the people that I've learned the most from Cascade Anderson Geller you know just an amazing teacher and an amazing herbalist yeah and um and when I think about it I haven't had really any Elder Elders as teachers which maybe I'll find now I think I think you're out I think the Elder that you were the you know very close to Grandpa Roberts you were more his teacher and his caretaker oh I was thinking about Grandpa Robert yeah he was the Elder living on the earth school property yeah and you kind of took him under your wing you know I was always scolding him and you were always like picking him under your wing and and then I know you know you were there with him when he passed away you helped you know helped him make that transition to the other world that was very powerful it was very power ful because I was just called to go over there I didn't know he was passing I had no idea and I walked into a situation where I think there were two or three other people and he was definitely in the throws of dying and they were trying to keep him alive and telling him you know keep going keep going and I just knew my job was to say it's time to I agree it's time to die you can die it was it was very powerful and was definitely just a calling and I'm honored to have been able to be there that's your magic though you know you're always you're so in tune that way I've seen then you do those things not particularly that but over and over again just be there right when you're supposed to be to work your Herbal Magic with others so sweet I know you have so many herbal stories to share but I I love the story so you happen to have one that just pops into your mind now like a favorite herbal story that you'd want to share with the listeners well you're right I have a lot of verbal stories but I'm thinking about the first time that I walked into an her shop and that was in the middle 70s in Park City Utah when it was just this little tiny mountain town and without a stoplight or a condo it's kind of different now but um so I walked into this herb store called the root Celler and it literally was death down these steps and I had a cold and I my mom told me I was born practically with cold so I was used to having colds and they would last seven to 10 days and so I just walked in that herb shop and I said you know the cold B and she said here take these capsules and they were Dr Christopher's CNF capsules gosh I'm sure you remember the clate flu capsules which are mostly garlic I don't know they may still manufacture them yeah they do garlic with a little bit of parsley and maybe a few other things but those are the main ingredients and they said well here try these CNF capsules and take two of them four times a day and my cold lasted for three days instead of seven or 10 and then I was a True Believer I'm just like okay so that was a really fun herbal story yeah yeah like one of the first you know it's interesting about those old formulas from Dr Christopher and Dr cross you know we see so many new herb books fabulous books being written with all kinds of formulas but you know I still go back to some of those Dr Christopher Dr class formulas there's something about those Classics very classic oh absolutely yeah they're classic formulas you know and and new herbs come on the market and new formulas but they're all interesting but truthfully we don't really need them I mean because we have all that we need around us for one thing and then also all the old formulas are tried and true really great formulas and I think a lot of the new formulas are Slants on the old formulas you know and the other thing I I have thought about also is that in those days when like Dr Shook and Dr Claus Dr Christopher were formulating for many of them that was all there was you know not so much in Dr Christopher's days but definitely Dr C and Dr Shook that was just so much more common so they were using them for everything so um and they were just you know they were the medicines that people were using so there was just like a lot more familiarity with them yeah those it's the same with the ear books too you know like I'm astounded actually at the quality of the ear books there's a be for a while there was a while when it just seemed like every earbook coming out was kind of a refit of the old ones you know but that changed about 10 or 15 years ago and there's a lot of creativity have you noticed that as well I have noticed that and a while ago maybe 10 15 15 years maybe more the herb books Herbs were becoming so popular that herb books herb books were being written by writers not herbalists yeah that's right and I think now it is more that we're seeing a lot of herbalists with beautiful creations and I always tell my students when you're going to buy an herb book make sure it's written by an herbalist not just a writer you know and then yeah and I think too what's happening with some of the old formulas is some of those herbs are being um overh harvested and there isn't the supply that there used to be so thus United plant Savers thank you for one more of your Inspirations that continues to this day so then we change around our formula accordingly to what's more readily available well Jane you did that I want to really be thankful for you for that wonderful analog that you did you know there they did that as as a a kind of a gift to United plant saers you put together very very reliable it's been used and reproduced so many times of the analoges for the atrisk plants do you want to just talk a little bit about that maybe the process of how you came up with that list sure it was really a fun project actually because I would look at a plant that was on the UPS list let's say slippy Al which is dear to my heart I've gotten so many great results using slippery Al and then I would look at well okay we need to minimize our use of this plant what else could we use and there's never in my mind a direct onetoone analog for a plant there are analoges that satisfy maybe most of the of that plant their analog that satisfy a couple actions of that plant so when you look at like what do you want slippery El to do then you'll say Okay I want slippery to be really soothing to the GI track and then you think okay well marshmallow would fit in there really really well and so then you look at well I want slippy El in this formula because I want it as a demol for bone building and then you think oh well comrey would even be better and that's another demolon and very easily available so you just look at the action that you want that primary herb to create and then you say what other plants could do that and maybe you even need a couple plants yeah to take care of what that one plant was doing yeah that's brilliant so yeah that list is very useful people can they have access to it by going to United PL saers they still provide that analog list you did that was really awesome oh I heard you you were just talking about comrey you meant you happen to mention it and I I just wanted to ask you you know your thoughts and opinions about comy if you don't mind it's not a trick question I just really always love to know what people feel I remember that we were at Brighton Bush Hot Springs where we did a lot of herb treats right and at what we started to do at Brighton bush is before the retreat where all the participants came we would gather as her teachers remember those great ones that's yes so we were gathered as herb teachers and we were all in that beautiful Lodge and we were talking about what was up and people started talking about comrey and the controversy and I remember Ed Smith standing up and going this is like someone talking trash about my grandmother and so that comes into my mind all the time yeah that's a great one yeah and um comre is an amazing medicinal plant and I use it a lot and um I use the root I use Leaf I use the flower but I also keep in mind that um used in large quantities over a long period of time it could be detrimental to some some people and so I don't I then I wouldn't recommend you know using it but I think it's got to be large quantities over long periods of time but if somebody has a broken bone I mean that's the number one I'm going to go to number one and I just made up one of my friends just broke her leg actually and I just I've been making syrup up for her and she's having a great recovery and so I'm put in um lots of comy roots and go to Cola and horse tail and what else did I put in there a little bit of cinnamon and um it's just been a great syrup for her she's recovering really well and she's our age and as we know it takes us a little longer but she's ahead of her recovery schedule so you're a good formulator my dear I also am an advocate for comfort you know it's I always like to uh you know just it's a nice discussion to have among herbalism for those who are listening to the program comrey is one of those herbs that um there are a few SP species it's not widely found but some of them in the the young roots and sometimes the young or the roots and sometimes the young leaves there's an alkaloid called paraly alkaloid that's sometimes found it's not always found in the plant and as Jane said usually it has to be used in large amounts over long periods of time but it created quite a controversy within the herbal Community um many her blist discontinued use it many of them I like myself and I'm sure Jane did too I I looked at the research thoroughly I read all of those reports which I don't love doing but I really could not find anything that was furly saying that this plant was toxic so I take the same kind of stand that you do you know I use it anybody who feels comfortable using it I feel totally fine put it in the formulas if somebody's not comfortable that I say well there's other herbs that can be helpful but none quite like comrey com that's the thing with comfrey it has such such a special place it's so rich in that Eloy you know it's so healing for bons and Joints but I whenever I sit with the plant I always hear it it doesn't care it's going to keep on growing it's going to keep on being there and I think as time goes on we'll we're gonna find that you know the studies will be pretty much figured out to be not really have been done well or completely so yeah it's really important to look at those studies and also who's financing the studies if you can find that out and also what part of the plant is used so like Cava when that came out we used the Cava root and the studies that were showed detrimental activity to deliver on Cava were done on the leaf so it's and also what I think about is look at Pharmaceuticals look at the list of side effects that are possible from most all Pharmaceuticals and for most all herbs that list is a lot shorter and but I think because herb herbs are something that's newer to most of us and that we're not as confident or secure about any little thing that somebody will say yeah yeah we're going to get alarmed about but there definitely are plants that you know people shouldn't use at certain times then it and or ever for some people and it's important to know that but good that's a good sound good sound advice so um who are your special plant allies those special plants that you just can call on at any time that are always show up for you well I was just down in the anuro desert and so I love the desert I don't live in a desert community but I go there hopefully once a year and so your Banta I were beautiful patches of ver basanta and that's a plant that I really love and I mean I love them all as we do right but um I discovered that when I was pregnant with my daughter and um I forget what it was I some respiratory infection I had and I wanted to take golden seal and golden seal is what I had taken before and it always really helped me but there's some possible contraindications of taking golden seal and you know a dose that you would take over um 10 month um period of time so I thought well I'm want to find something else for this respiratory infection so that's when I discovered Y basant and ever since I've used it so much for so many respiratory issues and allergies and Asthma and and when we were in the desert I picked just a little bit and then I did a cold infusion and let it sit overnight and we sipped on it which was just delicious it's so fragrant or put a little bit in your water bottle and and then here on the North Coast of course Nettles I mean they say in aroma therapy when in doubt use lavender in herbalism when in doubt use Nettles so I think most all herbalists love Nettles but I love Nettles for the food nettle lasagna and nettle omelets and yeah and then as you've um taught us nesto which is pesto with nals and um when I came home from the desert I had students house sitting for me and there was a big jar of nesto on the table and I thought yes they have benefits from your students and nettle is so nourishing and I think that's a category that herbs really fill very very well they're good for acute and chronic ailments yes and there are other things for acute and chronic ailments but I don't see other things that have that strong nourishing Factor other than as a material medicine I mean there's you know walking with your friends and have getting a massage but um so but as something that you're ingesting or surrounding yourself by Nettles it just builds up your stamina and your strength and the stronger that we are and the more our Chi is vital then the more joy that we have and the more resilience we have for dealing with what comes to us every day and we all have many challenges and don't know even what the next moment is going to bring so tuck up on nles yeah daily nourishment that's what doesn't you know what we're talking about daily nourishment Jane one of the things I just have admired about used even now as you're going into your you know Elder years you still go out and put your backpack on and you go in the mountain like 9,000 feet or something know you'll do those like 10 Mile Heights with this huge backpack on your back and your dog at your side yeah I just so admired that I I I always tell Jane when she's invied me I'm gonna take my llama a [Laughter] lry thankfully as I've gotten older backpacking gear has gotten a lot lighter so I'm very happy for all those Innovations so my Pack's a lot lighter than it used to be but yes it's that's probably my most favorite thing to do is to backpack anywhere so and there's beautiful mountains close by and the serenity of being away and the fact that you have everything that you need is in your pack and if it's not you might need something else but you're not going to the store you're not going and so there's this quiet that can come also because you're not thinking about oh well I I could go do that or I could get this or maybe I should make that phone call or answer that email you know those options aren't available so it's and I really love watching the plants when you're first on a trail there'll be some invasives and pretty soon it's all natives it's all native plants and I discovered not too long ago that we have a native Dandy lion I was up in the mountains pretty high and I thought that's a Dandy lion I thought what and so I came back and I looked at my books and sure enough we have a native Danny Lion in our mountains that's crazy so is it just smaller smaller and more compact or a little bit yeah you know but it's still very robust looking Dandy lion so yeah so I you know this another question I wanted to ask you and again I'm sure you have so many stories but is there a particular like miracal story I love to call this flat witnessing too you know I was like when we talk about those times when the herbs just stepped up and you know just healed something that almost seemed impossible or whatever or just really challenging so do you have a story that you want to share with us the first story that comes to mind is when we were camping in Point Race National Seashore and we were at a group Campground we were the herb herb students I'm not sure if you were there and um there was a group of kids that were at a campsite close to ours and you had to backpack into these campsites and all of a sudden we heard a big Ruck going on and so you know you never know should I go over should I take my first a kid and so um and I'm sorry to those that came with me that I don't remember who was over there with me but I went over and I had my little first day kit and one of the children they were just rough housing and one of them had been pretty injured and look like they were in a fair amount of pain and maybe even with a broken bone and so I'm thinking oh gosh and um and then you don't know you know like what do I offer and what are people going to think and you know is this going to be but I just thought I'm going to offer they can say no the the go the counselors for these kids and so I got out my Rescue Remedy and I said you know this is Rescue Remedy it can help with trauma and shock and pain and we do want to try it and they said yes definitely and so we put a couple drops um under this young girl's tongue and then we put some on her injured leg and she went from screaming and hysterical to sleeping it just totally put her out and at that point the counselor started talking to me and they were police officers from the San Francisco Bay area and they these were troubled kids and they were taking them into the seashore into Point Rays for a healing Journey and they told me later that um I don't remember how far it was to pack out but that they they could get her out and packed her out with with her still remaining in a calm State and I gave them of course the Rescue Remedy and told them to keep taking it keep giving that to her and they said she remained in a calm State till they got to the hospital emergency room and she did have a broken leg amazing Jane you know it it's a miracle it was a miracle that that story is almost the exact same story that it's so similar when I was still living on the Russian River and I was at a big outdoor party and a little boy his name was Auggie little August Augie he was about two years old and he'd been or maybe four I think and he'd been riding a tricycle and he caught his toe in the spoke of a of the tricycle and it actually severed his toe off it was hanging there his big toe was just hanging there with them and the same thing is like people hollering and screaming I ran up with my first aid kitten the very first thing I did was give him Rescue Remedy and he literally fell asleep in his father's arms and then I rode with them to the hospital in Santa Rosa to stoma County hospital and they were able to save his toe they actually put it back on well we put it on we held it on but they actually stitched it on and he was fine yeah Rescue Remedy did the same thing he he slept all the way to the hospital I kept trying to give it to his father and he was hysterical the way it was amazing it was one of those stories I say the same thing it was like a miracle do you want to share what Rescue Remedy is because there may be some people listening who don't even know Rescue Remedy is a Bo flower essence or as I've learned batch flower essence that's how you pronounce his name and even though most of was sayb and it's a combination of five different flowers and Dr Badge came up with a system of healing called the Flower Essences there are 38 different flowers and only one formula and the formula was Rescue Remedy he he felt like that particular formula was helpful for so many people that he wanted to offer that and otherwise it was best for us to create our own personal formulas from the other 38 so it's a combination of we'll see if I can get all five I usually get four you can help me rock Rose and and catus and Cherry Plum and impatience and and what well water a well water and patience and oh what did I say Star of Bethlehem Star of Bethlehem you did it those are the yeah those are the five flowers we think I would know after teaching this how many years right so it's an amazing remedy to have and um great in your first a kit taking internally topically they make Rescue Remedy pastal now that are little candies that people like yeah they're tasty if it's open the container you got to figure out how to open it yes they're too good I eat them like candy so I have to like yeah yeah it's a wonderful formula yeah that's a it's that is a Mira Miracle story for certain I wonder wonder if those policemen still remember that story well we talked about it and they said you know we should have this in our first a kits as police officers I said yes so maybe they do wouldn't that be great yeah that would be great honey so um what do you see when you were first starting your herbal work what did you see as some of the challenges that were facing you you know when you look way back at that time what were facing you back then the challenges where people were so skeptical you know about herbs and you know what do they do and how do you know you know what you're doing and are they dangerous and you know is this going to be effective and how do you you know because there was it it was a a Resurgence of this medicine like you had said earlier that had been forgotten for a while yeah so it was a challenge um to present in a way that people could receive and at first all the classes were just all us wonderful young hippies right and then I remember it took a while but the classes would evolve to all people from all different walks of life you know it wasn't just the hippie generation that was really into herbalism it was the Baker and the grosser and you know it just started to get more popular and more mainstream when it got to be more mainstream then it there was more it was easier because it was more accepted yeah definitely easier in the acceptance I think it engendered a different set of problems you know like then we were looking at ATK plants and over harvesting and commercialization and stuff but you're right as far as it being more acceptable you know it definitely is and I agree with you there was such a shift you know we could visit we in our generation could def definely see that shift so what do you think are some of the challenges they're facing this younger generation of herbalists coming up now I want to digress a little and then I'll answer that if you don't mind because what came to me uh with this other question I mean with your comment about the problems that had come from the popularity is that you would start to see almost you know every drink on the Shelf would have some you know oh this has eonia and this has you know ashwag Ganda and so and I remember Michael Moore another great herbalist we really want to honor him learned a lot from him and when that first was happening and we're talking about there's like no plant material in these beverages that they're marketing and he said but there's green noise and it's really important to get green noise into as many people as possible oh I love that yeah that's another great quote wow yeah yeah that's that man really remember that yeah okay so the other question you asked me when I stuff was what let change the ask me well I was just wondering you know it's it's I think the herbalists today are facing very different uh challenges not necess say bad but just you know there's like a whole different challenge that faces them they don't have to worry about the skepticism or the availability or you know are there herb books and stuff so they have but they definitely have challenges facing them today and I just was wondering what you think they are what your reflection on that is I think one of the challenges is as herbalism has gotten more popular there's more of a tendency to become more scientific and to go a little bit more towards the medical model that we all were trying to change and so and I really do feel truly that herbalists now are still trying to really work and change that medical model so that it works better for people for all of our health but I think that the tendency to try to fit herbalism into a medical model is challenging and I think that it takes more um thought and or it just takes deeper thinking of how to integrate that and what to do with that and what that really means as far as herbs as our medicine how does that integrate into this model that we've known as our medicine that we all grew up with and it's not the same model and that's what's so exciting about it but trying to find and create a new model is a really inherent good challenge for younger herbalists a model that's accepted in the scientific realm as well as the folk realm of herbalism that's beautiful do you have faith they'll find that model yes that's so awesome so much with herbs your whole life you know ever since I've known you 30 40 years right but I'm just wondering when you look back what you feel the the greatest about what you feel the proudest about of all the work you done with plants probably teaching the people that I've taught because at this point in my community it's oh yeah you know I studied with you 25 years ago and um oh yeah my friend's studying with you now and then I have and then I had the Next Generation you know my mom studied with you my dad studied with you and now I'm studying with you and so I think that's what I'm proudest about is continuing to spread this knowledge and this information in an empowering way for people it really empowers people is what I see and it empowers you to take more personal care of yourself and your family but it also empowers you because you have a connection with your environment and when that connection to your environment happens your world expands and then with that expansion comes an expansion in Consciousness I think you know sweetie thank you so much for that I when you were just sharing that I was thinking about a statement that I used to make you know I would write it in my little manual when I was doing the teacher training program I did for many years and it was always to be an impassion teacher you have to live an impassion life and you have lived such an impassion life that I think about when I was thinking about when you said about you know that connection with nature and you know all the time that you spend in nature is to nurture you but also so that you have that connection with the plants so they are speaking to you right yeah yeah definitely and then the other thing that I have so admired about your teachings that I've you know learned a lot from you is just that very deep spiritual connection that you have with you know the way that you hold Circle and the way that you sing and whenever you know even in those large conferences or your small classes whatever you would be stepped forward to say pray prayer you know and just call on the spirits I mean everybody could just feel it you know just the whole Spirit energy would be so strong in those circles so and that's because you live that life it's not because you're you're teaching it yes but you're living that life and that's the inspiration and the impassion there that you embody so you have any advice to pass on let me just say one thing here so um please uh to me that the spiritual aspect of herbalism as is is as important as Nettles is nourishing and the circles that we do and the songs that we sing and that the prayers and all of that I learned in my herbal studies I learned at all the wonderful conferences that we put on and all the teachers that would come like um Brant sukunda and Don Jose and the weel medic I really want to honor their spiritual teachings and the prayers that will come through and I want to encourage um younger herbalists to just listen and listen to your own inner voice and start praying with your students and making offerings and giving thanks because those rituals are equally as important and they the quiet that comes at the beginning of class when you do a circle and everybody just I takes a deep breath and goes inside is really really amazing and I never thought I would be somebody that was going to be leading prayers in circles that's not I something that I learned in college but I just got inspired by all the times that I was part of that yeah and I saw that in you which is why I would often times step forth and say Okay Jade yeah was very and you are right I love what you just said about it's a practice also you know it's not like it just comes just like naturally it's it may be a calling but we have to practice our calling you know the other thing that you said that was really inspiring was and reminded me that we were very fortunate that um we we had so many Elders who were so willing like from many many TR different Traditions they were willing to teach us you know the songs and the ceremonies and there was a there was much more generous sharing you know they were there to learn and to give and to receive and and uh that those Earth teachings were very important to our generation and I think also honoring those teachers I think that's one of the beautiful things that we're realized you know that's becoming even more pertinent is to really honor the Traditions that that shared you know so the passing the teachings can be passed on so yeah and and when they're passed on it's just it's inevitable that they're going to change a little bit whether you meant to change it or not you know but that's kind of what happens with teachings you know you teach me I teach you you know we teach different people and it's not going to stay the same you know it's fluid and what's important I think is that the intention days the same and that the honoring of the tradition stays the same whereas the actual ceremony itself is going to change a little bit you know that's human nature and evolution I so agree and it's also the it is it's Evolution it's the way that life continues or it has to change or it doesn't it becomes stagnant oh my dear it's been so fun visiting with you always you too my closest dearest friends to this wonderful herbal Adventure we've been on I want to just thank you so much for joining us and thank all of our listeners for being here with us today and um yeah I'll
