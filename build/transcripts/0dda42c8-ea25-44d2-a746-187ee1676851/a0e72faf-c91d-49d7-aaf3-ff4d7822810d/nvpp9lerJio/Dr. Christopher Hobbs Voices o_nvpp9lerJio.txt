hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant and healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do and I can feel the [Music] sky I know that I'm part of the earth when I see the sunrise I am thankful to be here I am thankful my honored and beloved guest today is Dr Christopher Hobs Dr Hobs is a fourth generation internationally renowned herbalist licensed acupuncturist practicing clinician a botanist myologist and research scientists with over 40 years of experience in herbal medicine Christopher has a doctorate from UC Berkeley in Pho genetics evolutionary biology and phytochemistry he's a founding member of the American herbalist Guild and has been a supporting member of the United plant saver since its founding over 30 years ago Christopher is also the author of 22 books yeah and they're all great books including Peterson's Field Guide to Medicinal PL of the western United States which was co-authored with Steven Foster and his latest book medicinal mushrooms the essential guide which has been described accurately I feel as a masterpiece and the authoritative resource of medicinal mushrooms and really there's literally so much more that I could say about Christopher and all that he has accomplished and is still accomplishing in his lifetime as an herbalist but it would take up this whole hour if I was to read it all so for a full M please see our website and you can also follow the link to Christopher's amazingly informative website so Christopher it is such an honor to have you join me today you're one of my oldest dearest friends and I'm thank you so much for taking this time I'm so happy to be here with you Rosemary as always it's much easier online isn't it than flying up to Vermont but not nearly as well not as much fun but it's still going to be fun yeah it's going to be totally fun I'd so much rather have you in in here in my library or kitchen just but this is going to be good and this means a lot of people can listen to us you know I wanted to start by reading a quote actually from the medicinal mushroom book I was thumbing through it today and this little quote in the back really struck me because I think it really sums up who you are it's called gratitude so the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience and my love and passion for fungi and plants and the forests and Meadows in which they live fills me with gratitude these days amid all the good and bad news of the world I find myself more and more looking for the silver lining the positive The Good the bigger picture and celebrating the progress we have made as a race I contemplate what I can do personally to help even if it's a minusculo piece in the giant picture of life I think you've done more than a minusculo piece but you definitely have really given so much of your life to the plants and I know the plants have given so much to you as well you know I know you have a really interesting history because you began your really your plant Journey as a young boy do you mind sharing a little bit of that with us well um you know just in a nutshell my dad and and his dad's brother were professors of Botany and my dad uh when that's what really got me going on Plants is as when my dad wasn't an herbalist but but he was really a plant person and he knew all the plants and so we'd be driving around in the neighborhood uh or somewhere and I'd say what's that tree or what's that flower and he always knew every every single one and whether it was an ornamental plant a wild plant didn't matter he just knew all the plants and trees so that and of course I wanted to be like my dad and I wanted to connect with him so I I don't know I just always have you know since then was really got excited about plants and but even before that I think I I just had a natural affinity for trees and I wanted to know what they were I wanted to connect with them and so that's on my dad's side and on my mom side uh she was an artist and musician but her mom my grandmother was a herbalist and I've got a beautiful picture of her sitting at um at a table and this really I don't have that many pictures of her but this is a beautiful picture with a big sprig of Foria yellow Foria which is a Chinese herb and she used and she my mom told me well she had a garden she had an herb garden in Pasadena she was the community herbalist in Pasadena and then uh she took a trolley a red line down to Los Angeles and studied with a Chinese herbalist and this was in the 1920s I guess and right around there and I have some of her notebooks and then her mom was a herbalist also a community herbalist but she was a lady lawyer from New York and she moved out to the wild west to Montana and my mom told me that she became a Tarot reader and and was in Hera so oh wow that's that and who knows what you know past that what what my ancestors were doing but I really think of how I've been thinking recently and I I've been thinking a lot about my lineage and when I did medicine work down in South America the AR sham and said you will see your ancestors so basically I did I saw I saw my my mother and my father and my you know some other an people that I knew and then it just all these faces kept coming and and so I've been thinking about a my lineage a lot and you know people talk about past lives well I look at it as you know not that my ego and my you know my mind and thoughts and everything um are out there will be out there somewhere but just that um all my an I'm all my ancestors I'm they're in me my grandmother is definitely in me because I I really feel such a strong connection with her and and the herbs and plants that she used for healing and my dad as well I really feel that he's in me so I I know all these ancestors are that I'm basically the the current representative of my lineage you know we always talk about how the herbalism is passed down to the blood or the bones of the ancestors yeah and you're that's exactly what you're talking about and we're the current um representatives of our lineage of our whole lineage and so one of the first things that um if you do medicine work of any kind like with a traditional shaman which I've been down to South America three times uh once in the Amazon jungle with Jim Duke and which was really an amazing experience and U he's you know that that was um such a such a powerful experience for me uh personally and it just opened up uh just the the feeling of of how important it is to to represent my lineage now and really heal the heal the lineage in the sense of if there's any forgiveness of our parents or any feelings that we have that that aren't just love pure love and at the end of my first session I just thought you know it's and I've you know my brother and I have one brother and my my parents um you know I had some feelings about about them that were not always positive though they gave me so much of course um but then at the the end of the session I just felt like this incredible love just all over just radiate out and I just thought you know love is all that matters there's nothing else and um that that was really a powerful experience for me that's really stuck with me well that sounds so powerful Dr Jim Duke is another one of our great elders but unfortunately I can't interview him because he's already passed on so it was that incentive of so many of our and our friends who are passing that I was saying that it's so essential that we capture these amazing stories that we all have but I did want to say Christopher you know when you were talking about how love is it all distills down to love it reminded me of the last time I heard Dr Jensen speak so I heard Dr Jensen when I was a young girl like maybe in my early 20s and he was talking about you know fasting and you know bowels and enemas and all these things that we do to keep our health but when I saw him speak like when he was in his 80s or early 90s he just said it all to Stills down to love his whole lecture was all about loving you know and being in touch with the things that you're talking to so you're in that place now where it's all about love you've always always since I've known you which I think has been close to 40 years actually but you've always radiated such positivity and good health and love really it's really your essence and I think you're just distilling that to be even stronger well yeah I mean there's there plenty of weird things going on in the world but but you know Ria my partner always says well you know there there are a lot of negative things or thoughts that we might have and then people think well you know I have this or that ailment or whatever but then she says well you know what do you want to create yeah so so that's a that's a really good teaching that she's given me is that you know don't spend too much time thinking about those negative things but what do you want to create and what we want to create is something really positive and really beautiful that's so beautiful thank you so one of the things I another thing I really love and respect about you is this amazing ability you have to weave your very scientific brilliant mind with Earthly wisdom and spirituality you've just created this wonderful cauldron and weave these all so beautifully I just was wondering how that is for you like you know you have these very you know can be very Divergent interests but they come together in this beautiful way even when you're teaching you know you can Inspire and you know have all the chemical knowledge of the plants and then you have these wonderful stories and folklore and that beautiful umbrella of spirituality that's everything is within can you share a little bit about how that is for you I I'll have to say that um I was very fortunate and my my dad I have my dad to thank again uh when my both my parents were when they were young you were and and much of that generation were smoking and drinking alcohol so my dad was you know drinking a lot and smoking cigarettes and everything and then um he eventually had to split up with my mom when I was about 15 or 16 uh because they they just weren't healthy for each other they were both had that propensity so he and then he met maren my stepmom who he stayed with the whole the rest of his life and they they actually died about a week apart when they were when they were in their 80s so they were they it was really um such a wonderful relationship and he cared so much oh they cared so much about each other and so it turns out that uh my stepmom was a a psych psychologist uh and didn't have any addictive potential or you know interest so she was very moderate type of person which was just perfect for him but she started giving him LSD uh and that this was in the early 60s to C to cure any any craving for alcohol and I still remember him laughing in the in in the Next Room and I was going what is going on in there it was so funny for me and I was 19 or something like that and and then but he he went through two or three um LSD sessions and he never drank again after after that and so this was the early T time when people were using LSD for addictions and so forth and studying that and then he became a Zen Buddhist after that so and he he ended up taking us to which really influenced me he had some books there which I started looking at and and and you know I'm I'm not religious at all uh I don't consider myself religious at all and that's a long discussion but I am very spiritual and I always have been and then if I were someone said well what path do you follow it would be probably Tibetan Buddhism and pamama shin are really a great teacher for me but then my dad started taking us to ohigh which wasn't very far and Krishna mury was there and he was he there was this rope around these trees and Krishna mty was standing in the middle of this square of ropes and and just talking and there were maybe 20 30 people standing around listening to him and so my dad took us four or five times to see Krishna mty when I was pretty young and that that really had a big influence on me as well and he's been a big teacher for me my whole life and then and in my early 30s I had kind of a spiritual awaking I started reading uh about ramach Krishna and I read several of his biographies and he really inspired me of ramach Krishna was a big um inspiration for me even though of course he was he had passed in his physical form but uh since then you know I've I've had a very strong spiritual path uh so I I think that's always been with me and but then then I've gotten in it kind of as a root Digger and and I love being in the woods so much so so that's why I got into mushrooms I always tell people well they say well why did you get into mushrooms and I said well cuz I just love being in the forest and if you go in the forest going to see mushrooms oh yeah I know that you have a curious mind it's childlike too which is delightful so I know that you've had this lifelong Affair love affair with plants but I'm wondering is there any kind of moment that you can remember when the plants just called you into their world is there was there any like particular time when you just went a ha you know here are the plants they're calling me well when I was in my early 20s I was spending a lot of time I wasn't working I was kind of a hippie type so I just was like house sitting for people and I didn't really want to do a I didn't want to punch in and out of a job so I was just living uh in the you know at the edge of the forest and uh I used to just I was so inspired by learning the names of plants and studying them more closely so I got month the months Flora the California flora and I would just go spend a whole day just wandering in the meadow and in the forest picking flowers and then just taking my hand lens and just looking at the flower and trying to key it out trying trying to understand what it was related What that particular species was related to and how all the families are related and different Genera so I I just spent day after day a lot of time in the forest and the in The Meadows and of course I I did become very inspired by what you know if you take time to key out a plant you're sitting with one plant and looking very closely at it for hours and hours so it's kind of like meditating and connecting to that plant and I I just did that so much over a number of years that I really felt like these are my allies and I just felt such a strong connection uh to plants and trees and since then I've been kind of hyperfocused on plants and so that wherever I am I'm always looking at the road side of what plants around what trees are around what shrubs are around and I'm always checking in with them and that's been kind of a lifelong habit I'm always just mostly you know when I'm even when I'm with people I'm always just like looking looking around to see and I'll say stop the car you know there's a there's a red uh there's a red Delphinium we have to go and see that I remembered that so well Christopher when you used to come with us when we do those plant LS J journees those early ones when we were on the school bus or with our with our school tours when we had the California school oral studies and always we'd be driving to log and all of a sudden Christopher would be holler stop the bus and the whole bus would get out and there we'd be looking at a plant and we hardly gone anywhere it was those were long Journeys because of you Christopher but it was it was a delightful way to learn I definitely remember and I'm sure you still do that so is there a is there like a defining moment that you can remember when you thought to call yourself an herbalist or felt like you were an herbalist oh definitely that's one of my favorite stories I'd love to hear it I met Aden Sarah um Smith uh in 1980 when they still had Herb Farm was their whole stock was in a closet one closet and Sarah was still making Sprout bags and I still remember her lying on the floor on her side doing leg lifts and at the same time she was licking labels and putting them on 1 o bottles that was I'll never forget that you know she she was just such a go-getter that she she didn't want to just sit there and do it she was doing leg lifts and squats and stuff while she was putting labels on the bottles so I still remember that but Ed and I you know had a lot to talk about because um Ed's pretty chatty and I'm very chatty so we were talking a lot about herbs and this is 1980 when they were in that small little house and so Ed one day Ed said and I was living there for uh some six months I think one day Ed said well let's go up we need to pick some um pip cisoa so I said okay great and uh so we drove up in this in the Cascade Foothills he know where there are some big patches of pipsa which is a wonderful kidney uh herb to soothe the urinary track and so we were driving up there and all of a sudden he got pulled over by a a a policeman so there was a cop car behind us and he I guess he was going a little too fast or something or he probably maybe he had a tail light out or something who knows but anyway so he so the cop pulls us over and he said uh let me see your license so Ed gave him his license and then he gave him a ticket to fill out and I saw it on the clipboard and it said occupation and so he wrote herbalist and on the occupation and I went wait a minute you mean that's a profession that was like one of the biggest aha moments in my life really because I I just didn't I just thought this is just what I love to do but it's not really a profession I mean this is 1980 I'm talking about whoa that's a great story yeah so after that I thought wow I'm an herbalist that's my profession that's great you know Christopher I think I met you the first time up in up in the Applegate Valley right at Ed and Sarah's I seem to have this picture you'll probably remember it better than I do the story but I seem to have this memory that we were driving up there on one of our early plant lovers Journeys and we had the school bus and uh I just remember seeing you out in this big field that's the memory I have the first time I met you do you have a better recall of when we met well you might we might have met up met up at Ed and Sarah's earlier but what I remember in The Big Field was Kathy cabil and I I don't remember who and Howard and Daniel probably were and and you were on the bus and we were driving up to um going up to Washington or Oregon and we and one of the stops was in rou where Gabriel was and so we stopped at Gabriel's um what he was leasing or using this big I don't know how many acres it was but it was quite a large Garden area and he had a big truck of seaweed that he had just harvested from the coast and he was telling so we stopped there and we stayed there for a couple of days I think and he this is another really great story that I have in my mind that was a big aha moment for me and uh this might must have been 1981 or something like that I don't know exactly what day but early certainly very early 80s and um so Gabriel we're all out in the out in Gabriel's Garden and and he was talking with us about the garden and we were all there and so he pulled up a carrot and he said and then kind of brushed it off and started eating it he said this is the medicine and and that really I know it's nowadays we think okay yeah food medicine everybody knows that but in but in 1980 that was a big another big giant moment for me that he oh yeah the garden everything that's growing in the garden that's the medicine right there it's right from the earth and it's right from the garden and he's so much embodied that anyway as you know uh he just embodied that the garden is the medicine and and that was just such a huge moment for me that I'll never forget so Gabriel was my teacher at that point and just as Ed Ed was when he wrote down herbalist on on the ticket those are two really important moments but but that's I'm pretty sure that that's the first time and certainly we were out in the big Fe Garden there of Gabriel uh early on in 1980 maybe it was I don't know but that's I think that's what we it was like that 1980 or 1981 and you know you're speaking about Gabriel Howard who's also was just had such a major influence on organic farming and herbalism and Seed saving in this country unfortunately he's also another one of the elders who's passed on and then Sarah who you Sarah and Ed who you were talking about we did do I did do an interview with Sarah already and we'll be doing one with Edge soon so and he's such a good Storyteller so yeah and you know it's what you were talking about with the carrot these things just seem so common their thought their thoughts everybody has now but not at that time and that's what makes these stories so incredibly empowering is you know it'sing how we're Where We Are so you've mentioned two of your really early teachers I I know you've like I we've studied with so many different people in study just being with them and having Miss friends is there anybody in particular who a teacher a teacher who really influenced your path as it is today anybody that well first of all my my dad was my first teacher yeah obviously and after that when I left home my mom was a 7day Adventist and and hurt and so they would you know they they really my mom was really focused on healthy food so she would always cook a meal that was pretty you know we didn't have processed food so much then so it was always a very wholesome meal and um so uh but then when I left home and I I went into the army actually I don't know if you know that about me but I was in the Army for two years I I was drafted uh and then I got out as as soon as I could I wasn't really a military type of person um so when I got out of the army then I went off and and I wanted to I heard Country Joe and the you know on the radio I heard Strawberry Fields and I heard Country Joe say LSD and so I thought oh that's for me I want to because I grew up in Southern California I want to go up to the Bay Area and be a hippie so so I I did I went up there and uh and then after about a year I you know I started started eating uh hamburgers and and candy and you know I just kind of let my I I you know I was rebelling against what the way I grew up so I was eating all these hamburgers and candy and I I still remember I I started feeling weaker and weaker and I started feeling really bad and I was I couldn't hardly walk up this this hill without huffing and puffing and and I thought something is definitely wrong here I've got you know and and then I went to visit my mom she lived in Palm Springs and um so I thought well I'll go to a health food store there was a oldtime health food store in Palm Spring so I went into the health food store and there was a book right there on the rack by Paul brag so I just went oh Paul you know it was the miracle of fasting and so I thought well I wonder I I didn't know much about fasting at that point so I got his book and he's so enthusiastic about fasting and heal and you know and his whole program he always used to say well anyway I so I read his book and then I found out he lived part of the year in Desert Hot Springs which is right near where my mom lived just one little town over so I went over and I you know knocked on his door and I said I've got your book and I want to study with you and and he goes no I'm traveling all the time I don't have time so then I but I came back two or three times and finally said okay you can travel with me I'm going to do a um a talk in La next week so I went with him and I listened to his talk about and and somebody asked him well what will I do for arthritis and he goes he's he he went dears I have nothing for I have no specifics for you it's always a total program for health and so that was another big teaching for me and of course I read his book and I did a lot of fasting in those days like weeks of I I one time I fasted for two or three weeks and so that was a big Turning Point another big turning point in my life and then I got even sicker after that because I was cleansing of course I was eliminating a lot of stuff and and uh but eventually I you know I I started feeling better and then from then on that was my healthy diet for the rest of my life basically then when after 1980 I mean every herbalist I met was was my teacher teer you were my teacher and and for just um so many things and uh especially your big open heart but so many others Cascade you know I I learned I learned a lot from Cascade I remember walking one time up in Portland we were uh I lived in Portland for a couple years and casc Cascade and I were pretty close and one day we were walking out in the forest there on um on the River on the Big River um and through the woods and and I I we were doing a talk at the Northwest herb conference together and and so I started coming down with this with a runny nose and a scratchy throat and I was feeling bad and I said Cascade do you have any um and we're walking along next to the river in the woods there and I said Cascade do you have any eonia on you and she said eona why do you need eona there's Wild Ginger growing all over around here so just so she pulled up a little Wild Ginger and we start chewing on Wild Ginger and yeah my cold got so much better and then I started reading that it was a Chinese herb for the immune system and for my throat and respiratory tracts so Cascade that's just one example of you know Cascade um teaching that she had and then we started going to conferences together Brighton Bush and so you know obviously all the all the herbalists were all were all learning from each other at that time and so pretty much David Winston uh David Hoffman any all those herbalists were all teachers for me we were learning a lot from each other yeah totally I so agree we were all it we were all learning from each other and creating family and Community together as we were learning it was a really remarkable time and still is yeah thanks for bringing the up Cascade she's also another one our beloved herbalist Elders who have passed on but thankfully Elliot is publishing his her her husband is publishing um a book about you know of her work so that should be available you know we will'll have at least we'll have all of our classes or teachings still available Christoper I love these stories i' learn I feel I I've known you half my life and i' we've talked so often we're so close but I've learned so much just in this one story that you told is I never knew your mother was a Seventh Day Adventist I was raised as an Adventist as well my mother and father were also Adventist so yeah that I didn't know definitely I probably had yeah I know it's like when you said that it's like so that got us started off on a very very good diet for sure and then I really never knew about that little short time you spent in the Army I I have to agree that you don't really seem like the Army type but there's always something to learn everywhere right and yeah so many good stories I def defin don't remember the story of with your with your first teacher Dr brag I mean he was amazing so yeah such great great yeah I just read his books like you did I never knew that you went knocking on his door yeah great stories so yeah do I was gonna wanted to ask if you have a favorite plant story I know you have a zillion of them but if you could share with us just another favorite plant story of you know a plant that you love I don't know how to pick one out you know there's so many that do pop up in my mind as as you have I've taught hundreds of plant walks so those are probably the best stories that I have just people that didn't that were too familiar with herbal medicine or herbs or plants and they're so curious and excited about learning more about the plants and we've LED so many plant walks and I some of the best stories I have are just students uh stories of of getting to know like wild ginger one of the stories which oh I've got so many as I said but what one that pops out in my mind is that I was teaching up um in Nevada um with uh and actually at a conference a week-long conference and uh Black Elk was there and some other teachers were there and and um I was leading an herb walk and and um there there was this man on the on the walk that every herb I talked about he would just pick a kind of a double handful and and eat the eat the whole thing so I said well here's Yaro and I was talking about Yaro so he picked up there was lots of yarao around he picked like three or four leaves of yarao and a flow and he he was just like munching on it and eating he wasn't just munching on it and tasting it he was he ate the this whole handful of Yaro and then uh you know we were walking along and he said and I said well this is Desert parsley which is pretty harsh and he'd pick a handful of seeds and flowers and he would just eat the whole thing and then pretty soon I said well you know we around the conference center there was some poison hemlock so I said well this is poison hemlock and I talked you know told the story about Socrates and that the that the seeds and were were the most and the roots are the most toxic especially in the summer and fall and in the spring they're not as toxic so he was picking the foliage of the of the poison hemlock and just eating handfuls of the poison hemlock just going yeah I just said I don't know if that's a good idea or you know he just eating the poison hamlock and and some other herbs and and the next day he was fine he he didn't experience any so I don't know that t that was kind of a I started after that I started eating eating more plants every time every time i' you know see y or something I'd eat two or three leaves and just to experiment and bring the medicine into my body without having to make a tea or you know and I still do that I still go out in my garden and I'll I'll eat some thy or I'll eat some oregano or you know whatever so that was kind of a but you know like you I've got I've got lots and lots of stories like that I always like to you know taste with all you know get to know the with all my senses as well you know just a little bite like when I'm out in the woods or whenever I you know I smell it and look at it and one time when I first moved to New England I was on a walk and there was plants here that I wasn't as familiar with for certain because it was a new habitat for me I saw this plant I sort of recognized it but I didn't know exactly what it was and I I was on a family walk you it was just with friends and and I was behind everybody and I took a nice big bite of it and it was the most accred bitter flavor I mean it was one of those times I'm looking for chickweed I'm looking for sassa leaves anything to like mellow the flavor it was Cel andine right it that's harsh yeah that one was pretty harsh but uh yeah I'm surprised you know sometimes the leaf of the of the hemlock actually can make people nauseated it's not poisonous um but yeah it's a and a couple well then another couple of quick sto stories are one time I a couple of things that another things that pops up in my mind one time I was with Michael Tiara and out in uh because we did two or three um back backpacking trips uh in the early days with Paul E school and we took students out in the High Sierra and so we saw some aoia uh snake root which is the most bitter herb I've ever tast it in my my whole life and and I just happen to have some with me I so I was taking drops of it just to because I was experimenting with it to activate my immune response because it is a very powerful immune uh regulator and so we saw it and we were talking I was talking about it and then and I said oh I just happen to have some tincture of it and I took a took the dropper out and Michael said let me try some and he took a whole dropper full of it and he squirted it in his mouth and that I've never seen him react like that before he just went oh my that is horrible so I remember you know those types of stories but then the other one that I really enjoyed is I was up on another backpacking trip and and uh up in the very high mountains and there was a lot of this Yaro around that was uh kind of a purple Yaro because of of all the ultraviolet get it had from up there and it was a poly Ploy so some some plants like Yaro and and valan double their genome and they create polyploids and so they double or or even more they amplify their genome up in the High Country because the ultraviolet will cause cause their genome to double in the Next Generation and so there is this very special Yaro up there high high high mountain Yaro that was really dark purple and really dark and big Stout and so we made sun tea we we picked a lot of the Y we put it in hot water and left it out in the sun for quite a few hours in the hot sun and then shook it up and I was drink I drank quite a bit of it I drank like a half a qut of it and pretty soon I started hearing sounds I started hearing Bells like a Tibetan bells or something and I was going wait a minute this is really strange and I I had to light down I started to get really dizzy and I started to see like these colored dots floating around and but mainly it was just like all these sounds of of music and bells and everything and that lasted for about a half an hour and I thought you know there must be hallucinogenic properties of really super high mountain poly Ploy Yaro and and since then I actually read a couple of studies on it that there are some compounds that are slightly mind alter ing so that that was a very interesting um oh story so fascinating yeah so so fascinating kind of rather totally amazing so Christopher I know you've also been a practicing clinician as well you know and has have a practice and I'm just wondering is there any particular story that jumps out of a time when you saw herbs just I know this again is one of those questions because there's so many but just a story that might pop up of a time when you saw a plant kind of work a miracle something really amazing um that you'd like to share with us well it's not so much one one case you know that one dramatic moment it's it's like having a practice when I had my clinic in Santa Cruz and and um because I had hepatitis twice when I was young uh once from going overseas and another time I don't know I picked it up when I was 19 uh in a restaurant somewhere uh in Southern California as infectious hepatitis not hepatitis C fortunately or B but it was infectious hepatitis terrible experience but but anyway I had it twice and so I was very interested in in the LI I got interested in the liver and Liver Health and I started reading the scientific literature in at UCSC science Library this is very early on uh in the 70s even 60s the late 60s and um so I started reading that thisle was a was an herb that in in Europe and in Germany they were using for hepatitis and for for promoting Liver Health and this is in this is literally in the six 1968 I think and so then I I I was yeah and so I went over to um in the East Bay uh in the Bay Area and I I noticed that I knew that there was milk thisle growing all over the place uh spiny heads and purple flowers and you know the leaves with the Milky bands on them that's why they call it milk vle supposedly it's Mother Mary's milk dripping on the leaves and so um I we started harvesting the the spiny heads with gloves and we' let them dry out and we shred them in a shredder and then we we um poured it down into a fan to to get rid of the fluff and we collected the seeds and then we made extracts and this was in 1968 and when no one had really heard of milk thisle and so so I started using it my digestion was not very good at the time so we I started using a lot of milk thisel and water uh it would turned cloudy because of all those active compounds and my digestion started getting better and better and I was feeling really good and uh and then I had a liver panel and my liver enzymes were were really low and I thought wow this is a really powerful medicine so I wrote my little book on milk thisle the liver herb and that was in 1968 that was or 1969 and that was the first book that I little booklet that I wrote uh and then when I had my clinical practice in in Santa Cruz I had a lot of um then I wrote a book called um Natural Therapy for your liver a little book little book um it's a uh just describing how to use milk thisle and other liver herbs and so I had all these patients that had um hepatitis that would come to my clinic and at one time I had over 100 patients with hepatitis and and I made formulas but the one of the main parts of the formula was milk thisle and then I would give them my little book how to take care of your liver and I and they were getting liver liver panels and and uh and also they had hepatitis C A lot of a lot of my patients had hepatitis C uh and in those days they didn't have a real cure for it like they like there is now and uh so it was always a total program but it turned out that looking at the numbers the viral loads came down people's liver enzymes came down so I literally saw many many patients that where their their um their liver enzymes and their their viral load came way down when they were taking a lot of milk thisle so I was I was really dazzled by milk thisle and that's always been one of my really uh favorite herbs I love that dazzled by milk sissle it is an amazing herb it's so common much more common on the west coast than out here we can grow it but it's actually not happy in the Northeast but on the west coast all along that whole Pacific Northwest it's just abundant and even as a wild food it's delicious you know it's such a greater but yeah I know you did so much Bring It Forward in this country another thing that's so interesting about milk thisle is that in the European hospitals they keep the extracted hospitals because people do so much more mushroom identification there you know so it's what is it this um camarin in the mushroom I think in the in the extract they use as a you know I think they need to start keeping it here and I always have it on hand because my husband Robert and I we love to go out mushroom eat and I just keep it just in case I think it's smart don't you yeah for the um because uh amonita fides the death cap has really it's a weed in in North America but is spread all over the West Coast under Oaks and every year there's at least one or two poisonings with death caps Europe many many poisoning cases because they're so popular over there but but yeah milk thisle is the main herb to use the main it's the main medicine that's known really to help cure that Matthew have you ever heard Matthew Wood story about his friend uh who forget her name but Susan Susan who ate uh some amonita and was really really ill and he was giving it to her on the way to the hospital and when she got there she you know she was still sick but she definitely recovered and the doctors even say it was because Matthew was giving her that milk thistle extract all the way to the hospital it's a pretty remarkable it's a great one yeah yeah that's a good story too I I wonder to mention that it's not so much about herbs but it's about um you're also this collector of rare herb books you know like that's another thing that you've done is you've amassed an incredible collection and resource right of thousands of books I know whenever you'd come to visit me there was that really neat old bookstore you and David used to try to get there so you could get there first to get the the but um I know you use it as a resource what are your plans do you have any longterm plans for your library well um you know it was David Winston and Bob ruia my my herbalist friend in that lives up here in Placerville and I were the three main herbalists that were just book crazy it's like arasmus said famous quote he said uh he said if I get a little money I buy books and if there's anything left over I buy food and clothes so were kind of like that we we just couldn't help ourselves and remember in those days in the 80s and and early 90s we didn't have the internet we didn't have all this information that we have available now and there were all in the 80s there were only you know a handful of really great herb books maybe uh so we just had a we just wanted to collect books I ended up collecting 8,000 books uh which is going overboard I I agree I'm really realizing that now but it was sure great stories of going over to England with David and and Bob and and collecting all these wonderful herbals and garden books and and uh I learned so much uh about the people the doctors and the and the even even midwives that that used herbs and wrote books and so that was a really important part of my life but now you know we don't need the books so much because well for me my teachings are more now are are different than just facts I don't I don't really focus on on all the chemistry and pharmacology as much anymore now it's really just about uh the spiritual more spiritual and energetic side of healing with plants and Foods uh as you know you've been you've been there all the the whole time but I really have come more and more over to um that that side of healing and and uh so and I have enough I have enough information in my head I don't need any more information really so we're we're cutting the books and scanning them and we're we have a um a nonprofit called the world herb library.org and we're putting them all up we have about 300 books up so far and um so you can go on to World herb library.org and you can search all of these 300 books for say time or oregano or whatever you want and it'll show you all the different occurrences in in these books and then you can open up the book and you can turn the pages it looks like the real pages are turning uh flipping it's kind of three-dimensional so we're offering all that um to the world and so that's what we're doing uh the last year we've been working on this and and so I'm offering these books to the world we don't want to break up our libraries and sell them we want to give us of course some of them can't be cut and scanned like the old herbals and so forth but but many of them I think around 60 70% of them are we're going to cut and scan and digitize so you can search them you can look at them online and and that's what that's our project that we're doing now that's a Wonder wonderful project Christopher that's so awesome another great gift that you're giving to the world yeah so we're kind of running out of time but there's a few more things I wanted to ask and one is uh if you were to oh I think I did ask you if you if you had one favorite plant I bet that was the milk thistle right was that the milk thistle story if you had one favorite plant like if you had to choose one plant that would be your plant Ally is there anyone particular that jumps up I know it's so hard I can hard do that no I I I mask that like you are probably as well uh I just don't I can't think in those terms because I really um the can I tell a quick story I was um you know rainia and I were um in uh at Wilbur Hot Springs about three months ago and and in Wilbur Hot Springs there are these beautiful basss and it's way way way out in the wild uh not near a town and so we wanted to do some medicine work together and so we went to one of the camping sites which has a platform there this was a really profound experience for both of us and so and and we're all wrapped around where the plants and my some of my favorite plants and trees and the the ancient blue Oak Forest and it we we were just and then we we we didn't eat that morning we we um you know purposely didn't had a very light light breakfast and then we went up there about 10:00 and and um it was sunny and blue sky but it was kind of wrapped all around by the plants and trees and and so we brought some rocks and we brought a few plants in and we set uh we spent a long time setting an intention for our journey and then uh and then I uh rainia is so good at setting intentions and has has just beautiful words for for prayer and so we so I really thought about my allies my the trees and the plants as my allies and that they're always there with me and and so I started thinking about the blue o the blue Oak and there there the Indian warrior was there and and some other of my favorite plants the lam desert parsley and I just started uh really um making making an in just a really beautiful connection and and gratitude with those plants and trees that are such an important part of my life and I really started thinking them these are my allies that I can call I've just spent so much in my life connecting with them that I really felt like I can call those my allies in and so with for our medicine journey I called my allies in and we had a sprig of desert parsley and we had you know a sprig of of blue Oak which is this is the ancient blue Oak Forest that we were in and and we had just such a beautiful experience uh with our medicine work and I just felt my all my allies around me and it was such a such a beautiful experience but my point being is that I can't really pick out one herb because it it's just it it's all of the plants and trees that I love so dearly and wherever I go Europe or wher South even South America the urubamba valley my plants are allies are there they're they're always there it may not be the same species but it's going to be galum and it's going to be querkus and all these other beautiful trees and plants and and I just um this this medicine opened me up so much to this connection that I and love that I have with with the plant and plants and trees allies and and it was just such a beautiful experience oh I can feel it and I know just what you mean you know it's that deeper connection like it is incredible to learn you know all the science and the chemical constituents and how the plants work physiologically in the body and that's you know that in itself is a Marvel but when you really get into the spiritual relationship with the plants it's when they really start exploding inside of us and and I think that's what you're what you're speaking to you know just that incredible connection and relationship we have with this amazing green world around us the plants that's the medicine that's the medicine same with food same with food if we go out in our garden and you know we pick the carrot or or the Tomato out there and it's just so so much our our medicine you know I remember one time Christopher something that I read I heard you saying was uh about a time that you had a really bad cold and you didn't have your herbs with you and you were wondering where the herb shop was and then you walked into a grocery store and you found everything you needed in the produce department do you remember that time yeah I I do I did a reel on that and and I made a video from my University of Massachusetts course I teach a um a 4unit herbal class at University of Massachusetts for the last five six years and I have an intro video and I show the I you know I I did the whole video and everything and I yeah I was at Whole Foods in Texas the largest Whole Foods in in the world at that time I was going to do a a class the next morning but I started getting this really bad cold sore throw runny nose uh felt felt really bad and I thought well Whole Foods there's bound to be a medicine here somewhere and so I walked down the aisle and there are these big tall aisles and you know how it is in Whole Foods or some of those big markets and there are just like hundreds of supplements on both sides and and I'm you know I'm thinking well wait a minute which one is going to be the best really and I started then I passed a break in the in the aisle and I saw the produce department over there and I thought oh wait a minute what's over there and I walked over there and there was garlic and you know there was they had bundles of thyme and oregano and I just thought well here's the medicine right here I don't why do I need any of those pills or tablets here's the medicine right here and so I just got some garlic and I got some thyme and oregano and I brewed the thyme and oregano up in the in the coffee maker in the in the room tastes a little bit like coffee but and I drank a few cups of that and I was I crushed some garlic and put it on my dinner and and the next morning I felt great yeah such a good teaching it's such a good teaching yeah that realization that you know the medicine is all around us in our kitchen you know I think that's the reason that fires cider became so popular me all the formulas I've made that one there has just become worldwide but it's because it was really a grocery store and a jar right it was all those healing plans so you know Christopher you have a really accomplished so much in this lifetime you know from all the teachings I mean it's amazing all the places that you teach you're still doing classes at Yale and Stanford and you know and Massachusetts and then all the herbal conferences worldwide and the books you've written which are just wonderful books by the way you know and then all the herb walks that you've LED and um yeah just in all the people that you've helped with oneon-one and of all of these things what is the thing that you feel the proudest of with that gives you the most pleasure when you when you look back you know and or look forward what are the things that you feel the best about well again it's not one thing but but what what I really what a big there are some big turning points of my life maybe four or five major turning points in my life but one of them definitely was um my dad had a my dad had a doctorate he was a PhD in botney and and his dad be his dad before him and so I always wanted to get a PhD I always wanted to get more more science training and uh I waited a long time because I was just so restless so when I was older I I just had the opportunity uh we moved to Davis I was I started at UC Davis to get because my my um undergraduate degree was in art history in music so I had to get a whole new science degree for four years and then so I went I went to UC Davis and and uh and then I did some work also at sax state but I got my undergrad degree and then it turns out that that I um I saw that at UC Berkeley they had a new lunchtime uh talk and so a friend of mine said well you should you should go and talk about Native Plant medicine there so I went over you know I went I emailed them and they said sure come on over and it's all the professors and you know we're would get together and people in the department there the the botney department or integrative biology so I went over and I had my Peterson guide and I started talking about local native plants and and then I told them well I'm I'm look I'm going to apply for um graduate school and and at UC Davis and and they said well you should apply here uh we like what you were saying so I did apply to UC Berkeley and met my major Professor Bruce Baldwin who is just a an Old Hippie and deadhead himself which was really interesting he was one of the main botanist in the in the UC Berkeley Department there and so I went you know seven seven more years years of hard science training a lot of genetics a lot of ecology it was um it was called there it was integrative biology so chemistry uh ecology evolutionary biology and I did a lot of lab work and you know traveled all over collecting plants and so and did a lot of math a lot of lot of intense math and and Science and and and then I finally ended up graduating but a lot of people asked me why did you spend all that time getting all that science training and what what was the most important um benefit from doing all that 10 years of hard science training and I said well and I just thought and thought and I realized that what I learned was uh and the most valuable is not all the not all the knowledge and the you know and the facts and chemistry it was just that I know nothing I know absolutely nothing this world is so miraculous and so mysterious that I absolutely know nothing that's what I learned I unlearned everything that I thought I knew and not only that but it taught me great flexibility of mind so those were the those were so valuable for me and I still have them with me and that is that I just feel like flexibility of mine and and admitting and sadguru which is one of my teachers now always always says what's wrong with just admitting we don't know and so I really feel that it's so important to admit that we don't know so many things we and when we make a decision about something or we think we know something we're closing our mind so that's what I learned after all those 10 years is that I know nothing I it's so miraculous that's so brilliant Christopher you know just so brilliant I know those were really hard years too you studied really hard every time I saw you you were like studying and just working so hard but what a brilliant conclusion to come to and you know I had I had a couple other things I wanted to ask you but that is such a beautiful place to to end and to just for all of us to just receive and I want to just thank you for everything that you've done for plants and mushrooms and people in this earth you you know you really have given your life in service and and your light and vitality is just beautiful you know you're definitely a radiant Elder for sure so thank you Christopher for sharing your stories and you know just being a part of this wonderful session that we're doing with interviewing the elders I really so appreciate you and love you dearly we're doing it together Rosemary and it's really uh it really has been uh a group effort and uh and our community our heral community of course is one of the greatest Gifts of our life uh and it's still going on and so I just honor you so much for your lifetime of service as well and just the this beauty of being in community together has been so precious yeah it certainly has I always say that you know I love plants with all my heart and so glad I was called into service to them when I was young and I also love the people that love plants I just think they're some of the most gifted brilliant heartful compassionate and hardworking people on the planet so thank you sweetie it's really true Rosemary but I just the last thing I want to say is that I really just believe that I'm just a channel and so what we're we're all once we connect to the plants and the trees and nature uh we're just purifying and and clearing our Channel and then we get to channel it and we don't own it we're just channeling it through and we we don't you know we can't take credit for it really it's just coming through and we're working on honing and clearing our Channel That's So I really do believe that yeah thank you thank you [Music] rary I am thankful to be here I am thankful to be here [Music]
