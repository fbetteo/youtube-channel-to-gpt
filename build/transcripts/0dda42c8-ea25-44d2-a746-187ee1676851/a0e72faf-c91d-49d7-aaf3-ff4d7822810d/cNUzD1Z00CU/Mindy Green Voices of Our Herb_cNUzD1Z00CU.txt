hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant in healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do I of a bird and I can feel the I know that I'm part of the earth when I see the sunrise I am thankful to be [Music] here my esteemed and honored guest today is Mindy green along with being a remarkably accomplished and Brilliant individual she is also one of my oldest Dearest friends Mindy has been involved in the herbal and healthcare industry for close to 50 years and she's accomplished an unbelievable amount I'm

accomplished and she's also as I said one of my dearest friends so Mindy it's just so wonderful to have you join me thank you so much for being here Rosemary it's my pleasure it's wonderful to see you as always and I look forward to our conversation here we'll go down memory lane I'm sure yeah we definitely will because we we met each other really before I mean we were in love with plants and healing and herbs but really before we' done anything right you know we met in the early 1970s actually and worked together at the gerville natural food store those were actually incredibly wild and wonderful days I know for both of us do you have a favorite story or stories to tell about those early days on the river you know I think I'll share the story about when we met it was 1971 the late fall 1971 and I was delivering my homemade desserts to a local restaurant in gerville called Brothers restaurant it's no longer there but the building is still there it was a big yurt a round building which was you know amazing in itself in 1971 and uh I brought them into the kitchen these cheesecakes that I made and you and Drake were in the kitchen and I mean we were all hippies and so the site of another hippie couple wasn't that unusual but Drake being what six seven and you're like my size 53 or something and Drake had on these muslin beige yoga pants and a short cropped like kind of t-shirt and you were all hippie out and it was just you know the the magical moment that our our souls got to reunite yeah yeah I remember that I remember that evening at Brothers I actually think I have pictures from that night but I also remember so much of just seeing you in the gville natural food store so I was sort of the cleaning woman you know kind of I eventually became the the herbalist there but I started out as a cleaning woman you know and I I'm always really proud of that you know I started out by cleaning the bathrooms and coming in after everybody was done work but you worked in the juice bar and I just remember this incredibly vital just brilliant you know life force coming off of you so yeah was pretty neat yes I love the juice bar yeah and then I always am very proud of saying that you were in my very first third class I ever taught was in my living room and in fact when I think about it you probably were one of the people who are prompting me to teach and the reason I say that so proudly now because I really feel like you are my teacher you know you I just think you are one of the really best herbal aroma therapy teachers I know of in this country so I I always just you know really with pride say you know midy was in my very first Earth class well I think more than anything I asked a lot of questions and so you helped find the answers so we prompted each other to learn a lot more together so do you have any story to tell from those early days in the in the herb class anything that you remember pop out I think well there's a couple one one of course is your very first herb class which was when we were coming into your house we had to sh away the family of raccoons that lived on your porch so we made our way into your house and the subject of our class was was magic mushrooms and not those kind they were real marinated edible mushrooms and we just added lots of herbs and garlic and talked about all the those things but the second memory that I have is when we I think it was the second class too we made dream pillows and we had gathered the mug wart because it grew all along the Russian River there and we gathered it fresh and we stuffed it into these pillows that we sewed ourselves and we had other herbs you know Hops and chamomile and lavender and all the other things but the M we the next time we met which I think was either a few days or a week later how did it go with the with the dream pillows and I was like well I woke up in the middle of the night and I could not sleep I had to I had to just get rid of that thing and you said oh my gosh me too and I threw it across the room it gave us such crazy nightmares and I think that whether we used too much or because it was fresh you know whatever we were young and didn't know very much about what we were doing we were experimenting and that's a lot of how we learned is making all those mistakes in fact I remember getting together with all of our herbal girlfriends and sharing what was the biggest mistake you made in the last time since the last time I saw you and Cascade was famous about sharing these kinds of things too Cascade Anderson Geller and we learned a lot from from those things and I think we were just so young and naive and didn't know that we shouldn't be or couldn't be doing these things you know and I think that's a lot of how many herb companies got started we just didn't know that that we were being naive and and kind of frivolous and for most of us we made it work well we did there was just incredible dedication and openness to learning I think but I still think it's the best way to learn actually is just experience you know and um yeah I I do want to mention something about the mugart too like when I moved to the east coast I would tell people still to make these dream pillows and add the mugart but people stopped having those wild dreams right because the mugart here is very different it's a different variety than the mboard that grows on the west coast and the it's really that wild I think it's the ardesia bulgaras that grows out there yeah it's the one that really stimulates it gives you these incredibly wild colorful dreams but the East Coast doesn't do that at all it's good a good medicine yeah so again just learning we were still experimenting and learning absolutely we stumbled our way into into today yeah still AR stumbling but yes a little older older and wiser we hope anyway yes we I know that you've had you know a lifetime of AA moments with the plants but I just always love hearing that story of just one that pops into your mind right now you know maybe when the plant saved you or when you knew you were going to follow them like just that aha magical moment if you have one of those stories to share with us well there are a lot of those stories and I think a lot of them unfolded in the circles of the conferences that you started in the early days in I think 1974 was the first one and we would just gather in circle and I just felt like I found home and found my tribe and this was my dedicated path and as you like to say we learned to walk the beauty way you know and the plants called our names and you don't you don't resist when the plants call your names you just you follow wherever they Le you well it's really taken you down a lot of paths h a lot of paths all all kind of in the same you know natural products industry type of thing but I've enjoyed the variety and I think that in every step I've brought you know we always bring our past with us and our past experiences that unfold into new teachings and learnings as we move forward in life you know Mindy one of the things that I've really admired about you is how you've branched out you know aromatherapy and your cosmetic work all involves herbs of course but you become you would go on and you would just study these you know and just then it kind of it's like you took your herbal work down many different stream lips and Riv lips and then you combine them all beautifully you know I've heard you say that about the plants it there's so many different ways so you mind sharing a little how you know about those different Pathways and how you've integrated them I moved to British Columbia I think it was about 1977 or 78 and so all those years from um you know the early 70s till then we both worked at gerville Natural Foods together and of course you were doing all of those wonderful teachings and I was an avid student and and devout follower and you were the first person that had essential oils and at your store at your little you know the little closet that was inside gville Natural Foods before you started Rosemary's garden and um it truly was like a hallway so there were on both sides of the walls it was lined you you know it was just you walked up and there was the counter and you had your herbs behind you but then there was another shelf and those were all essential oils and I came in there one day I mean it's just like three steps away from the cash register the juice bar you know and so I walked in there I'm like oh my gosh you have like some concentrated version of Rosemary here you know and lavender I think you had Rosemary lavender you eucalyptus peppermint and probably some citruses to start and to me it just made so much sense to me aroma therapy is a concentrated version of herbalism with some caveats and you know different things that you you should know before delving into them instead of the herbal path which is safer and um you know more more whole and holistic if you will and I always if I'm teaching a class about herbs to aromatherapists or a class about aromatherapy to herbalists you know there's always a mesh you know they they have obviously similar uses and um I think it's just a way to kind of plump up your herbal therapies especially in external applications for your body and but also a concentrated version to just have that extra um hit of nature in your day with whether it's a diffuser or like me I have my little you know aroma therapy inhalers next to my desk here and I have my little Aroma theic Rays here and you know just to combine them all and you know if it's a oils or hydrosols which to me are really a distilled herbal tea or your herb tea which you know never go without yeah exactly so to me that was a super easy transition and uh it just made a lot of sense to me and I love the way you could combine them um not just in in skin care but in all all forms of healing you know Body Mind Spirit kind of things and I don't think that's different for herbs either it's just a little more tangible almost in a different way in terms of the strength of their Aroma but you know when you have your herb tea it's really important I mean you taught me this you know you smell it you taste it you take it in you enjoy it and one of my things that I say to people and this includes the medical professionals that I teach at the University of Arizona these are overwhelmed docs whove just finished you know their whatever 10 years of medical training and then they've been in private practice and then they're taking on a new Fellowship which I of course applaud them I call them you know the hippie dogs who are open-minded enough to learn about plants and and integrative care and many modal but I I say to them you know if they say you know what's better a tea or a tincture or a capsule or you know what do you recommend and I always say first tea because if you slow down enough to make a cup of tea that's half battle right there you know and with Aromas right from your cup or the essential oil that you're smelling when you open that bottle or have your tea and in front of you and you're inhaling the fragrance I mean you're really inhaling nature and you know we this oxygen CO2 exchange with the trees they they exhale the CO2 um I'm sorry they inhale our CO2 and we inhale their oxygen that they that they exhale so once you know that how can you not be moved to the truth that we are all connected you know and so when you smell something that you like the aroma of you take a deeper breath and when you take a deeper breath you slow down everything I mean the whole point of meditation is to focus on your breathing and when when we are inhaling and by the way to inspire means to inhale and so you're taking in these plant Aromas that are doing all of these things which we can talk about later but just generally changing our brain chemistry you know by the chemical constituents that we inhale from different essential oils and plants they can stimulate they can uplift they can relax whatever and I think it's just so powerful and just the act of take making the tea and slowing down enough to sip it mindfully and breathing in those Aromas and when you like that odor you just take it in I I've been on walks I'm sure you've done this you're walking by and you're like what is that smell SM you know and you just like all of a sudden you're just alive en livened you know and I just I love that and how can you I don't know to me that just feeds my soul it's part of um what draws me to continue in this work and what Drew me into it in the first place is that it is just such a beautiful very libran you know Beauty walking the beauty way and and and bringing all these pieces of beauty plants and flowers and herbs and seeds and all of these things I mean what is more beautiful than that and spending time in nature we know how important that is and it helps us to slow down and when we slow down we reduce stress and 70 to 95% of office visits to medical personnel are because of stress I tell the docs when I'm teaching that if you take away nothing from this aroma therapy class here's the one piece of information that you should remember and that is when you like the odor of something you bring it into your body and it slows you down and when you can slow down your nervous system and enliven your Vagas nerve then you are supporting your parasympathetic nervous system and already you've you know that's half the battle I don't know if I that was such a great answer I forget even what I asked you but whatever it was it was just a wonderful wonderful wonderful response I followed you it was like taking a journey I kept breathing and getting calmer and calmer we walked through the Garden on that one so beautiful I know that's another thing I forgot to mention you're an Exquisite Gardener it's amazing what you do and a good Homemaker and yeah it's just kind of you're remarkable you know I I do want to say to all of the people listening that vindy actually is my go-to person and actually for everybody who knows her like when we have a question about anything anything you know has to do with herbs or aroma therapy or health we just email Mindy but and then you know I did mention this is all that time you worked at the herb Research Foundation you know you were like doing you really love research as well as actually just yeah I know and then and then the other thing that and you might want to mention this a little bit but at the Brighton Bush herbal conferences that we used to go to all the time up in uh it's a beautiful hot springs it was just such a gathering for herbalist and and there was I forget I think it was Tim Blakeley who brought the game what was it herbal herbal trivia right so our good friend Tim Blakeley he created that game right for us and Mindy always would win it was like everybody wanted to team up with Mindy because she knew all the answers to all of the trivia questions year after year after year did you ever lose Mindy I I did lose but you know the key was picking a good partner you know one year I had Kathy one year um and of course she her whole newsletter is a lot of trivia bits and all her history and mythology she's fantastic about that I think one year I had Amanda McCade profer know know I was gonna beat her intellectually so yeah yeah it was it was fun those days were so much fun and herbalist it was a surprisingly competitive budge if you were um pit against a team of say David Winston and Ed Smith you know get out of the way you know they they're ruthless they're going to win you know it was it was so much fun and we're all such great friends and I think part of the friendships that we forged in those early days were because we were these kind of Lone little tiny groups in different places and then we we learned that there were other people like us you know oh my gosh you like herbs too and you were instant fast lifelong friends all of them are still our lifelong friends it's wonderful and amazing I always say we came in on the Same Soul very true yeah and I I do want to mention too you know one of one of the beautiful things at that herbal at those herbal conferences there would be just like today there would be so much sharing there'd be so much you know people just exchanging information we kind of grew up together you know learning from one another and then in the evening times there would be these wonderful games and sitting in the hot tub so yeah it helped to form a really strong Network a family that was always growing you know it was expanding now it's so big it's hard to know all the family members but they're out there you know making making their own circles but Mindy you know it's hard to answer this but I always so curious is there a moment that you remember when you actually called yourself an herbalist or really felt like I'm an herbalist is there is there like a moment that you can remember when that happened for you I know that's kind of a hard question it is hard because it was a transition and you know for me I really entered that world through my interest in um nutrition and healthy foods you know working at gville Natural Foods and then you know reading about herbs of course we all had John lust and Back to Eden that was kind of the only herb books that we could find in those days you know but um Nicholas cul pepper and we were just all so amazed and then The Eclectic Physicians and things like that so I think I mean there were moments definitely that I just felt connected to Nature you know when I was a child you know I didn't grow up you know this I didn't grow up in America and I lived overseas and um I didn't have television or anything like that and we lived in the Asian Far East and so I would go on these hikes and I would leave really early in the morning every weekend and I would pack my little you know bag for snacks and water and I'd go off by myself and uh it was of course an Air Force Base and so you know I was enclosed in this little mini America you know um but i' I'd be walking out there and it was tropical jungle and I would just sit in awe and look around and you know there'd be V you know Tarzan Vines you could swing on and all these amazing plants and if I it was it was the Philippines and so they were in World War II I saw a lot of machine gun shells and things like that you know from the war and things but other than that um it was just an amazing place and the Tropics still speak to me that's that's where my heart lives in those warm humid fully green climates not like Colorado where I am now and it's snowing and so that was that was a big moment you know just kind of the my interest in nature one day I when we were in British Columbia and I stepped out of the door on our on my way to the herb store you know that we had and all of a sudden nature would I stopped and I was just like what what and it was just yelling at me we're here we're here and so that was a confirmation more than an inspiration I think but really stopped me in my tracks it was quite amazing you know just being kind of under your tutelage for so many years in those early days um my interest and acknowledgement grew of the plants and all of their just amazing healing powers um not to men mention some of the other plants we invied with that there was always that I know there was always that joke among the herbalists in those eras that you know there was we all came into plants not all of us but a lot of the herbalist came into plants to the one master plant right and then we ranched St from that but yeah you men your time in British Columbia so I that's always such a really incredible period for you because you had the Herbs store there and also an her Pro school right yeah it was amazing and you probably will um attest to this too you learn so much by people asking you questions and then you find the answers to them and then you gain that experience and you pass it on to the next person who asks that same question or you know in a class that you share it because it was such a profound experience in learning and and teaching for us all so we were experientially driven in a lot of ways and that herster went on even after you left Canada that store was it did and you know what I was in uh Victoria BC last spring in May and um I found the store of course I know where the store was and I think it was like some hot dog stand or something now but there was another store and it had moved downtown and I had seen that before when I visited back there again but it finally did close the self heel herbal Center and um on one of the main streets downtown just a few blocks from where it originated down on the waterfront so one of the great things of our time anyway we've had the really wonderful opportunity to study with some really great Elders I know that you did as well and I'm just wondering if you could just if you have any stories to share about any of the elders that you studied with well you know in the early days you and I got to meet Dr Christopher and um he was just such an amazing character I remember he'd always go on stage and the first thing he would do is take two spoonfuls of cayenne and wash it down because he had a lot of arthritis and and that was his go-to remedy and I remember one morning I took two capsules of cayenne pepper before I came to work at the herb school and by I'm at the herb store gville natural foods and I don't know if it was you but my I I think it was you I was my heart was pounding out of my chest and it felt like I had five cups of coffee and so I caution anyone probably not a good idea maybe a very small amount on your on your food or a tiny um single a capsule or something but anyway that was a real teaching that was experiential that was good and then of course Norma Meyers Norma was you know the amazing fantastic uh Native American Mohawk Indian woman from alert Bay the island that was across from the island that we lived on Malcolm Island where so Tula was and um her husband Carrie was the tribal leader you know he's a fisherman like a lot of the the native people there were fishermen and you know I mean you were there in the early days when we first got there and um she held that conference we kind of put together this conference um on alert Bay in this big L house this Native American Lous some people that were there just went on to do amazing things like well I think Michael Tia was there you came you had a little Entourage with you and Steven dentali who was like 19 years old at the time he went on to be the chief scientific officer for Opa for many many years and anyway a a big group of wonderful herbalists and um so uh you know you know the story of Norma she she there's so many stories with Norma and she was so fantastic and what I remember mostly about her is that she would never go anywhere without leaves stuff stuffed into her toque which was a Canadian kind of knit cap and she always had Alder leaves and she was especially fond of the Alder trees and said they were cure you know she made a lot of outrageous claims but she was such a character and Jim used to describe Jim green used to describe her as an encyclopedia with no index yeah so she was she was a wonderful wacky character and I adored her and she just had she had zero boundaries about anything her house your house yeah and she was wonderful and giving and caring and loving you were very fortunate you know I felt I felt like I was a good friend of hers and you know I knew her I traveled up there maybe two or three times that had her come to the herb School the California school of over studies which was I have so many great stories from that but you and James had such a special relationship with her you know really knew her well and you know I think in some ways really helped her she definitely found um acknowledgement you know Jim was really good about bringing her into the herb community beyond the native tribes and her small circle in Canada and so of course a lot of Canadian herbalists knew her but she you know she was on an island you know and she didn't have a lot of reach and so we brought her down a lot to do classes at our herb school and she would do a lot of herb walks and she was she knew her plants inside and out and she lived them she really really did live them and I don't know I think maybe you you heard the story but she and and and Jim go way back because they taught school together at a regular high school and Norma was the biology school teacher and when they fired her because she was too outlandish with her suggestion of getting the kids out there organic gardening as part of the biology class and so when they fired her he quit and they started an herb store together up there called the Sun and seed and it was a little not herb store health food store and they had a bakery too yeah that's beautiful I remember that Jim had written that little booklet about Norma's life I hope it's still available because really uh there's you know she's living uh she lives on through all of us who knew her but she really needs to live on for future generations of herbalist because she contributed so much and because she was such an incredible wild woman yeah she was a wild woman wild as the plants yeah wild as the plants we had the opportunity well you were actually still living up in uh up in Victoria up on the island Vancouver Island and I really wanted you and Jim to come down to teach at the herb school so I enticed you to come down there and then when I left the herb School you actually became a co-owner and a faculty member there for many years after I left so I would just love for you to share um you know a little bit of your experience being at the herb school and if you have a favorite story or two to tell when your time because you were there for actually I think you ended up being there longer than I was I was there for the first 10 years but I think you were there even longer I I Liv at the school for seven years and I was there for 10 years but I and I will tell that story but before that the very first herb bus tour you took with your students was up to our school in British Columbia in ilano the Gypsy the Gypsy bus the herb school bus and you brought all of your students up and we exchanged students and we taught your students and you taught our students and that was amazing and so of course we you know when I was ready to come back um I of course I wanted to come to the herb school I got to I got to go to Herb school for seven years and I got to hire any teacher I wanted to learn from um at herb school and I you know I wasn't the only one of course we had quite a nice a nice cast of characters and staff members there including Tim Blakeley and and Amanda McQuade Crawford and David Hoffman and it was and then we just hire all of our friends to come and and share and we just you know life was a party it was wonderful and um the herb school had a quite a history I don't think we have time to go into the history of the herb school here but you know before you got the herb school but there is a Grateful Dead connection which you know for another time but anyway herb school was fabulous and it was sometimes referred to herbal summer camp when it was just a shorter program and then I think it became a nine a nine or 10 month program and um and a lot of the students that went there went on to do amazing things amazing herbalists and I know that Deborah oh Deb Soul Deb Soul yes and Karen Sanders and um I I just so many people ASA walstein I think I just saw little ASA he was there probably when he was 18 or something and he just got on Ward from Opa for being you know something in the herb industry and then of course David um David who worked for Herb Farm bunting David bunting yes I mean they all fabulous herb careers Sunny Mel started herbs for kids I so many Inspirations and you just you just dropped all these seeds and they they blew to the four corners of of the the Earth and started wonderful things so I think I think that's that's probably the biggest inspiration that you could have as a teacher is to just Inspire others and a lot of the students there are now the teachers there in fact bought the herb school and they still have it and um Trinity AA teaches there and just so many alumni yeah it's amazing it started I think of the uh in the late 1970s and it's been you know it's considered to be the first herb school you know in the more history in the longest running and it still just maintains that remarkable uh reputation I think one of the things I love so much about the school it was instilled in it from the very beginning was it was a lot about learning you know information and and all kinds of information about plants not one particular path but you know we brought in lot shamans and we brought in you know clinical herbalists and we brought in aoba therapists and you know flower so it was just this really eclectic uh flowing river of information but even more than the information was just connecting people to that spiritual nature of the plants I think that was and that maybe is what made it so inspiring for people because you know it was like it opened a doorway inside themselves that they could just travel into and travel down and be with the plants but yeah for myself too I think some of my dearest moments or that time spent at the herb school with all the students and the singing and the you know the potlucks and everybody coming together and singing at night around the campfires yeah and then the The herbal medicine show at the end of every graduation the students just got to show off what they learned what they made how you know the product line they were going start you and James actually brought that to the school the medicine show and that has spread to almost every program now in the country I know I started immediately started doing it in my Center here in Vermont and then you know you see it every everywhere now which is it's such a perfect way to complete where the students are now showing and sharing all of their products and trading them and bartering them you know so it becomes and with Jim because he was so into like theater theatrical he would have us all dress up right so we dressed as a as your favorite medicine person I came down one time dressed you know with all my flowing hippie clothes riding my horse you know Galloping down into the center of the show on my horse back oh yeah you had albums and albums and albums of pictures of all every single year and you know I really want to acknowledge Tim Blakeley for the beautiful garden that he created there and I know it's been fostered by so many wonderful people since then but it was I think it was unique in that you had a Hands-On herb garden where you could pick you know grow and tend and harvest and dry and process in the little herb School lab it was really unique for its time and a lot of people have copied it since then and and wonderful we need to have more of that but it was it was such a unique experience I think for the students at the time yeah thank you so much for mentioning Tim because he Tim actually came to my very first her class that we did for the school and I he told me the story I forgotten it but it was like I came up to him and said you want to be the gardener at the new herb school and he sideon I don't even know if he how much gardening experience he had at that time I probably knew that figured he's the perfect person but then he went on to do the uh to establish those incredible Gardens at Herb Farm and at Frontier herb company so he went on to create beautiful gardens uh you know beyond even his time with the herb school so yeah another wonderful person and for all of our listeners you know it sounds like all we did was play music and party with the plant but we were serious about our studies we were also serious about playing and and caring for one another and you know just just creating Community but we were incredibly serious about learning um well we combined all of those things yeah and what better way to learn than when you're having fun and and feeling fulfilled so you've got you know you we've talked about a few of the things that you've co-founded and businesses that you started and ran but I mean I can just think of a line of you we talked about the the herb store that you owned in the school up in British Columbia and then also the California school studies there was simplers botanical you have your own Consulting business now are there any just any particular stories or lessons or anything you want to share about any of these multitudes of things that you've created in the world I have to say I never had a plan none of us had a plan to become a Ness because there there wasn't even a word I don't think there was there was not that word there certainly was not that career and so we were just following our hearts kind of naively blindly happily joyfully just being with with the plants and and I know we were all concerned with this was the beginning of the ecological movement and Recycling and that was a that was a big thing for all of us too was just caring for the Earth and cleaning up and making Beauty you know and and what Tim did in the in Emerald Valley with that Hillside just you know it was just a Hillside and he made Beauty and so we were just all interested in creating beautiful things in our wake you know and um so I was always interested in skin care and so I in the years that I lived in Emerald Valley I went actually went to Aesthetics School while I was at the herb School in um in Santa Rosa and then I started working at a couple Spa in the Napa Valley doing facials and and massage I went to massage school too in Sonoma and you know just kind of expanding the repertoire and I didn't know why I just thought well that would be interesting and you know none of us is we're not making money we're kind of making a living by cobbling together three or four kind of careers you know time here and there and um I think it was just you know the path just led me to different places and when I moved to Colorado uh you know brijit Mars was here and she begged me to come here and I'd been teaching for feathers School the Rocky Mountain Center for Botanical studies for a number of years while I was still living in California and so I moved here I had kind of a built-in Community already of herb friends so kind of my next transition and so teaching there and then um I started writing some books you know and I never set out to do that every article or book that I wrote was because somebody came to me and asked me to do it and um so I I have to say I like the Articles the goal was shorter you know you're the author of many books um that was a you know a little much but yes uh that was fun and uh and very uh very Hands-On experiential learning when you have to be so detailed and organized about writing down information um but then teaching classes I just always liked that and um so then I when I worked at the herb Research Foundation with Rob maleb and that was the kind of the beginning of of the American botanic Council and herb Research Foundation so ABC and hrf and they were very much sister organizations and we did a lot of the research and then Mark took it and started publishing herbal gram Magazine with a lot of the you know collaboration that he had with Rob and uh while I was there it was right after the dietary supplement health and Education Act passed and they allowed for herb companies to make soft structure function claims if they had substantiation so then I was at first the director of uh education and then later the director of research at hrf and so when we had clients and these were all the major big herb companies um they'd call us and I need um a monograph or research papers on this or that herb because we're doing we're marketing this or that or you know so that was partly my job to do that we had a staff of probably 12 people I think at at the peak but anyway I found that really interesting and then from there I went to the an shuds Cancer Center that you mentioned at the University of Colorado and it was actually the um if I can remember the title integrative uh yes Center for patient care something like integrative resources for patient care people who were getting cancer treatment and they wanted to know what else they might be able to integrate into their treatment protocol our little Center there offered them options not products but information and so from there I you know got a job offer at this big Cosmetics company and it was it was a beta and they had just well not just but they were owned by Estee Lauder by then but horse was still there um the first day I went to work horse was there he wanted to check out who they just hired because they had never had an aroma therapist there an aroma therapy company and C angerhofer who was still there for their um can't remember her title director of scientific or anyway we both worked in the herb research division of R&D the plant research division Botanicals yeah so I was there for seven years and that was great and that really when I read their what they were looking for it read like my resume which was surprising because nothing was planned and nothing was you know I had this background in plants and I was an aesthetician and I had done some teaching and writing and so forth um but quite frankly every job I've ever ever had and ever had was a job that was never there before I came and you know how you know I mean you started the Herbs store who had an herb store before then you know we all just kind of stumbled our way into these into these things you know so yeah and then I moved back to Colorado that's kind of the short version lots of little path along the way and including being on the board of United plant Savers which was so fabulous and Aida was such a great supporter actually I remember one time not so long ago I asked you what it is that you love most about I we were just having a conversation and I asked you what you love most about your time at aeda and you looked at me and you got this enormous smile on your face and you said it's because I was able to get big grants for United plants saers and those those were the early days in United plants saers right so funding was such a huge issue for us and because of your networking with they had so much respect for you there and because of your connection with um United plant saers we you know you just were like a you just made it really easy and so that really helped get us get UPS going you know so that was wonderful yeah well I don't know if it was you know they had so much respect for me because they didn't really know me there you know it was early when I was first hired but um I knew who to talk to I knew who to influence and and we had a great argument for why they should support United plant Sabers and it made sense to them and they're envi very environmentally conscious um much more so in those days when the money flowed more freely than now and things are tighter everywhere yeah that was that's so true that was wonderful so yeah um I just wanted to ask you you know in all your years of working with the plans if there's a particular time or story you want to share with when you saw plants like work a healing Miracle either on yourself or with somebody where you just saw them just do the thing that just makes you drop on your knees and give thanks for the plants you know there are many of course many many I think probably my ongoing amazement for an herbal remedy is something that uh we made it simplers called injury oil and of course you know we were apprentices for herb herb farm for Sarah and Ed and they had the original product I changed it a little but the basis which is what every herb student learns is arnica St John's Ward and kenela Infused herbal oils for bruising and all kinds of impact injuries and then I added a whole bunch of different essential oils to that and that still blows my mind to this day I use it all the time I have dozens of stories I'll share one story with you which is pretty amazing I mean lots of stories from when the kids were little you know but this one was uh I was I was living in Boulder and I was riding my bike and I wasn't going fast or anything but I just kind of fell over on my bike I was at the edge of a sidewalk and fell over and it really just hit my hand really hard and I was only a few houses away from my my home and I kind of pushed my bike home and I got home and and I put the injury oil all over my hand I had like gravel in my hand and stuff like that injury oil all over up to about here and and it first of all it stops the pain almost immediately and I mean any of my kids and grandkids will attest to this because as soon as you put it on they stop crying in like within five minutes you know anyway so I put it on and having all of these years of experience with it thought oh great I won't bruise it'll be fine I won't get W in or anything and the next day I had bruising all the way up my arm from where I stopped putting the injury oil I put it just a here and it bruised all the way at my arm but not anywhere else on my hand or or it was amaz that was amazing and I have lots of those kinds of stories you know slamming my hand in the car door and you know all kinds of things but that was that was a real Testament and now I don't go anywhere without it it's in my purse at all times and I just have this little tiny VI but that's that's amazing and you know the Cula and the St John's wart I you know they're so high in those beautiful plant pigments and those um bioflavonoids really help to keep the Integrity of the small blood capillaries that burst open and that's what causes the bruising and so they allow the elasticity of these small blood capillaries to stretch and Shrink without breaking open and that's really what stops the the bruising most people are like I don't know why it works but it just works and then the essential oils just add that extra layer of of anti-inflammatory plus this the fragrance of the blend that I use is just so beautiful that helps to calm you as well just breathing in those beautiful plant fragrances so that's that's kind of my go-to combo remedy is there some place that makes and sells the formula or is it something that everybody has to make well you know IR Farm makes their um trauma oil I don't know that they add any essential oils to it for a long time they did they might add lavender now I'm not totally certain about that but they certainly sell each of those arnica St John's W and Cula so you could blend your own you don't have to make them and I think Gaia makes something like and there's a lot of her herb companies now that make those and of course just to let your listeners know that arnica should not be put on broken skin so if it's Road Rash or something then often times I will keep uh just the St John's Ward and Cula in a separate bottle so that the arnica won't disrupt the healing of the broken skin which is what it can do you know arnica of course is great as an oral if it's in a homeopathic um but arnica tincture as you know should not be taken internally it's very irritating to the the mucous membranes in the throat and I don't know the details about why I know that it prevents skin from healing on an open wound so if you have Road Rash or your kid is you know come in with just a scrape knee or something you know even aloe vera and Lavender is good if they No don't touch it you know and a lot of tincture sting and alcohol stings and so just a little spray of of um or a dabbing on of kandula St John's wart and something as simple it's just adding lavender to it but of course I add German chamomile and Yaro and HRM and all the great anti-inflammatory essential oils which one was that again hone panaceum an annuum blue tanzy and the German chamomile which has the the blue or the Roman camomile doesn't usually turn blue but you know that is a it's an interaction between the Heat of distillation and the isolate uh constituent mattress that's in camomile so when matrine is exposed to heat it turns to azuline in chamomile it's matrine that gets transferred metabolized you know Cascades down into I I don't know the the terminology but it changes to auline yeah so blue our German chamomile CO2 extract is not blue um but it has more it has azuline in it but azuline is 10 times strong I'm sorry it has matrine in it and matrine is 10 times stronger than azuline oh my God that's such interesting thank you see see how it is with Mindy it's like you could do ask her anything and she's going to know yeah sweetie thank you for sharing that so you know I just wanted to ask you um are there any are there any really special plant allies that you have always called upon either for physical or emotional just plants that you just know are there for you and I you know of course how do you pick your favorite child kind of thing you know but uh I would say among them definitely the Cula you know I did write that little book when all of us all of a whole bunch of us friends were asked to write this king is a series of herb books and I know Roy Upton did one and brigit did one and Kathy I think did one and Christopher Hobs did one and there these little like 100 page 120 page books and mine was on they said which one do you want to do which plan I said I'll I'll take Cula if no one's you know swipe that one yet so um you know yes that one and probably because kangela is powerful and gentle you know there's research on it for cancer and it's safe for babies you know that it runs the gamut and it has so many uses externally internally for food when something covers all those bases it already you know it's already a champion for me um another one would be lemon balm you know I have a tiny little backyard and um I have my favorite herbs planted in there you know I have a little Nettles I love the Nettles and really just one or two plants will service my needs for an entire year and uh you know I carefully trim it let it grow back again some of them do that you know the nettles in the and lemon balm both will do that and so I kind of harvest it I have to keep it controlled because my yard's so tiny and um so I get a lot of harvests over the years for that so fresh you know lemon balm fresh water tincture or Moon Moon tea you know leaving it out in the elements solar tea Moon tea you know the lunar infusions are beautiful um I love the mints I love basil I have all the culinary herbs in my garden because really hard unless you have somebody's Garden that you can Harvest from even organic herbs sometimes are not the quality that I want for my kitchen and so I'm kind of particular about that so those are just among a few of my favorites I could you know I could go on and on um chamomile chamomile gosh I grew telsey basil last year in my cenul bed because I had enough Cula from the year before so you know they they rotate but they're all favorites you know what's amazing Mindy is that I've been visiting you at your house a few times and you have um this beautiful garden right in downtown Boulder where you live in your backyard but it's very small and you still are able to grow everything that you yeah yeah yeah people can grow stuff like that I think I did an article for I think it was Martha Stewart's m magazine um on you know planter growing and there's of course tons of articles on that from other people as well but you know if even if you live in an apartment and you have some access to a a patio or sunny window you know you can grow beautiful things so Mindy we're coming to the end of our time and there's a couple more things I wanted to just ask you about so one is like when you think of herbalism today and what all of the young people are coming into herbalism now which we just see this amazing wave of young dedicated you know they're just as crazy about plants as we were yeah but the challenges are very different these days and when we had started you know when we were starting our studies there was like a lack of books a lack of not schools or the quality of herbs really we we were lucky if we got straw we used to say you know because people weren't growing organic plants and stuff and all of that we've we were able to help all but there's a whole new set of challenges and so I'm just curious what do you think are some of the challenges that are facing herbalist today well first of all I yeah I'm so heartened to know that so many young upand cominging herbalists are kind of carrying on the banner of herbalism and I think it's here to stay I don't think that it will die off and have a have another uh need for a Resurgence I think you did a really good job of planting lots of seeds throughout your career with all these young herbalists but I think one of the biggest challenges is that you can't just start an herb company you know there are so many regulations I you kind of can if you are a country herbalist in your community and there's not a lot of FDA um you know oversight in terms of of uh labeling and of course all the lab controls that you need now to sell herbs so if you're selling herbs at your farmers market or or products at your Farmers Market which I still see you know locally a lot um then you can get a foothold but I think it requires more education these days than it used to I think to get a job in the urb industry if that's your passion um there are more opportunities now than there used to be but there are also barriers you know there's I think that it at least what I see in of course I I worked in that world for quite a while and to get into there you you know you have to be um a pharmacogn or a biochemist or I think you need more education still there are a lot of people making it work without that like we did we we made that work um but I I still do think that just carrying on with your education whether it's in a more Community herb classes or College and and by the way there are a lot of herb classes at College these days you can take herbs 101 at you know Santa Ros J or you know it it's just I think it's a lot more places I know Minneapolis I had friends who taught those kinds of classes there and even just to see the University of Arizona's integrated medicine program um and what they teach there they teach everything from you know they have classes on iron vaa and Chinese medicine massage and of of course mindfulness meditation that's huge and um and that can be incorporated with herbs and essential oils and you know we used to do aromatic meditations and there's lots of ways to combine all of these things but I think it still takes some creativity it's a a bit of a moving Target as a lot of these things have proven to be but I think if you're passionate and you're educated um at maybe you just got a degree in botney or horticult culture or um you know Master Garden or something like there's a lot of ways toer into the world of of plants yeah that's awesome thank you so much for that yeah it's inspiring yeah so um I think my the last question I have for you is you've done so much and we've only just talked about a few of the things that you've done as I said like when I you know I watched you through your whole career and then I read your bio and it's like oh my God she's even more amazing than I know to be but when you look at the things that you're most proud of that you've done with your herbal work what would you say you know that that you have given you the most Joy well I it's GNA sound a little strange I think that it is that I made my teacher proud and that's you and truly Rosemary I think that you inspired so many people I want to just truly acknowledge how much you gave to our industry and over all the decades and you're G to make me cry because it's so heartfelt but you know you are such an inspiration to me and to so many people and and you brought so many people together and people that were um teachers of of both of ours you know Cascade and and and and Jane and and Sarah I'm going to name all of our garlic Queen sisters you know but basically I'm just proud to carry on the seed that you planted in me and and it really truly I think any of us who who knew you back then or even just met you are so inspired by the work that you did from your heart and gave to the world and I'm just so so blessed to have met you so early on you know we grew up not far apart when I left the the tropics and moved to California in 1963 three you were just the you know next County but the the county between us was Napa you were on the west side of Napa and I was on the east side of Napa and we found each other and I'm so so very grateful for that and and I'm just proud to be in the industry and proud to carry on what you taught me thank you Mindy I feel just the same you know it's in such an incredible lifelong journey so um Mindy mentioned the garlic queens and it's a secret society right of older herbalists course we were younger herbalists when we all got together we always said that the garlic Queens always had this juicy odor about you could always call it garlic Queen undertone of garlic and is the inspiration for this novel I've been thinking of writing for 40 years called Chile garlic Chile barle and the garlic Queens the story of love passion and herbs and you you want seeing Mindy's name mentioned in it but if you look closely you'll see my in The Bu the names were changed to protect the guilty so thank you Mindy so much for joining us and really I want to thank you for your incredible dedication over the last 50 years to you know the herbal and healthc Care movement you've done so much and really have been such an inspiration to so many people and yeah I hope you write another book I love your books your your book got a you see I'm done with that little articles maybe yeah you're so smart but um yeah and and I did that again just based on your teachings and your love and your support and your encouragement over the years which I know you do for every student that you meet and I think that's one of your great great gifts Rosemary is that you you acknowledge people for who they are and where they are and they love you for that and and Beyond the teachings just you know the Beautiful Soul that you are and so I'm I'm so grateful to be here and to share with you and to see you and um next time it'll be on a private Zoom call we'll say hello from across the continent thank you VY thank you everyone for listening in on these personal interviews with our elders and uh I know Lindy doesn't look like an elder but she's just taken such a
