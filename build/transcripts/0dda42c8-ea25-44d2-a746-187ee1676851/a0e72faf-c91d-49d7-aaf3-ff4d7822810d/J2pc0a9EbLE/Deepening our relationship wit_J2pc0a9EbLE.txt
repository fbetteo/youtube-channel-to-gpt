one of the most beautiful things about herbalism is that it's a personal healing art as time goes on you develop your relationship with these plants and it's not only about the plants and their healing components it's how you work with those plants and if that sounds a little esoteric i might say that every single herbalist that you talk to or study will they'll look they'll confirm that and they might have a different way that they say that but so much of healing is the personal relationship that you have with these plants and that's what you're always developing very early on when i was first working with plants one of my early teachers a man named sweevo brooks he said to me once he said you know i'd rather be the type of herbalist that knows 40 uses of one plant than an herbalist who knows one use of 40 plants and really that's always stuck with me because he was talking about deepening and deepening and deepening your relationship with a few plants to where you become medicine with them
