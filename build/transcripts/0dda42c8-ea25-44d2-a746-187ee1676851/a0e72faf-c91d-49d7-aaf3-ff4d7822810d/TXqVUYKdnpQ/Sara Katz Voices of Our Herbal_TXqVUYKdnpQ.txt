hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant in healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do I hear theong of a bird and I can feel the sky I know that that I'm part of the earth when I see the sunrise I am thankful to be [Music] here my welcome guest today is Sarah Catz Sarah is not only one of my oldest dearest friends she's also one of the people I admire most in life why well because she's amazingly brilliant creative hardworking good-hearted and above all one of the most generous and humble people I know I know I kind of get tears when I talk about Sarah I think of Sarah a little bit like Wonder Woman dressed down but when no one's looking she puts her cape on and flies Sarah's the woman in the background doing all the work while others are bowing and taking credit but there's a lot of credit we can give to Sarah she's the co-founder of the internationally known herbal Products Company Herb Farm which was one of the companies that really established the quality and integrity of herbal business she's a founding member of the American herbalist Guild one of our really great associations for herbalist and she served for two decades yeah that's 20 years on the board of United plant saers and 10 of those years she was our Mighty president she has served on numerous local and National Bo boards including that of the American herbal products Association Sarah has organized multiple herbal conferences and events throughout the United States including four amazingly successful United plant Savers conferences which were fundraisers for UPS in its early days she's lived for 45 years in the mountains of Southern Oregon where she continues to serve on the board of Herb Farm I might also add that Sarah is a proud member of the garlic Queens a secret society of older still very juicy garlic loving herbalist Sarah thank you so much for joining me today it's really a joy to just be able to to sit and chat with you like this thank you such an honor and pleasure thank you for inviting me Rose Mary to participate yeah so I know your move to the mountains of Oregon was instrumental in both your development as a person and an herbalist can you share what prompted you to move to Oregon and how that may have affected your herbal and life Journey yeah so I grew up in Florida which was a bit of a concrete jungle and I didn't grow up in a family that appreciated plants very much at all but there was some I think which is true for so many of our generation an inner voice that just yearned for the wild The Call of the Wild and I looking back on my earlier life I realized that every opportunity I had to be somewhere that was filled with nature and plants yeah called me and that's that's where I went and so after I you know did my college education and and early crazy running around time and I decided I needed to find a career she decided to be a chiropractor it was my my choice to please my father to do some kind of profession and still be in The Healing Arts because that's what I was called to was the world of natural healing which was just flowering around us at the time yeah so I feel so fortunate to have grown up in that garden and then called to it so I moved to Portland partly to get as far away from GL as I could you know I it was always a manifest destiny for me for over a decade the green Wilds of Oregon called to my heart so in a college high school friend actually was in Chiropractic College and told me I would love it there I hopped on a Greyhound bus and I rode across the country and woke up in Portland and I have to say I've always there was this homecoming feeling when I got off bus in downtown Portland people were so friendly the air just smelled right and that's where I found my home so I went to Chiropractic College for two years and while I was there I realized that actually this doesn't work for me I don't want to be in a little cubicle as much as I like the idea of helping people with their health care being in a little closed up cubicle was not really where I wanted to be and in that that group of Chiropractic students there was a fellow there who named Arie Fryman who started the New England School of acupuncture do you remember Arie yes I do character and he decided to start a nature pathic College based on herbal medicine yeah and he enlisted Dr John Christopher who was one of our elders at the time yeah and so I joined this group of uh very Visionary and AUD ious little group of chiropractors and and herbalists and Ed Smith he moved out from Boston to be part of this project W to start this nature pathic college so that's how I met Ed and herbs and got called into this herbal cast and that was it we actually did start a naturopathic College it opened up it was the Pacific College of naturopathic medicine which is a little lost chapter in naturopathic history yeah it went on for two or three years it actually our first uh school was in Mont Monto Rio I remember that yeah just down the road from where I was living that's right that's right it was an old building and we started the school there and uh so around that time you know Ed and I have been working on this project together for about four years and we connected and we decided that we didn't want we were sort of done with the administrating and meetings and all that it took to do that college and I was yearning to move to more wild place in Portland so we did sort of a methodical look at where we could move to be somewhere where nature you know where nature was um everywhere and it was also away from nuclear power plants and all that big concerns of the day and we ended up in southern Oregon wow that was just just doing a lot of teaching I had quit chiropractic school at that point because I was going to then go to the natur pratic school and become a Natura and work with women's healthare but I got diverted from that because once I started experiencing plants and the col of the plants that fascinated me more than anything uh it was just it just spoke to me I just loved being out with the plants touching them smelling them collecting them gardening all of it so we moved to Southern Oregon and uh to Williams and actually that little story is is a little interesting because at that point Ed was doing a lot of teaching he was coming down to California school ofal studies and teaching and he did a class in ashin it was part of our quest to check out this area actually and in that class we said there was a b place around here that would be you know a great place to live and someone said you should go to Williams there's a lot of herbalists there so we got in the car and drove across the Valley from Ash over to Williams and we went into the General Store and we said we are the urb and they said oh just down the road not tedo Road there's the Southwest Oregon Ro Association so we down here and there was this group of earthists and they were amazing people growing beautiful plants Gabriel Howard was wonderful Gabriel and so we we moved here and that was it I mean we just every day was a new adventure and a new Wonder and a new plan the rest is history right you know it's so interesting Sarah all these years I've known you I I I'm really hearing new things in the story and whenever I think of the Applegate I always said it was you and and Ed who made it such an herbal Mecca right because it's an it really is one of the meccas of herbalism in the country there's just I think there's an herbalist there in like every half mile or maybe even more so many but I didn't realize that there was already a group of herbalists before you arrived there yeah there were amazing herbalists doing incredible experiments with plants and then you of course Gabriel he had seven herb gardens mandala herb gardens going on at any one time his father lived here he had a home but he was still a little bit homeless so he ended up staying with us for quite a quite a lot of the time he with us and and Ed was traveling a lot so a lot of time is me and Gabriel and we did you know I gardened with him that's where I mean I learned so much from Gabriel about growing plants and the beauty of plants and the magic of of you know Sarah since we're mentioning Gabriel and unfortunately I won't be able to interview him because he's one of our elders who have passed on he was incredibly instrumental in herbalism in this country and in seed saving is so many things but so many of our listeners will never have heard of him do you mind is sharing just a little bit about Gabriel and the great work he's done yeah I would love to yeah you know a lot of people describe Gabriel and I think it's so true as a plant with two legs I mean he just he had a magic way with plants such a leader in and he he taught a lot of people he inspired so many people and I think he was a lot of what lit the fire in southern Oregon with so many people and Drew them here and for us he he gave us our first echon plants you know he he started them from seeds and in a time in NE nature was even being grown in this country he introduced a lot of the cultivation of a lot of medicinal herbs that weren't really being grown very very well plus his Gardens were incredibly beautiful you know they were always full of flowers and and mandalas um you know he just was a magical Gardener the weather in southern Oregon which is where he grew up didn't agree with him that well so he moved down to southern Mexico yeah and started a center down there and a lot of people walked down there to to work with him uh he he was a fountain of of knowledge yeah and I don't think any of it got written down it didn't that's the thing it's true he uh so it is important to remember him in in our words because he was uh certainly an inspiration to me and to Ed and to so many otherb I would say really to thousands of people he he worked on some huge projects with seed saving and then he went down to New Mexico for a number of years and worked with the native people there actually helping them to be able to Chronicle their seeds and their traditional Heritage plants and he he did some amazing work so well thanks for I'm so glad you brought him up it's just wonderful to hear about these people and anyway I I wanted to get back and just ask you you and Ed Smith uh founded Herb Farm I think it was in the late 1970s and if I recall correctly at least in my memory there really weren't any other tincture companies available in this country and that this was if not the first one of the very first and I would say the thing that really set Herb Farm out was that from the very beginning you and Ed were so concerned about the quality and the Integrity of doing business it really just was was an incredibly inspiring model that the two of you created so I just wanted to ask you what inspired you to start this company and kind of well I think I know what inspired you to start it the way that you did with that integrity and concern for Quality because that was something that was important to both of you but just like starting an herb business how did you fall into that we literally did fall into it um you know when and back when we were in Portland and in the Rainy Winters Ed was going down to the naturopathic College and he would lead all the old pharmac Capas and he was one of the earlier people to uncover those old pharmac Capas and all the wonderful herbal recipes they were just full of herbal recipes the phopas for those who don't know it's a government publication that's produced every 10 years that records recipes for all of the medicines that people would use and up until the early 1900s that was mostly filled with plants and then as Pharmaceuticals came into uh L and sted out so those early pharmas are just full of wonderful oral recipes so then when we moved to Southern Oregon it was really just out of passion and interest that started concocting you know some of these because when we looked at Oregon there were all these the plants that were you know especially Ed would making Sab at the time and he had been teaching about herbs he'd always been you know buying herbs delivered or in herb stores but he'd never really been around the live plants so that was such an inspiration so we started picturing everything that we could find they just out of passion as as people do and then when ased te who would take some of these as examples on the road with him just to show people you know this is what an eonia tinure is like this is what plant te like and then people wanted them so he came home and and we started you know went from pint jars to Port jars to gallon jars and he would take them back on the road with him and he had a little uh like a Jeep and he would open up the back of the Jeep and like the old medicine shows of old really and he would Bell share you know these these medicines so it literally grew very organically out of people wanting them and US enjoying making them loving making the extract being with the plants it was pure joy really to drove the whole thing that's so awesome Sarah I love hearing those stories you know I remember one time I used to bring the herb School there'd be like 35 students we put them on our bus that beautiful little bus that we used to drive around and do these wonderful trips all around the United States and I remember we would always come up several times we would bring them up to her farm and I one of the early trips I remember you were still running the business out of of your home you'd start it in your home and then you at that point you'd taken the garage and converted it we were all so impressed with the big bats and stuff in the in the garage you know but it was so incredible to see and I think at that time you'd finally gotten like a couple of helpers to go out help you harvest the plants and dry them and stuff yeah yeah we had the the business was in our house for at least 10 years and the time that we finally built a building decided we had a business and we needed to get it out of the house because our neighbors were starting to get a little concerned about we had 10 people coming to work in our 2,000 foot house that we also were living in for during that time yeah we had barrels of herbs in our bedroom yeah it was it was it was our life as it is for every herbalist right yeah so true yeah so we had the honor of working together at United plants saers during those first few years when it was just being initiated but I know for both of us those were really very special times and you were also president of the organization for over 10 years and again those were the really formative years you know and it took a lot of work to just even get this organization formed and so I just was wondering if you would just share a little bit about your role how you feel the role of UPS has served in American herbalism and you know any stories about those days that you want to share if there's a story or two that pops up about those early days with UPS yeah I think it was in the early 90s and you and some herbalists had gotten together at the international herb Symposium and were just you know recognizing this issue of the lessening populations of wild medicinal plants and you know and decided to do something about it and so you know that's that's for United PL Sabers I think the generation of the idea started but back in Oregon and of course we didn't have internet in those days so communication was a little bit less instant but meanwhile simultaneously while you were noticing on the East Coast the um shrinking populations of wild plants when you go out and look for them at Earth Farm we were about 12 years into maybe almost yeah about 15 years into our business by then and we were noticing because know getting golden seal and black Kash and blue Kash and Colonius and all those wonderful herbs from wonderful Pickers you know individuals we we never did buy them from the big wholesalers oh even those those people who were going out they were having trouble finding the plants they were getting smaller and of of course that was reflected in you know skyrocketing prices which was is appropriate but that was also reflecting the shrinking populations when we heard about this group that was starting to take action about that you know of course we we jumped on board because we saw from our perspective the problem was really clear I think Rich check who was working on manufacturing at the time he was you know in charge of the making of the extracts and he was also the one who was buying the extracts so he joined the board we you know we sent him to the United plan favers board and he was on there for a few years and then going because we one the part of this effort always I mean it was it spoke so much to the heart of everything that we were doing and you know felt like we were close to the the center of the issue and wanted to do what we could to help I think my first meeting was I went to a meeting in Hawaii we had the most extraordinary board meetings it was very easy to join that board because it was just so much fun right we we had board meetings in Hawaii and Mexico and Austin you know we went all around the United States doing doing board meetings and also at the time trying to educate people about the issue was and so we would thow have these conferences we were working yeah we were working we had a lot of fun working but um yeah uh and United plant Sabers I mean it's incredible to see what's going on with United plant Sabers today I mean that we're talking this been going on 30 years yeah it's really amazing to see how organization has touched the heart of so many herbalists I think United plant saers and I've heard refer to this way as being the heart of herbalism because I think that what United PL saers awoke in people was not only that the herb populations were um starting to be threatened but that the herbs needed us to be taking care of them and it was our call to all of us were we were as younger BLS the Holy Grail was the wild plant we were I know many of us very caught up in the idea that the best medicine was in the wild and I don't even doubt that might even be true but it doesn't mean that we can just take take take from the wild endlessly especially as herbalism flourish and grew and multiplied every year as it has and it's wonderful that herbalism in almost every home in the world these days but that does take its toll on the populations of wild plants so I think that herbalis that United plant Savers does speak to that heart of giving back to the plants and not just the plants taking care of us but us taking care of them and yeah that's that was just a wonderful calling and it's still true and it's being carried on in the most beautiful and flourishing ways which makes you and I both and many people so happy to to see that mission flourishing and and staying current with what today's issues are yeah so true Sarah I think we have to give a lot of credit to our current executive director we've had some wonderful executive directors for UPS who have really stepped up our first one being Richard leedman who's the one who organized all those amazing board meetings all over the United States and Mexico which I do want to really assure everybody we had to pay our own way pay for it all but it was so worth it because it made us like we we would have so much fun together so we built a community of the board members and then we were able to do so much work because of it and then we had our wonderful Linda LOL who brought when we were having such a hard time she just was able to bring us all back together and then the incredible and amazing Susan Leopold who I want to just really shout out for because she is just so impassioned by the mission and also just driven when she has all that young fire that's just in brilliant yeah yeah is amazing and I think it's true for Herb Farm and United plant Savers and probably every organization that the successes by the people that are called to serve in that organization and United plant Savers definitely the right people you know it's amazing who shows up at at at the times that are needed and um you know Richard absolutely was foundational Linda was transformational and healing for the organization at the time and and Susan has the vision and fire and passion that's totally taking United PL Savers to new new Realms International Realms being very effective the forest you know growing growing wild plants in the forest very instrumental in that whole movement um and the center for medicinal plants you know that that Sanctuary is in Ohio and I would say to anybody who's listening to this who has not made it to butland Ohio to the United PL sish Sanctuary it'll be a great treat for you to go there it's it's one of the most magical herbal meccas on the planet where it's you know the the wood Woods there are teaming with golden seal and jining and black cohash and it's it's a temple it is an absolute Temple Susan has made that very difficult in the world place to get to a destination yes right I mean there there's all kinds of events and classes happening there hiking the trails you can go there and stay in various places now it's [Music] a you know we have our own d& over there so it's you know really great how she has brought that Sanctuary to life and made it so available to so many people because it's such a special place yeah thank you Sarah so much I have to say I think I think that UPS Sanctuary is a 350 Acre Farm I think it's one of our great contributions my our generation's contributions to American herbalism and future herbalism we actually have established this amazing Sanctuary that's for all plant lovers and it's just amazing but yeah you know I always like to tell the story of how actually how UPS got its name United plant saers this was even before you joined the board Sarah this was in the very very early days when we were you know the first or second meeting when we were trying to find a name and I just suggest that we should call it UPS you know we'll plant anywhere but it was based on and I told the story then that early in the early days when you and Ed used to go around to the herb conferences you would have that display you had mentioned it where you'd show us what store-bought poorly dried poorly harvested eona chickweed or anything looked like you'd have a little display and then you would show us what it looks like when you're really growing high quality and and I remember this statement that you guys made it was we're all like a b bunch of UPS herbalists we think the plants grow on the UPS truck they arrive on it and they're shipped out on it when you used to say that it was like it was addressing this really big issue about herb quality which was a big issue for Our Generation right the current issues were not really about that they were about you know the survival of these plants so uh that was a little bit I was about how that got its name and did you know that it was the quality of herbs back in the 7s that was in the stores it was a lot of dried out brown material it wasn't the best I mean because herbalism was just waking up from a 40 years sleepy Hiatus got much attention right so when we moved to s Oregon and started seeing what these plants look like when you collect them fresh and and you know and get your hands on and so I think it was not only the it was the quality part of it that was so different you know when you collect herbs yourselves and grow them yourselves and dry them correctly and then there's also the part about it getting your hands on the herbs and not just not just going into the herb store and and buying them and not just you know ordering them through the male you know UPS or whatever but actually getting your hands on the plant having that firsthand experience of touching live plants and and working with the plants so I think that um that's another side of that topic yeah I always thought that was really sweet that you uh credited us with inspiring that name I'm glad we have a little p to distinguish United plant Sabers from the other one they couldn't be more different organizations but I think PL saers has has uh made its name in its own right and is its own ups for sure you know there's been a few times when the different board members have wanted to change the name because they said they say it sounds like much too like you know Tree Huggers or whatever and I always say well we are tree huggers but I've always argued to keep the name because it was named for a reason you know it really I think that when people know that reason it it kind of really gives it meaning you know so I wanted to also talk you've been very involved in another organization called Opa or the American Products Association and it's a it also plays an incredibly important role in American herbs and our products but a lot of people don't really know about it so I I was just hoping that because I think you served on its board of directors as well right for a number I did I did yeah the American earthlies Association is a very important organization to all herbalists whether they know it or not because it's really due to the amazing work of American orli Association that we still have access to a lot of the herbs that we do that organization is all these plant loving people who are willing to go head to toe with FDA talk to them in their language about and you know and also with their own language and about the the issues and how important that herbs are to people and you know was back in in 94 when desay the dietary supplement health and Education Act passed and you know opa which is you know it was instrumental I mean they were the ones that drove that law through and at the time there was a campaign to the populace you know letting people know that you know the that the FDA is threatening to make all many many all herbs unavailable to people unavailable yeah I don't think people really know remember what daa was about you know D it was really serious and so you know the the amazing people at apaa they they passed the dietary supplement health and Education Act which enshrined that herbs are available to people and and what I want to say though is that they did a writing campaign and what I heard was more people wrote in about that than any other issu that day which really showed the FDA how important it is to people to have access to their own health care and medicinal plants that have served humans for up until that day I mean always and into the future and and in many places in the world they're primary soures medicine I think that for um for small companies I mean ala represents small companies there are a lot of um owners or representatives from very small companies that are on the OPA board they've always made a point of making a space and having you know not just not just one smallb company but having a good percentage of that voice um represent so it's a very important organization a very dedicated hardworking smart people yeah thank you honey I feel the same you know and also we were so fortunate on the board of United plant Savers we had Michael mcduffin who was also the president of opa and just I don't think I've ever really known anyone who has you know given his entire life to making sure that herbs remain available he's just another remarkable individual I'm going to have to interview him for this series yeah Michael is amazing and he's one of those people that can put on a suit and talk to anybody in the government and go on 60 Minutes and at the same time there's nothing I think that makes him prouder than the empty lot across the street from his house in Santa Monica where he started a garden community garden yeah yeah community garden and I mean he would always come to the plant saers board meetings Pro with plants and produce from from his garden and he's still on the United plant saers board which I think is is really wonderful it's I think it's wonderful for he's still president of opa and I think that him having that sense of what's going on with the United plant Savers and bringing that to apaa and also having the awareness of what's going on in the government and Regulatory side of things and being able to bring that to United PL saers so he's an amazing liaison who uh wears many hats and wears them well it's so true I'm laughing because I I always used to tease him I used to say that he joined United PL saers in the very beginning I'm talking about this is the early 90s right because he was really worried about the what the organization was intent on doing with the industry right but the only way you know it was interesting like working with a group of people because it it really helped to also broaden the way I thought because I would I wasn't looking at you know we have to really involve The herbal industry that they it's very essential that we get their support and work with them in order to make the mission of UPS successful right because it was all those and Michael knew that right from the beginning in order for UPS to really make a difference with what was going on with the over harvesting the companies had to be engaged and they had to understand and also UPS had to understand what was going on with the herb business so he he served a very pivotal role I think for both for both Opa and then also for United plant saers so yeah shout out for Michael McGuffin again he's another person Works kind of quietly behind the scenes you know but yeah incredible yeah yeah yeah so I want to talk about the plants a little bit and just ask if you have a story to tell about I don't know about a a moment in your life when you felt like you had a real aha moment with the plants or you know I know for many of us that was like you mentioned this early on it was a calling and for some of us we feel like they actually saved Our Lives both maybe sometimes physically or metaphorically but if you just have one of those stories to share I'd love the he well I do of course I do all of us do right I mean that's part of what God has hooked in I think you know one of the earliest herbal healings amazing healing moments I remember was when I was in Portland and I was riding my bicycle and I had an accident and I went off the curb and my my break came loose and like a pendulum hit me the eye and I got got knocked out and you know just big black eye my eye was okay but somebody gave me some homeopathic ARA and it was amazing I mean you know I that was I think that was probably my first really um amazing or because by the next morning my eye was completely different it was so amazing and that so that and then later on when we Mo to Southern Oregon um I and a more uh indepth Herbal Healing I I ended up with um PB pelvic inflammatory disease oh I remember which was really quite serious I was in the hospital in Grant past and they wanted to do a Hy me and that was you know in my 20s and that horrible and so I I didn't you know I said no and they made me s in no way because I had an absence I accet on my ovary and That Could That Could burst and had I been smarter then as you know if I knew as much then as I did now realized that that was I could have if it bir I would have had septicemia which could have been very serious and we lived you know 45 minutes from town but I didn't know to be worried about that so I we checked myself out and we went home and I was on a program for a couple of months of lots of herbs lots of eonia I was doing Sith baths a lot of nature cure so many you know so many Herbal Remedies I was doing C oil CS religiously rubbing various you know herbs on taking so many herbs internally and I would go back to the gynecologist every week or so he wanted to check on me to make sure I was okay after a couple when he's feeling around and feeling around they said well I think you saved yourself an operation wow yeah and so and I think what I learned from that was that when you're dealing with something serious to throw everything that you can thinkink up at it you know I mean everything good right you know I mean using using herbs using every bit of nature cure that you can think of I got some water that umle had blessed and I drank that I don't know that any one herb or any one you know thing that I did was what really I think it's a combination and I what I always say to people is do everything good that you can think of because you know it's added to with cumulative I would also say that every time I've had any kind of health problem the herbs have always taken care of it it's sort have been amazing I remember once having the most awful eie and putting some St John's wart Mull oil in my ear yeah and instant relief was miraculous it's miraculous isn't it yeah so um you know it wasn't any stretch to understand that her work and how herbs work you know I mean and I think so many of us were were pulled in by our own health concerns and issues and and thank goodness that we had them that you know that they let us down this this path that's been they rewarding for her own health and healing you know and and keeping us um off of pharmaceutical and then drawing us into this bigger world of of helping other people and and growing the understanding of the amazing magic ofal medicine boy that's incredible you know Sarah when you were talking right then I was just thinking oh my God you you and aded must have gotten just unbelievable amounts of letters and emails and stories from people who have used the thousands and thousands of herbal products that you put out there in the world I mean you must have a did you ever keep any of those stories I mean it must be just an amazing amount of testimonials for the plants and how well they've worked yeah certainly although all anything that was written you know we've archived for sure and yeah it's pretty great feeling to uh to hear from people about their successes using herbal medicine you know I mean we we keep learning from other people's experience experiences too there's no endgame in the herb world right there there's no there's no there where you you know you finally got it there's always more to learn there's always more plants to to learn about um although I have to say my favorites have always been the local plants around us but yeah I mean people have had amazing experiences with herbs and we love hearing about them it's been you know for a long time I answered the phone when they would call and ask about Earth back in the day you actually could tell people oh yeah and you could say oh I I know what you should do for that and so uh definitely spoke to a lot of people who were using using our products heard their stories and using other products you know you were mentioning that some of your favorite plants of course the things that grow locally do you have any particular plant allies or special plants that always show up for you well yes um the plant that probably comes to my mind when you when you ask that question most brightly is hypericum than I'm a multi-b lover for sure and it's I love them all but St johnp has spoken to me for a long time and and in many ways first of all it grows abundantly in southern Oregon yeah I mean so much so that they introduced the beetle to help to wipe it out uh so now when we go to collector we have to raise the deals for the for the flowers but I collected millions and millions of St John's W flowers loved harvesting St John's w we grew in in most in the mountains it grew in in Meadows um I loved picking those flowers and seeing that red oh inside that would come out and and you know just just be so magical and the flowers are so beautiful with those little cute little stamms all those sparkly little STS that stand up holding those little leaves with their little perforations that's why it's called hyper perum we all know that they hold those little leaves the light and see the light come through mag so those are on a morphological level but then as far as it's medicinal properties you know for for pain I say from that earache I mean I would never go anywhere without having my St John's o with me you know I met a wonderful little St John anecdote was Ed and I were in um thailands and he had banged into something it was a kind of a bad bruise and he had put St John's oil on his bruise and then you for was doing it for several days and we noticed he out his son and he and he got burned one day he was out in the sun too much but the place where he put the St John's were oil did not burn so I it's it's also a wonderful sun protector yeah learn that about it which is interesting too because they say that if cows eat St John's bort in the field they will their hair sometimes will fall out this photo phototoxicity but on on humans it seems to be photoprotective you love St John I mean I love every every plant I've ever touched so that's one that that comes to mind Mullen again you know I go and you know pick so many of those little Mullen flowers I mean when you spend so much time when you collect plants and you spend so much time intimately you know just speak to them and you know collecting their what they're giving you and and and then using those plants you know for for soothing for whether it's being for intestines or sore throat or ears I mean Mullen is it's so soft the leaves are soft we all joke about it being you know one of the great wild toilet papers and it is um Can can be a little itchy if you leaving on there too long but um yeah do love Mullen but yeah I up to a lot of wild plants another plant that I love a lot and again because I collected a lot of it is milk thisle oh wow yeah milk thisle grows on the Oregon coast and I would go out there I remember I used to go out with with food of kids and and we go out there and just drive along the Oregon coast those beautiful blocks or find these fields you know farmer fields that had were covered in in uh in milk thistle and knock on the door and say would you mind if we would you know pick your pick the milk thistle and they'd be like go ahead please do you weed you know take it off yeah and I would love to PO milk feed and and Munch on them you know besides being good for your liver they were also really tasty so we would we would post milk seeds and add them to a lot usually when people have to harvest milk this so they don't love it you know just because it's like one of the hardest things the seeds are so hard to harvest well you know for some reason I always love it and I I love um collecting Nettles also which is another one of my completely favorite herbs I mean in the wild you know we grow Nettles now we grow so many of of these herbs now but um I I used to lovey nett with my bare hands and feeling that tingly feeling it felt so healing mean it was a little annoying but mostly it somebody told me it was really good for me so so do it and and today I still love collecting blackberries and and just diving into those blackberry bushes so I don't mind being prickled I guess is what it is yeah especially when you get such yummies from it I love listening to you talk about the plants Sarah you actually when all herbalist they get kind of this cuning sound in their voice you know you feel all this love coming out of them like every time you mention this PL a plant it's like you're telling a love story it's really beautiful to hear it so you know I want to ask you if there's one or two teachers actually like you know any of the elders or any of the teachers or a person that really influenced your herbal work that you wouldn't mind just sharing about telling a story you know I I mentioned Gabriel and you know it's worth mentioning again because he say you know I give him a lot of credit for turning me onto the spirit in the plants wow is very connected to plant spirit and also gardening and getting my hands in the ground and and learning how to caress seeds and and plants and of course Ed Smith oh you know I mean he was you know he had a way of speaking about how does guys he still with it speaking about how plants work in the body in his you know the actual metabolic actions that plants have that I maybe because I had been in chiropractice school and I was well versed in anatomy and physiology and so when he when he would speak about those plant actions in the body that spoke deeply to me I understood that and excited me a lot and another um you know a lot these people they're Elders today they weren't Elders then right but another another person who was a contemporary at the time and Elder now is Christopher Hobs you know we we spent a lot of time I spent a lot of time with Christopher in in the mountains botanizing and you know I'm so grateful for all of all of the botanizing that I learned I mean I was I was it made me pay attention to plants I didn't know and that that was that was really a great gift um besides and you know getting you know knowing how to identify the plants that I wanted know but also discovering new plants discovering just those teeny little plants that that often were so easy to overlook but to stop and who are you and get out my little microscope and I would H with this the big heavy pitch this big heavy hardbound um you know floras that went into great detail but I really appreciated um all of the botney and you know and and and medical use I mean Christopher is a great herbalist and well understands how herb used and acupunctur and so many things but so um those were you know and and you of course you know going to all of the events that you were putting on when and you know inspired so much love and understanding and and and also I think I you know I would you know credit with you helping me to really appreciate the simple backyard plants that are around us you've always really pointed out the value it's such a such a temptation to you look for the Exotic and the next covered herb and you know we have such abundance around us already you really you know barely need another plant and other than what we already have around us and you know who else is is Cascade OH Anderson Geller I met Cascade quite early on when I was living in Portland and at that time the first herbalist I knew was at you know and and he was fascinating he knew so much and you know and I I took it all in and I remember then when I met Cascade and I was like oh there's a whole other way to look at her I mean she had such um contradictory I or you know complimentary contradictory ideas you know yeah she did opened my mind to so much you know but especially that um there are lots of different ways to look at Earth and a lot of different approaches and and that they're all valid we're all different the herbs are all different and there's just you know pay attention to a lot of different oralists thank you so much you just you know it's so nice to hear these names like Gabriel and Cascade are these Elders who as you really so wisely pointed out we were all just young together we were meeting each other when we were in our 20s you know and kind of growing up together but I think just even when I think about them and it's the importance of like capturing these stories because you know so many of our of our contemporaries have passed on you know and I know as we're that age whereas we're getting older we're in our 70s and 80s and we'll just see more of that so just having I I just feel like putting this collection together of just these herble stories and of course many of these people have written books Cascade didn't write a book but her family her husband and children have collected and Beth our good friend Beth have collected her all of her teachings really you know that were written and a lot of her lectures and are are actually creating a book which will be such a great gift for for you know anybody interested in plants and you know as you mentioned even more than just plants it was her Wise Way of being in the world such a powerful teaching for so many people yeah yeah really good excited about that book project be so good yeah sort of coming to the end of our time but I had a couple more things you know I know when when all of us were first starting our herbal work in the 1970s and 1980s and we looked back and it was such an exciting creative just vibrant time for us but there was also a lot of challenges that we were facing as herbalists you know just things that we mentioned some like you know getting good quality plants for instance so do you mind like what did you find was really challenging when you were first starting your herbal work what were the challenges that were kind of facing herbalists at that time or you personally whichever I think I wasn't aware of the challenge at the time you know it all seemed like such a blessing and a gift that at the time I don't think you know I was just it was a time of Discovery and passion and amazement so when I look back on it more you know I I look up now I I can realize that we were challenged by we weren't as connected as we are now in in a lot of ways you know so we had to travel a little further to find each other and to get the teachings there wasn't the abundance of information available you know online the great a huge amount of books but you know there was something also very simple and unchallenging about that smaller world you know and you know having the John ler book and M Greaves and you know a few books that we did have and the people that we did know that we paid so much attention to yeah so I I really don't look back at any of it as being all that challenging for me the bigger challenge became as the business grew it became more business than it did herbal oh yeah and then it was it really wasn't my area you know it really wasn't where I you know I mean I I showed up for it the best that I could but the people that showed up to take over from there who I I learned so much made me realize how challenged I was in what I was trying to do but I think that and and maybe it's just my outlook on life in general I don't know but I think I see opportunities more than I see challenge that's so beautiful that's a gift yeah it the it has been a gift you know I see this whole journey as a life gift and I I'm just overwhelmed with gratitude for for the path that that has chosen me and you know that I was um lucky enough to walk on May maybe for purists today they might have challenges that are certainly different than what we face and again I think that they're opportunities as much as their challenges some of the herbs that we thought were in great abundance like false unicorn you know which a lot of you know herbalist used to help women with who are you know pregnant and child birth and we we we don't use that today you know so there's there's a challenge in in in finding new herbs but it's also an opportunity because there are so many wonderful herbs that are out there and so much research that is going on into herbs I would say what the CH the challenges for today is just how overwhelming the amount of information is you know and again you know it's opportunity but it's but it's challenge really challenging yeah for us you know we just I mean we BL down the way whatever we could could get and we just miled it for everything we could you know because it was all so wonderful and juicy so you know it is a different time today so many plants to choose from too I think you know I think it's you know I mean we were probably concentrating on 20 or 30 plants you know that we that we paid attention to and that we work with and and we you know we learned to use and and and today you know I mean there's hundreds of of plants out there and it's it's it's fabulous it's it's stimulating and it's confusing could be so it's a lot to sort out you know and then there there's such a richness of of teachings out there today too I mean you know it's you can you can get lost in in it all it's wonderful it's a wonderful place to get lost I love just listening to you talk Sarah because everything that could be challenging for some people you immediately you look at it and you identify it but you immediately change it into that blessing again you know and how fortunate for all of us really all of us who love herbs that you and Ed created such an incredible business and that you've just really devoted your life and done so much for herbs and herbalism really I mean we only touched on a very small amount of what you've done but it's really been remarkable both I think on a national and and very local level like you're very an active part of your local community but and nationally but internationally as well you've had such an impact so hone what do you think has been like not I guess I could ask this two ways you know what do you feel your greatest contribution is but more I think I want to ask you what of all the things that you've done in the herbal world what has brought you the most Joy what do you just you know happi about that you've accomplished in all this all these years oh that's a great question well you know I I would say you know the the most rewarding part for me has been the work with United plan saers Herb Farm was fun because we were making medicines and talking to people and seeing how people were benefiting from using heral medicines I I I loved all of that part but getting called into the the nonprofit part of the herb world you don't have those business concerns different business concerns because it still is you know it still is a business you still need to raise funds but the the pure dedication of everybody who was in involved with United plant States was so incredibly inspiring and you know I want to you know I want to add to your point that you were mentioning how when we had all of our fabulous board meetings they were all on our own dime you know that I want people who who support United PL states to know it's really one of the best organizations you can support where every dollar does go towards the work I think that what's most rewarding to me at this juncture is to look both at Herb Farm and United plant saver and see how the work that we've put in is being carried on how the V the original Visions are still being taken forth and and expanded and and brought current and touching more people than ever before and so it's it's very rewarding to me in these gold and silver years to look back at that to you know to and to feel glad to both still be part of both of those organizations as well you know not have not having to run them but to to cheer them on and and support them and I'm really grateful for for for the this time of life and for the great people that have shown up I think it's just it's just so important to appreciate the people that have shown up along the way and in in both of these Journeys and who have taken these visions and decided to make them their own own and are caught up in this in the spirit and the magic of the Plant World so um it's it's it's really very gratifying at this juncture to uh to be more in the background and and still and still feel like I can poke a little bit here and there and and and add my my little bit of help or it's needed I appreciate also that I can still feel a little bit of use in both of those places so you so you're involved a lot more than you know yeah thank you so much Sarah it's just so wonderful to just spend this time with you and you know even I think I think I've known you for like over 40 years maybe 45 years maybe 50 years I mean I can't remember the very first time but it's been I think it is actually been over 50 years but I still learned so much listening to you and there's parts of that story that you know especially when you first um went to Oregon that was all so nice to hear so thank you so much for all the work you've done for plants and for plant lovers and you know really for all the incredible medicines I I mean someday you and Ed should figure out how many gallons and gallons of herbal medicine you have sent out into the world and also you know one thing I think it's important to to Really state is that very early on both of you decided to be growing a lot of the medicin that you are using in your products so so the Gardens at Herb Farm and the incredible gardeners and Farmers that you've supported you know we didn't even touch on that but you helped so many herb Farmers really get going with their with their farming work to provide incredibly organic plants for this country so I really want to thank you so much for all that you've done and just mostly for being one of my dear friends I love you so much thank you thank you Mary this has been so special and I'm so honored to be part of this and and to have this time with you has been extremely special and always will be I am thankful to be here I am thankful to be [Music] here
