hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant and healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do I of a bird and I can feel the I know that I'm part of the earth when I see the sunrise I am thankful to be here I am thankful to be here Brook I've heard you refer to yourself as a guyan citizen and a sacred ecologist I I think I know what you mean by that but I'd really love to hear you share about that what what those words mean to you well as far as being a good guy and citizen um I like to refer to this beautiful Earth as Lady Gaia I believe she's moving into a whole new level of possibility these days and that's a wonderful way to address her yeah and um actually I really came to work for the Earth uh even more than just human beings I work with human beings because uh we seem to be a really key player in this game that's going on right now and uh also one of the wonderful things is I've been able to travel a lot lately and I have been able to circle the globe and see a lot of the earth and the Earth's people so uh that's another way I think of myself as a guy in Citizen and as far as earthkeeper again I came to work for the Earth and for all our relations as much as human beings you know White Buffalo Woman talks to us about valuing um you know everybody in the circle of life everything and everyone uh as much as we value ourselves and I certainly stand in that place so um I'm really concerned about the family of life you know and and about our human family because as you know we are now in the sixth great Extinction on this planet yeah and primarily because of we humans uh we have lost over 50% destroyed I might say over 50% of our Earth family 50% of our Earth family of the species the beings yeah who are our family here on Earth we have actually destroyed and so I'm very very concerned about all of our relations and about our human uh ability to stay here because you know if I were a good mother and uh one of my children had killed half of the family I would have to say you need to go yeah and so um you know being an earthkeeper all of those things are on my mind and and certainly on my heart and I have very deep sadness about what we've done to this incredibly rely beautiful Earth that we were given so I I'd like to to keep this Earth beautiful I would like to see a regenerative sustainability happening and that really has to come from us as a human family so I'm definitely uh an earthkeeper from my heart I I fell in love with the earth when I was a child you know I've I've been around crazy human beings for a lot of my life for most of my life and uh so what I turn to I think as many people who get into the Plant World um you know suddenly realize that there are these other amazing beings other than human beings around and uh so turning to the land turning to uh the beauty of the land and the Animals was the way I began my life yeah Brook I I know I've heard a little bit from you of your childhood but I would love it if you just share a little bit because you know it's rare that somebody feels their calling at such a young age and just because you've been doing this work since you were just a young woman so yeah would you just share a little bit about your childhood and what brought you into this way of living well I was raised on a self-sufficient Homestead on the back country of the crow reservation in Montana and it was absolutely a wonderful place I said to to my mother once when I was little I said to her mom you know this is heaven in in real heaven the animals aren't afraid of us yeah and so I really had that sense that it was just this radiant radiant amazing place it really touches my heart to think about this and the thing that was challenging was the you know my family was Native American and uh all of the challenges that came to Native American people in that time including from my family alcoholism and so there was a lot of craziness and violence and unhappiness and dysfunction in our our system and I often uh you know just completely turned you know I'd get on a little horse and and ride up into the you know on the deer Trails up into the High Country and uh spend my time outside as much as I could and I just really at that time you know just so much fell in love with the beauty the exquisite exquisite beauty and there were in that beautiful country uh there were Pure Springs still are pure Springs of water coming out of the ground down from these Crystal mountains that there's a white quartz crystal underneath the the mountains that are traditional looking you know just Pine covered mountains but there was this incredibly pure water and there was such beauty and it really could have remained Heaven had it not been for the dysfunction of our family oh yeah I that's one thing I've always loved about YouTu B is that you you know you're this amazing ceremon this absolutely gorgeous woman and you're just a cowboy too you know you you've oftentimes lived on ranches you know and you ride horses and I just love that it's just that kind of Duality there that you embrace it's so beautiful I'm I'm a cowgirl Indian you know and what's fascinating to me is one of the things in my my traditional name is that I'm the my helpers are the Sun and the Moon and from me that's a statement of that um like I'm an artist I'm a business person I'm a you know I'm a Rancher I'm a Indian I'm a you know so many things I have sides to me so I get a kick out of that it's challenging it its own way but that seems to be a part of my medicine as it were it's powerful medicine Brook really you know I know that um ceremony I think one of the things there's so much about when you stand in circle and you just let the Earth speak through you um your way of doing ceremony I remember one time years ago our beloved Steven buer who's one of our elders who passed away fairly recently but he used to say I heard him say this you know he'd be talking to me and he said nobody nobody knows how to hold a circle like just to hold all the energy of all those different people in ceremony better than Brooke it's like when she steps into the circle it's almost like you see the trees bend over to list listen to her you hear see the flowers listening to her and of course all of of us in the circle are opening our hearts so I'm just wondering how did cere it doesn't sound like your parents really taught you a lot about ceremony so where did or maybe they did but where where and when did you first start doing ceremony in your life well golly yeah I didn't I didn't have many traditional teachings when I was a child even though we were half breed ranchers and thus not so connected to the more traditional people on the reservation but at the same time uh so much of the Native ways were broken you know when I was a child native ceremony was illegal Federal defense illegal so we didn't have a lot of we had to hide in the back country and we were so far out you know we often just had horses to ride and not cars so we didn't get to many things so I didn't get very much from my Crow tribe and my elders that have been would have been there which was often really sad for me but what seemed to happen again and again and again in my life even when I found a teacher who was my first teacher was a Cheyenne woman um it seemed that like turning me over to the Earth turning me over to Spirit was more what happened than turning me over to Elders who taught me so specifically about things so in a way I feel like unlike many of us in this culture uh who have just had to wing it in a way and so when I went out to uh study for my PhD in San Francisco in the 70s uh it was Carlos castan time and and you know hippie time and all this interest in in Native ways and all of that and an interest in taking care of the earth I think and I was as eager a learner as everyone else you know I was just so excited about things and people realizing that I had a native background turned to me for ceremony and I'm going who me it's like M it's like I didn't really you know I hadn't been taught that much um but anyway I just somehow you know I think a lot of us who came in this time around I know you for sure Rosemary and a lot of us came in as old souls you know we we as I was teasing a little earlier this is not my first rodeo and uh and I think that for a lot of us on Earth you know I mean it's clear that we've been here before and that we're dedicated to taking care of the earth and the land and that some how we come in with some support from our past lives and I don't know if that's what helped I just did the best I could do and and I'm I'm a good sensible person to figure out all of these things and I'm also a good learner I really paid attention and learned as much as I could and and just did the best I could and and I feel like what I still do is very simple in a way but it's just holding that space and realizing that that you know the gestures we make the the prayers we make especially esally when we come together in circle are very very powerful so no matter what you know just wanting to do that wanting to offer people the opportunity to do that and to find the incredible power of that is is how I've stepped into it and I feel like I'm still learning for sure I know you've always been such a great learner I know every time you go to conferences and Retreats and stuff and you're a teacher there but you always go to everybody else's classes I always thought that was so wonderful I was too busy visiting right and chatting and talk well and organizing too that was part of it but yeah that's pretty amazing I also think you know I think one of the things that I do totally agree with you I think we came in as old souls and we had ancestors that were speaking loudly to us but also you know you just opened your heart to the Earth and I think we also knew how to hear the Earth it was almost like the Earth is teaching you you know how to how to step forth and hold energy you know because I you know I was mentioning this earlier but that was definitely one thing that I always saw with you always every time I've stood in Sacred Circle with you is you know you are just opening yourself to the Earth and she pours through you and then you're like the condent to bring it out to the world and up into the heavens so you're like the trees really you know you're you stand between the Earth and the heavens and just channel that and it's I mean it actually really moves me to even talk about it because I've seen you do it so much so often in so many incredible ways yeah it's kind of amazing so you know one of the things that I think that you brought forth into the modern world right now that we live in and you're one of the teachers for that is walking the beauty way and you have incredible songs about the beauty way and it's been you know like even the way you dress and the beads that you do you know that fine beading and everything so would you just share a little bit about walking you know what Walking The Beauty Way means and maybe even even if you can in in words share what we can do in a simple way to walk the beauty way more every day I think the the first thing for me is paying attention to the life around us and I know people live in you know don't live in the beauty of nature but the thing that I think we can look at for inspiration is the absolute beauty of this Earth You know that if we just pay attention it is so Exquisite so and also my sense is that beauty opens us to Spirit it's like um a teacher of mine from the south said one time uh in the face of every flower or through I think he said through the face of every flower Spirit speaks and and that that sense of beauty when we're moved by Beauty I feel like we're moved toward spirit and so uh you know it's about being moved toward spirit and it's also about uh and I have one song that says we plant flowers as we walk we're walking this beauty way and not only are we seeing the flowers and the beauty but it's our our duty to to make Beauty and it's not false Beauty you know it's not um adding something or um you know what we think of as you know putting a lot of makeup on it's really about finding the beauty inside ourselves and I think as we find a a natural path where even our own Beauty and our own personal Beauty can shine forth from that natural the good healthy food we eat and being out and exercising and drinking good water and all of that so that our natural beauty shines and we're also really supporting the the natural beauty of the Earth itself so walking that beauty way is uh um you know the Novelo people say I walk with beauty before me Beauty behind me Beauty on my left and Beauty on my right Beauty my old age I walk and so that thought even is just a powerful one that is so beautiful yeah I I so agree with you Brooke you know it's like this world is the most exquisitely beautiful place that anyone could ever imagine and it has it has everything it needs to make every human being and every animal being and every insect being every one of us it provides so much so it's a wonder that humans have not found a way to be at peace with it you know we are so disconnected from our mother the Earth it's just tragic and you know I agreed when you were first talking about you know that if you were a mother and one of your children was so misbehaving that it was destroying the life of the whole family that you would have to look at a way of you know punishing it really but I also think that we as mothers you know we would always have hope that something would change right that is one of our jobs is to carry that hope that we can really change that child you know Humanity being the children to me it's not so much about punishment in that sense but it's really about saying you know it's about a learning process it's like it's natural consequences I believe that in rearing children natural consequences is the way to rear them if you do something harmful then what what is the consequence of that for you and for and to help people see what's happening because I think a lot of people don't understand uh you know what were doing I mean one of the interesting things when I teach I teach a lot about what white bu CF pipe woman shared and the the early part of her story is that two men approached her when she came to the Lakota people two men approached her and one of those men approached her in lust because she was a beauty you know she was a radiant Beauty in lust and um you know want greed he wanted something for himself and uh she disappeared him actually and then another man a true man uh what we consider a true man who not only had his masculine possibilities but also the feminine sense of taking care of the people he he works for the people and so this one stood up and said will you come and teach my people even though he could have been disappeared as well I guess but he was the kind of man that was took courage and stood up so when I tell that story I know that most all of us go well I'm the good guy or I'm I'm the woman so I'm the I'm the good person in this story yeah I remind people that we're all a little bit of the bad guy because the United States and many Western countries you know we use 60 to 600 times as much we take from the earth and from Life way more than anyone else does and to me that's very much what that man was representing so for us to to wake up to what's what's possible and you know one of the things I've loved and why I think of myself in a sense going back to the Guan idea is I see so much Beauty in the way that things are done around the earth and I'm in Europe right now and I've always appreciated many things about Europe but one of them is that they haven't had as many resources as we have had you know there are a lot more people and there's not so much so they have learned to you know their appliances that work much better than ours you know just simple things like hanging our clothes out you know yeah that's standard I mean yeah instead of using electricity you know causing us to have to do whatever it is whether it's now coal being brought back for some bizarre reason or nuclear power or whatever it is you know if if everyone in America just stopped using those big dryers I think we would see an incredible reduction in what we need and what we're having to do to Dam up rivers and get hydroelectric and all of that so just simple things but we're so set in our ways it's like look we look down on those primitive folks who hang their clothes out yeah really place I had an interesting experience I mean I literally could have gone back to South America when I came home I came home and I had just a few little things to wash out and I had been in South America and I've been in Europe and even in England where it's like really rainy they hang you know they find a way to dry their clothes yeah so I came home and just washed out a few things and I said to the scal I'll just hang them out on the line you know just a few little tiny things and she had this really funny look and I said we don't have a line and she said oh no I don't have a line and I said well and she still had a funny look on her face and I said what's going on Susan and she said it's illegal to have a clothes line in this part of town and I tell you I was so sad and so heartbroken I could have just left and and gone back to where they hang their cloes out so it's that kind of thing you know it's very strange where we've gotten to but you know thankfully I mean I I want to get around to talking about plants too uh I'm so glad that that there are people like you I just admire you so much for uh and and I think maybe like me it was just kind of a natural expression you know you just your your family your grandmother your your people had that sense of using herbs and and it was just obvious and natural to bring them forward and you had the heart and the wisdom to to do that so you know those of us who have had that deeper connection you know I think we really need to step up in every way that we can and certainly herbalists and what herbalists are doing right now to me is is vitally important because it's one of the places herbal people and Farmers you know farmers markets and that kind of thing yeah it's one of the places where I feel like there's just this ding ding ding happening in the minds of our uh modern public our American public going oh wow oh wow and choosing to do those things rather than supporting uh you know the big farma that wants to uh sort of R the world and give us these strange things that actually many times don't work and often are very very harmful oh so harmful ecological disaster actually it's one of the things about modern medicine yeah I'm also hopeful because of the younger generation there are so many younger generation that are standing up for the Earth you know and really crying out and outrage so they give me a lot of hope you know they're they're activists out there like we were actually like there's a huge another wave of these young people that are very awake and inspired to make changes so so I know that you you mentioned um several different healers but is there one Healer that you can think of that influenced your work a lot who was a special teacher for you or a story you have to tell about a teacher it's so funny actually I have to say uh I have I I have several different stories maybe but one of the things I want to say uh and I know you're a little bashful Rosemary but you've been a really profound in uence for me you know to see your natural your just your natural love and expressing that and the the connection with the Earth and all that in the grounded you know sometimes I go I would just like to be an herbalist instead of just talking all the time you know or that kind of thing you know to get my hands in the ground is one of the things I would really love so much and that grounded you know hands in the ground doing it it right from scratch is one of my real um values and so you have really been a special teacher for me in that way and you know I haven't so much worked with herbs as like I don't prescribe herbs or I'm I'm not an herbalist but one of the things I said and I have been saying and interestingly enough it's kind of come true I said it laughingly but I really meant it said to people if and when the Earth really you know things go heck you know when we maybe don't have as much Supply or can't get what we need or whatever I'm going to kidnap and because to me that that's you know if you have that knowledge of food plants medicinal plants and all of that you're just way way way ahead in any situation you know this situation in this very moment uh or not so anyway what's kind of fun is that I have come here to France and I live with a very very good friend and she's an architect has really gotten very much interested she's you know 60 some years old and wanting change your life and get away from all of the stuff you know the politics of architecture and she's taking an absolutely amazing herbal course oh wow here in Monier France is just stunning not only do you study herbs specifically at every possible level but they T Homeopathy in a and Olo therapy and all of these kind of things so actually I kind of kidnapped one without even having to work hard on it and uh so uh you know I I just really am uh appreciative of all that and I got to be around so many wonderful earist when I was with you and in your conferences and stuff so I've really I have many plant friends that I use myself and uh I'm I'm getting to learn more on all of our walks but I wanted to share something kind of funny because when you would invite me to herbal Gatherings you invited me partly to do ceremony and all of that but I always felt a little bashful and sad that I didn't have something fur to offer so my teaching my teaching was often cayenne pepper I know and you know I would shock people by telling them all the way she can use cayenne pepper you know you can use it to or and one of the things I I've just been teaching literally it's the one thing I often teach people day to day to day in my life because or I will just ask them do you have cayenne pepper in your kitchen in case of of cuts or or bleeding or anything like that and they look at me funny and I go no it's the it is the finest thing I can have on hand to stop bleeding it form them I mean it stops bleeding boom just like that and it forms an amazing scabin it also has all of that ccor bringing wonderful energy and it's antibacterial and all of that so I would I would talk to people about cayenne which I think is a much um malign plant perhaps you know and I I used to I used to get mad at people because they'd say i' say you know what you cut yourself I've cut myself hit myself with a knife and cut it open and and I just grab the cayenne pepper and put on there and otherwise i' you know I'd bleed out a lot and people go well doesn't that s just wanna I just want to pop them it's like well just bleed to death then it's like if you don't want a little sting I guess that's too bad so anyway one of the fun things about Cayo is that it's not burning you it's just stimulating you and told them that I also uh have used it diluted beautifully and well and used appropriately but I used it in my eyes I've snorted it up and cleaned my sinuses with it and so I've I've done some amazing things and share with people but one of the things I share with them as well is that when you if you want to use it like I often use it at the beginning if I'm starting to get anything in my sinuses I I delete some liquid tincture and and snort that and the thing the thing I always tell them is that one the biggest challenge is if you have the guts to do the same not and and the other one is that but we're going to do a little dance there's a specific Cayenne dance that comes when you do dance so oh my that's that's one of my great friends is cayen and I literally used it in the last little while I have tore something up the other day and threw that Cayenne on and it's just healing so beautifully so it's still a great pal of night I love that work you've just Illustrated so many different things in this little talk that you just gave like one is that at herbalist you know you can know just a few herbs and when you learn them they like become like really good friends you can use them for for everything like you were just saying it's that plant Ally and then when you were talking about earlier when you first were mentioning living with this your kidnapping your herbal friend right it um it reminded me of something like with my grandmother you know in a very serious situation they my grandparents were survivors of the Armenian Genocide and if my grandmother was my first herbal teacher but the reason that they partly why they survived was because my grandmother knew about plants she was they were able to find food to eat and also to take care of all the illnesses that happened when they were you know running hiding and marching to their death so uh you know because my grandparents actually met on the Death March but my grandmother used to tell us when we were children it was her knowledge of the plants and her faith in God you know she had a very strong faith and she also was knowled knowable about how to use the plants and that's why they were able to survive when most of their family you know they were all scattered but most of them were actually killed so yeah I think it it it kind of that's a more sober illustration of that but it does speak about what you were saying and then I just want to say you know I always invited you to those herbal conferences because I saw you as a plant lover and as an herbalist because herbalism isn't just about you know using plants for medicine it's using plants you know loving plants and using them as a way of life which you've always done you know like you've always embraced plants as a way of life and so but I would all I have to be honest I would always laugh when I would see you put down you want to teach about cayenne and I'm going but I want her to do ceremony and sing about the plants but I would always put it down for you and they were great classes for certain yeah so um yeah you know just just carrying that a little further I mean you actually kind of shared this already like have you had AA moments with the plants like was there do you have any story of when the plants you really felt connected but I would say probably all of your Cayenne stories you felt pretty aha moments with them right no I have a couple other things that I think are are interesting like someone told me at one time I've had a bit of a challenge with my bronchials um just just seems like the lungs you know a little little challenge little challenging I get something in my head it seems to go down and challenge my bonkill and that's always been a real tough thing for me to deal with but I found out that I found a beautiful Mullen I would pick it in the spring the little tiny tiny Exquisite rabbit ear kind of leaves and and always keep it with me and I have it to this very day right in the Next Room there and I've used it in the last month uh I would just take one of those little rabit ear pieces of Mullen light it a fire and smoke you know let that smoke draw that smoke into my lungs and boom you can feel it I could feel it going to that bronchial especially the one that's more challenged I could feel it go and if I just do that two or three times going it stops that lung Challenge and if I don't stop it then it goes into something much more heavy so M has been just wonderful it's to me it's just like total magic like plants are but it's just the total magic of them and another story and it's not exactly herbal but it's homeopathic and I think of homeopathic it's you know it's arnica yeah and you know you make it out of plants as we do so much of our healing and I had an experience one time I was on the ranch in Montana and it was one of those days one of the things I love to do is on sunny days I would go out and just hang out with the horses and it was so Sunny this afternoon that all of were kind of sleepy and I was just leaning up against a big 16 hand racehorse that we had they dead race and we also had mules and these silly mules were always doing something so this one mule walked over where there was kind of a pile of boards and stepped on a board in it it went and wow everybody went right straight in the air and that big old horse jumped in the air and came down right his H came right down my shin oh boy yeah yeah painful and I remembered arnica and I made a run into the house and it was hurting bad I made a run the house I opened that arnica I probably jumped all B I just got some arnica in my body I didn't have arnica Saab because it was broken a little bit I wouldn't have used the S on it anyway but I put that arnica in on the pain was gone the pain was gone and I kept it up and it just didn't get to be a problem at all so it really really really made a difference and it was one of those moments you know where you go this St works yeah yeah I know so exciting so arica is still a good pal of mine as our many of the homeopathic remedies which are are one of the things I can easily carry with the amount of weight you can take which is very little internationally that even T your bottles are hard to carry so I really work with the homeopathics a lot and to me they're one of the real Magics of uh the Plant World as well they are yeah it's the plants kind of Branch off into these different systems of healing you know Homeopathy The Flower Essences you know herbalism as a physical treatment herbalism as a shamanic treatment and even allopathic medicine right so much of it was based on you know herbal constituents so they just kind of you know we we sort of group everything in that Herbal Healing world but yeah do you know about Mullen like Mullen does have a long history of being used for bronchial um and it's it's kind of an amazing era because it's an astringent and it's soothing at the same time but um I when you were mentioning that like you've had kind of you know mild but kind of chronic issues with your lungs and the lungs are like uh the organ that is kind of always related to grief right and I think you're not like a grieving person but you know ever since you've been young you've had this tremendous sensitivity for the pain of the earth you know and I just would see that that there would always be that you know kind of sensitivity that would be resting in your lungs so it just makes sense to use the herbs to help lift that out I think that's that's really beautiful and you know most people don't use it as a um a smudge you know that burning of it for doing that but that's an old actually it's an old indigenous treat treatment is to smoke the herbs and then breathe that smoke out so yeah it's really beautiful you just instinctively knew that you know knew how to do that or somebody had pointed it out to you but it you know you just yeah and then I I did want to point out to that aha you know when you see that herbs really work and I remember when I first started practicing and people would you know this is back in the 1960s and people would say Well they're Antiquated you know this is before herbalism was popular and things they don't work anymore and I would just laugh and I would say you should take a little grade of cayenne and tell me it doesn't work you know or cascara ciga which is a very powerful ax of drink a cup of cascara cata and tell me these plants don't work but the truth of the matter is they would have been discarded thousands of years ago because you know people have passed on the best of what works and we're even doing that today so yeah those are wonderful stories may I may I say one other thing here oh please of my childhood was that my mom's lineage had been broken her her mom ended up in a family with small pox the whole family except two girls died they orphaned them off two white families and they didn't meet each other until they were 80 years old and So what had happened to my mom was that she and so many around the boarding school issue you know I don't have to go over that but all the children were taken to boarding schools and the whole lineage of spirit and herbalism and all of that was lost so my mom out there on that lonesome far out no medicine no doctor no help kind of place had she known about herbs she would have had such um a happier and easier life with us children and and with everything that went on and so you know I just feel like I want to say to to all of you who are interested in herbs you know pick up a bit of it and pass it on you know a lot of people I think I remember Stephen and I didn't realize that Stephen had left us you mentioned him uh he he mentioned you mentioned many other people in all of these uh ways say you know it's my grandmother she used to take me out and show me stuff really set deep in them so for those of you whether you're your mother dad grandma or Grandpa you know know that even just the most simple thing that you think pick them out and and and share something beautiful on the land and I was listening to a as a matter of fact I was reading something I was in a beautiful Botanical Garden uh a Mediterranean garden over on the Azure coast of um France and one of the botanists there they had two or three or four just saying what their experience was and this one man said take your children out and let them be connected with the Earth and play and enjoy and the water and the plants and the forests and he said when that happens they will form this loving attachment to the Earth and it doesn't matter if they go on and become a businessman or what they might do but they will always remember the their love for the Earth and be the kind of people who are earthkeepers at one level or the other they will support the Earth so I think that kind of thing is so important it doesn't matter whether everyone becomes an herbalist but any kind of you can share with children about the the natural world and the plants and and and the just the the big magic of it all yeah I mean that's so exciting because we need that deep love it's you know we it's so good to establish it on our children because kind of trying to figure it out when you're older is a whole different and less heartful kind of way coaching it I think it's one of the most important things we can do is share with the children and you know when you don't have that connection you have a deep loneliness in your soul you know you have a deep loneliness for that your whole life you know and I think that's why when we see adults that would come to those herb conferences or join us in a class they would just it would be almost like a homecoming for them you know they would be so turned on by this simple it was just simple thing here a few plant and here's how you make medicine but it was like it just connected them to something so deep in themselves so yeah I so agree with you sweetie share with the children just in general when people don't have Earth skills of any kind and I don't mean anything fancy I mean I had people I always tried to make have people make something do a project of some kind with their hands in the and so a lot of times we'd need to sew a little something and there were a lot of there was mostly women there were a lot of women who had never ever picked up a sewing needle yeah didn't know how to do anything and what it was sad to me because I thought there must be some part of their body that is nervous about should anything happen should you know should they need to be able to do anything they don't know how to do anything and so like I love to learn to make fire or to you know to learn a few herbal things or to do all of that and one of the reasons that I want to say to you all of you very clearly is that my experience is that when we don't know how to do anything like that and also when we don't have Community which is another wonderful thing to build community we know we're worth we know that we don't have any backup we know that if something goes wrong there's nothing and no one and we're just lost and for me that creates greed the way we solve that we try to solve it but it doesn't actually work because money won't buy anything if we have real crisis the way we try to solve it is we try to save money or get money or get stuff or get things you know build a a for around us of those things and that's a pretty empty Fortress if we don't have knowledge of the natural world and a community in which to be able to rest that's so such a wise words it's Brook on so many levels yeah a beautiful incredible message it's it's so inspiring to hear you carrying this message on you ever since I've known you which has been over 40 years that first time I heard you sing at that medicine wheel Gathering you have been such a strong advocate you know and you and I could tell I haven't spoken to you for quite a long time and I could tell you are still out there strongly doing the work it's so beautiful you know I had a couple more questions and then I did want to I did want to ask you you know and definitely wanted you to spend some time sharing with our listeners you know what you are doing right now but I it's a such a sensitive subject and I felt like you would be such an important person to ask because you are a bridge worker you know you do have uh indigenous we all have indigenous backgrounds but you have direct lineage with our native Heritage with your native Heritage and yet you also have walked freely in the world and shared with everybody which is not always uh greeted with you know it's been um it's become an issue you know and it's sad to me because so many of our teachers were Elder indigenous people from different parts of the world who wanted these teachings to be carried on and of course they wanted them to be carried on respectfully but I just wonder if you can share a little bit about you know your view of cultural uh appropriation you know and how we can be really sensitive in cultural appreciation where we are passing down the teachings of the earth well I love that that cultural appreciation kind of thing and the thought of of the elders and others who who really wanted to share the knowledge who really knew that it was important for everyone and you know the challenge we have had is that in the old days let's say we were in a village and someone popped up and said well I can do this ceremony I haven't studied it but I can do it I you know I'm and boom the elders would have been on them and said uh oh come on you need to slow down and let me show you and you know are you really meant for this and blah blah blah and so there was a kind of um you know taking care of things in that way but now it's you know we've lost our elders we're connected to everything we you know pick up this and that that you know we it's so easy to to not go deep into things yeah but one of the things you know I I want to say is that there are so many things that I feel are sort of claimed by some native people that are just human things for instance let's talk about purification Lodge a lot of you have probably done sweat lodge you know and put some some beautiful Willow and cover it and put some hot St or stones in stones and pour water on it well there are some native tribes who say that belongs to us in fact it's been done around the whole world I have Scott ancestors who do what it's called a clog on exactly the same thing I have a teeny bit of Danish interestingly enough and my Scandinavian and danish ancestors have a permanent sweat lodge called a sauna and it's always been where prayers and things were done and uh all over the world World there have been sweat lodges so what's important I think is that we can do those things because they're natural to us as a human family if you've ever been in a sweat lodge you know it doesn't matter whether you walk you know get out in the mud when you crawl out you're internally clean you have prayed you haveed your pores you are so clean and so it's a natural thing but the thing that gets us in trouble and where I think we need to get clear about our lines and boundaries is that if you're doing saying oh I'll do a west facing Lakota healing Lodge and you don't know anything about it you might have seen one you don't know anything you haven't been trained that really does belong to those people they have developed that that's theirs and so to claim that you can do that without training and without honoring and respecting that is is is not right is not right and in any way and certainly even to use sweat lodge and not know what you're doing is not okay you know we know instances where people have been harmed and even died in some of those kind of situations where people didn't know what they were doing so it's so important that you learn and ground yourself in whatever you're wanting to do and also not claim unless you are working with someone who can teach you a very specific way of a very specific people then it's really important that you you uh you know that you don't do those things but I I was with one time I was with a beautiful Elder of the Loda tradition and there's been a lot of issue about whether you can do the you know carry a sacred pipe or Chupa and I asked her about that and she said she was so wonderful she was this Fierce little tiny beautiful amazing traditional woman and she said everyone should carry the pipe and pray with it in the right way she said we need all all the prayers we can get and if people are carrying it in a good way and have learned about it everyone should be praying and praying with the pipe is a powerful way you know you need to learn what you're doing and respect and honor it you know it's not a game it's not something to play with there's enormous power there so I don't know I just feel like in so many ways uh you know even people claiming they own the drum and should be able to see what happens with drums I mean that is so ignorant and lacking an understanding drums have been around forever and ever one hand drums the small hand drums you know you can see things back in the Greek and on and on as as long as we can see symbols there have been people using the Drone and women using that hand drum and in some of the Traditions I've studied the women had those smaller drums which represent the circle the feminine the womb the Earth and they then allowed or gave the bigger drums to the men to help them come into Rhythm and to bring their energy up from their sexual chakras up to their heart by calling the people and joining the people together around those big drums so on the other side of it I can really understand how our native people like we've taken everything else everything you've taken our land you've taken our you took our children away from us you have taken our wealth you've taken our herbal not you've taken everything and now you're taking what it's like so I I really understand that I understand that emotion and yet I think it's so important to for me I pay more attention to those heartful and wise people who they may have that feeling in a way but they also know that these things are important for the larger world to learn you know the more we learn about all our relations the more we learn about the teachings of of the earth peoples the primary peoples the more likely we're going to stay here not only us out in a more modern world and off the reservations now all of that the many colored people but also the the people on reservations the more traditional Native people because if we mess this world up it's messed up for everybody everybody gets to go free so you know we're that's part of the lesson is to is that we are one family like it or not we are one big family and the more more we um the more the modern world you know changes things and moves things around and and uh you know every disease every uh weed you know if you want to call them weeds anything you know they they become weeds when they're in a place they don't have natural Predators traft but you know all of that kind of uh thing we're just all one big group here and we're all as some of the old teachers used to say we're all walking each other home and we need to do it in the best way we can so I just say to people be respectful be honoring go deep into what you're doing find out find a way to learn and and then understand that when you're coming from your heart and when you're doing it in a good way to help people hopefully that you know that will be Smiled On in a good way even though there are people out there that are angry and and not will challenge that in some ways do that help oh Brook is so wise those those words are so incredibly wise and so well spoken you know and I just want to Echo what you were just saying is that there was a a beautiful Elder teacher from Hawaii railen Lancaster and she has this gorgeous Hawaii name I I just can't never say it so I just call her by her English name brilene Lancaster she died you may have met her she was a one of the more powerful eloquent speakers at the international and she mostly just would come and chant and sing for us you know she was just such a just an incredible human being a bowl of light right and I went over I led a few trips over to Hawaii with PL my plat lovers Journeys right and to study with her with other Hawaiian elders and you know the first few times I went I could really feel like the earth and the communities there and how the native communities the Hawaiians there was you know be be beneath all the tourism was this Spirit of unrest you know and it was it was building on the volcano but it was coming from the people and I asked raene about it you know knowing that the United States government had gone and you know militarily overtaken Hawaii and you know a and just claimed a sovereign country and so there's this teeming resentment there and railene said to me she goes well the young people are very angry about it you know she's talking about a certain group of young people she said they have a right to be you know it's understandable just like you're saying it's very understandable why they are she said but then she goes but they just haven't learned yet that we are all one people you know so you know that we are all one we're all here to learn together and to share together so that was you know she just looked it said the very kind of the very same thing that you did is that it's understandable the anger but as we walk the medicine way we realize these are teachings of the earth and they're what bring us in balance and that they're here to share with everyone because she freely would share those you know those traditional ceremonies with us as a teaching for that we would receive the gifts from that land yeah very well spoken sweetie you know we're coming almost coming to the end of their time and I I want to just a couple more things I just wanted to ask you um if there is you know for all the things that you've done and we've only touched on a few I mean really literally I know that you have touched thousands of people who had your teachings is there anything that you're that you've done that you're most proud of that you look back and just feel really good about or I should say really really really good about because I'm sure you feel good about it all no um you know one of the things that I feel good about is actually for myself personally that I have stayed healthy I know one black El said to some people he said you know the one who's going to hang around is Brook she's taken care of herself and she will be here a long long long time and uh so you know Having learned and really uh everyone says always must be natural to you but I work really hard at that and you know doing natural kind of things is really really helpful but I think in some ways the the Wilderness camps that I have done and I hope to continue doing I have things scheduled now in Colorado and and here in France uh where we can take people out on the land because as I was saying it just you know teaching people about the Earth in some room in a hotel in you know in a big city is the worst I mean I'm in a sense I'm myself for having done that and tried it and Carri the message there but the things that have I guess in the sense not that I'm so proud of but that I'm the most joyous about and the most excited about when I when I want to energize myself I think about that kind of thing more than anything else that I've done so kind of hanging in there over this long term you know um and uh and continuing to offer those things uh you know I guess that's what I the most proud of is just coming from in a sense not knowing so much U not being really traditional and I have of course maintained all my life that I'm not a real traditional teacher but just carrying uh carrying my love for the Earth and sharing that with people I think and and hoping that they can find that inside themselves I'm really proud of that for sure I'm so proud of that too Brooke as I said like through everything through all the changes in your life and the many times you've moved you've just always always carried that spark outward to people it's yeah it's definitely something that you should be excited and joyous for and you do radiate wellbeing I mean I I met you I haven't seen you in a while you know when you showed up on on Zoom I had to laugh because you know I met you as a young woman we were both like you know in it was in the 19 early early 1980s when I first met you at that or maybe the end of the 1970s it was a long time ago and yet you still have EX actly the same Radiance I don't think you've changed much at all it's remarkable actually and I do know that it's not just jeans I you know part of it we always give thanks to the good genes that early our early development but also I do know that you walk your talk you know that's one thing you definitely are a woman who walks her medicine talk and have done that every step of the way so do you want to share just a little about you're doing so many exciting things I'm gonna join you either in France or here back in the States when you come but and also let people know we'll we'll have your website listed on our website as well but will you just share a little bit about what you're doing and and where people can find you on the web yeah you know it's basically just medicine eagle.com and you can sign up on the mailing list there and and I don't send out very much probably I'm not a very good media person but anyway I'd love to have you there but the things I'm I'm here in Europe right now and uh and teaching uh especially right now in France and I went expand that a bit more uh but one of the things I'm really excited about is I'm doing a Vision Quest here in France and it turns out that on our family farm the family that I'm with here have a farm up in the highlands and there is a Mesa there that is stunning have a picture of it on on my Facebook and so those cultures fly over that thing and it's just amazing so I'm wanting to take people up this summer to be there and then also I'm coming back back to the States and I'm very much in love with Southwestern Colorado around the four corners area and inviting people to come on what I call cathedrals in the Pines which is to just experience the beauty of the ruins there and the and the gorgeous Golden Leaves and and being able to sit out uh we don't usually have time to do like a formal Vision Quest but I always call it visioning time where you know most of us if we just sit a long day or overnight into the next day that a beautiful time for us so anyway you can see on my website about that and then I have a couple other things that I'd love to share with people one of them is um you can subscribe to my we are earthkeepers program it's a continuing monthly program I do a little setup teaching and then we do a ceremony for the Earth every every month and uh I really would love to have you join me on that I'm join the the better you know the more powerful we can be so we are earthkeepers you'll see that on my site and then another thing I have and I've focused it mainly on women uh because I've felt the need to support women's energy of the feminine in this Awakening time of the feminine it's called the power and Beauty wisdom series and in that I talk about women's Mysteries and teachings which I think men need to learn as well I talk about the ancient brain that just how this system works that we can Empower ourselves with and also a section Called Love is the answer about the Dawnstar teachings about love as the answer to uh what we need on Earth it's to me it's the basic message that sense of love the non star teachings and the connectiveness of the feminine through bu a woman so those things are there and uh you can connect up on the site and I've got lots of little teachings and all sorts of things that I'd love to share with you so it would be great to uh be in touch with all of you I hope to see some of you when I'm back in the States again awesome Brooke really I have to say that just sharing with you my heart is just so wide open just you know again it's that energy I just I'm so moved by your words would you mind just singing one one CH just one of your songs to close with I hate to ask you because
