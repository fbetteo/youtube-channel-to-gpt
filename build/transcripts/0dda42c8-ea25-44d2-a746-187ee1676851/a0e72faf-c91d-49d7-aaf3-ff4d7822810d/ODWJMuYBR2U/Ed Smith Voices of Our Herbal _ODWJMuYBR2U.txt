hi friends welcome to interviews voices of our herbal Elders this is my opportunity to talk to some of my dearest friends people who have not only influenced my herbal work but also have had a major influence on the revitalization of American herbalism most of us began our herbal work around the same time in the early 1970s and 80s when herbalism was still mostly underground a place where plants actually Thrive quite well I love hearing people tell their herbal stories of how they began their herbal work who and what inspired them their favorite plant in healing stories and I felt that others would be interested in hearing them as well in fact I felt it was important to capture these stories before this generation of Elders passed on as we're all destined to do and I can feel the [Music] sky I know that I'm part of the when I see the sunrise I am thankful to be here I am thankful my welcomed and honored guest today is Ed Smith more commonly known in herbal circles as herbal Ed Ed has been actively involved in the herbal world since 1975 in 1979 Ed and Sarah cats founded Herb Farm an organic Herb Farm one of the first of its kind that produced what was to become some of the finest quality herb products in the world Herb Farm products help set the standard for the herbal industry Ed has played quite a role in modern Western herbalism he is a co-founder of the American herbalist Guild the American herbal products Association and serves on The Advisory Board of the American Botanical Council he is also founding member and a long-term supporter of United PLS saers and has won numerous awards for his work with herbs and in 2013 was awarded an honorary doctorate from the National College of naturopathic medicine for his lifetime achievements in Botanical medicine and there are so many other accomplishments that Ed has achieved over the years you can read his complete bio on the podcast website but suffice it to say that Ed has served as an ambassador for the plants for almost 50 years and while supposedly semi-retired he remains an active adviser to the urban industry he and his lovely wife Nook currently live in Thailand so Ed thank you so much for joining me I've been looking forward to this opportunity to speak to you you're one of my oldest herbal buddies and you're also a great Storyteller thank you Rosie I'm glad to be here great well I'd like to start at the beginning or at least the beginning as I know it if I could recall correctly you worked with an Wigmore at the hypocrates Health Institute in Boston back in the 1970s can you share a little bit about that time sure I was living in Boston at the time and uh was just getting involved with herbs and uh you know didn't know anything but uh in the in the Valley of the blind oneeyed man is king So I didn't know much about hers but I knew more than most people and uh anyway I used to go to hypocrates on Sunday night they had a big huge uh free banquet a raw food banquet with all these different sprouts and grass and sunflower greens and uh and was free and then uh Victor scincus who some of the some of the listeners may know was uh was there he would do a lecture on Sunday night and uh and so anyway I would go almost every Sunday got into raw food or sproutary and diet and uh and victorus was leaving and uh he asked me would I take over his position wow and and I said really I mean that's like being a garage band saying hey we got a gig at the Apollo Theater I mean you know paring Health insute was like world famous Dr Ed Wigmore Dr an migor bless her heart was an incredible woman uh you know and and very eccentric and uh and uh anyway so I became uh the senior lecturer I mean I was like I went from nobody to like apoc elth Institute every Sunday and I would uh I would do uh do the introductory lecture about raw food and display the principles of raw food and then I would do questions and then uh two days a week I would do uh massage therapy that's how I made my money there I didn't get paid the Dr R never paid anybody for anything everybody would volunteer so anyway I was doing to you know and most of my massage clients were people with cancer you know really a lot of bad cancer uh you crippling arthritis you all kinds of different diseases man I jumped into the deep end of the pool you mean I I had been studying massage for a couple years and uh so I did that and I supervised or I don't like the word supervised but any I counseled people on the uh on the the raw food Sprout tyian diet you know with wheat grass you know everything from wheat we used I used to say if you got a hole in it wash it out with wheat grass you know nasal washes ear washes eye washes uh of course of course en course you know so anyway I I got a it was a great time in my life it was two years I was teaching yoga at the incal yoga Institute which I helped to found and uh and I got to meet people from all over the world and uh and uh a lot of them were sick although we used to get these very cute models that would come in from New York and wanted to come and lose weight because had a big model shoot in in Milan or something so you know yeah and uh so anyway it was uh Dr an was was quite a character although she did now that she's passed away I can tell it she loved popcorn oh god oh that's so funny well everybody has their vies and it wasn't and it wasn't it wasn't sprouted popcorn you know I think that probably a lot of our listeners don't even know who an Wigmore is which is so unfortunate but she was really like the queen one of the early I call her the queen of the Sprouts right she was one of the early advocates for Healthy Living and a raw food diet and she was you like you said she was quite eccentric which many of our Elder teachers were maybe we are as well but um well she she was from I forget she was somewhere from Eastern Europe and uh and she came to the United States when uh the Russians took over whatever and but she was raised by her grandmother she was a sickly child she was raised by her grandmother and her grandmother used to go out into the fields and pick wild herbs and grasses and Juice them and had her drink all these wild herbs and and grass juices and she claims that that's what bought her health back you know whatever and then she wrote wrote a book called be your own doctor yeah which is kind of kind of you know and uh and uh she just uh she had a winning formula people came from all over the world all over the world yeah she was she was revolutionary in her teaching she you know we had her actually um in our very early on at the Stellar energy exchange the little Retreat Center that we had in gerville like so that was again back in the 70s you know you also had the amazingly Good Fortune to work alongside the legendary Dr John Christopher and I'd love to hear a little bit about that how you connected with him and what your role was because I know that you were like you were like co- teing with him right yeah yeah well I again this this period I was in Boston from 1970 to 77 although I spent five Winters in South America uh so anyway this was about the time and I and uh so this is at a time when there was there was only one herb School in the that I even knew about Dominion in Canada yes there unlike today there were no herb classes there were no herb schools there were no herb lectures there were books but very few of them you know Back to Eden which by the way and I tell my students don't don't think that you're too you're too good or you're too cool for back to eat you know I say the same thing you know it's a classic you've got to it's a classic you got to read it yeah so you know so so would go I would go to all the the bookstores the new age bookstores the spiritual bookstores all the health grood stores in Boston and Cambridge and there was a new book on herbs I I didn't leave through it I bought it yeah I just picked it off to shelf and I bought it I read a 100 herb books in two years wow and U but anyway I started hearing about some some of the people that were coming to par from California kept hearing about this guy named Dr Christopher yeah and I yeah and I said wow this sounds pretty cool but I then somebody gave me some I think it was probably a fifth copy zerox copy of their notes you could barely read them of the they did the Dr Christopher training yeah for about a week or one and they had all these notes so I was reading this was like the whole you know I was reading the notes till you know till the burning the midnight o and anyway long story short it is a very long story long story short I I W up uh hearing a friend that I had been apocy he said I lived in Santa Cruz she said Dr Christopher is coming to Santa Cruz there's this guy named Michael Tiara oh God who who's this is in 1974 yeah 1974 and said this guy named Michael T is bringing Dr chrisan he's going to do a week long uh herb herb seminar uh and uh why don't you come out so I did I flew out I did this whole week with Dr Christopher and uh and I'm not a shy guy you might have figured that one out by now and uh so I just you know I I would find out who Dr see during the breaks I trying to find who's Dr Chris who's Dr Chris I found out he was hiding in the car in the parking lot so so so I would I would go to the uh I would go to the car and uh started talking to him and uh and I knew a bit about herbs I mean not a whole lot but a a lot more than everybody else or most people and so anyway we became buddies and and uh he uh he wanted to he he his dream was to have an herb school yeah remember remember his book was called the school of of uh natural healing wasn't it yeah the school of natural healing yes the school of natural healing yes his dream was to have an actual school and he told me I've got this guy he's going to come in and he he sees my dream and he's going to help me raise money for it or whatever anyway uh so I came back to to Boston and my friend Ary Fryman who started the new the school of acupuncture first Acupuncture school in America in Boston he said listen I'm I'm going to bring this guy out named Dr Chris I'm bringing him to Boston to to do his week-long training and to raise funds for the and you uh and somebody told me you know him I said well I met him a couple times and would you help me take care of him while he's here we'll pick him up at the airport we'll take him to the motel and take him out to dinner I said sure I'd love to I'd love to so anyway Dr Christoper comes in and uh God there's so many stories I could tell so many stories uh so he comes in and he had really bad gout his feet were about this big oh he could Hardy he would could Hardy Walk and uh so we but Ary had uh through his Connections in Harvard Ary got this great lecture hall for Dr Christoper to do his lecture from 7 o'clock in the evening till 9:30 in the evening so we had to go to the go to the uh motel and do the fireman's car I don't know if you know how to do the fireman's carry where you when you link arm two guys link arms and Dr Christoper would sit and we would lift him up and would take him to to the car put and we had to get we had to get to the Lexus early so we could put we could farm and lift the water take him in and put him in his chair behind the desk and then we would let people come into the Le [Laughter] Hall so uh and anyway we took him back to the motel and he Dr G hated that he said I can walk and he put in the walk he couldn't walk oh and and so we were carrying him in and uh there people come out their standing and Dr Christopher says says uh I'm not drunk and I said shut up you old fool and did he have a did he have a good sense of humor yeah he had a great sense of humor yeah a craziest so anyway but but but Dr Christopher says Eddie I'm starting my school we're going to be opening up in a couple months I want you to come and be a teacher at my school one oh my God a teacher at Dr Chris school oh my God yes so you know so I uh so I'm getting ready you I'm I'm get I'm finding somebody to take over my apartment I'm giving hypocrates and notice and I'm leaving or whatever and two days before I'm supposed to leave to go to Utah Dr Chris calls me up and he says Eddie I'm so sorry long story short the guy that was helping him build the school was a conand ripped him off oh ripped his money off destroyed his dream oh no and Dr CHR said I'm so sorry Eddie but I can't we're not having and I said well fine I mean he was he was hurting a lot more than I was so I said okay I understand look H so how where's the story going so Arie Fran was moving to Portland Oregon the guy that started in the school of acupuncture was moving to Portland Oregon and he said uh Ed I I oh what Dr Chris was stilling boss he said Ary said Dr chrisal I have I have a degree in education I've started two schools already and I started the new ENG School of acupuncture I will make your school dream come true I will help you do that do that school he said but I'm going to need it he said but I'm going to need Eddie to help me Eddie are you going to come to are you going to come to Portland Oregon I said uh uh yeah you know talking about a s decision so fast forward i i w up in Portland Oregon which is where I met Sarah Sarah C and uh so so anyway uh that was life changing Ary was going to the new I'm sorry was going to the uh Western States Chiropractic College that's why he was moving back East so I go uh and we have our first meeting and Ary had gotten a couple of the other chiropractor students to be on our board uh they were very cool guys and they were into good diet and natural healing like a lot of chiropractors were back then and uh so anyway but uh and so they all come for this meeting and and uh and who who was not invited but just came as a because one of the people on the board of directors was a roommate with his cute beautiful hot young woman named Sarah Catz and she walked in I went hello and well that's another long story she would that's an ongoing story yes yes yeah yeah yeah right right so anyway uh we W up creating a thing called the foundation for natural living yeah and uh and to raise funds we decided we going to put on these Herridge uh herb Retreats not just herbs but natural healing Retreats yeah and we had and we had Dr Christopher we had Victor scincus we had uh the chiropractor the iridology Bernard Jensen oh Dr Jensen yes you had all of the elders you had like the leading speakers at that time it was those are amazing guy named Ted capu oh yeah uh who lived in Cambridge also so uh well I've never done any anything like this before ever and Barney says well you're in charge of the into the herb the the conferences so I said well I made every mistake you can make because I've never done it before one thing we do we rent of this boy scout cap about 30 mil outside of Tucson and never went and inspected it first oh dear so anyway I wind up going to uh uh arriving at this Boys Club Camp up in the mountains on this dirt Road the place was it wasn't filthy but it wasn't clean yeah and it was raining like crazy you know and we got to pick people up at the airport and people are coming in late there's a 60 mile round trip and and I'm I'm I'm going nuts I'm pulling my hair out because I'm the I'm the guy that everybody's coming to when you hear your name you know Eddie come quick from four different people at the same time so anyway but uh I I will tell you one story that's really fun so Dr Christoper didn't come right away about the second or third day Dr Christoper flies in so I went in to Tucson to pick him up and we got get all his bags and everything say so we got everything not to Cru go no wait I got some boxes coming uh oh and you see these boxes coming one after the other he had six six cases of Dr Christopher's lore Bal tonic six cases and and I I said what's I knew about lower B I said what's this Dr Chris we goes we're going to give everybody at the conference is going to get a uh a lower b a bottle of lower bonic oh dear that's scary so yeah it is so the next night we we scheduled him in the evening so that there were no other competing classes which everybody wanted to go see Dr Christopher so anyway he comes in everybody comes in and he goes and he's doing a class on the lower bow tonic and herbal laxatives and you know bow cleansing and all stuff as I'm with Dr Christopher's orders giving everybody a bottle of lower bony well the next morning and I'm not exaggerating the next morning every toilet in the camp was plugged up they were one the grossest saes I've ever seen in my life and they were all Stu and for fortunately my maintenance guy was a I said amen he goes I know oh my goodness plung plung the plunger you know with with all these species run over running on the floor and uh so anyway uh so I told Dr Christ I said Dr Christopher never never do that no more samples never do that again no more samples please yeah those are there are really some incredible memories for sure things that you don't always want to remember but those were the early days this is going to interface with you because uh we never created Dr Christopher School per se but we created the thing called the California school of naturopathic medicine okay and Sona County on uh what what was it called it was Monterosa Heights I think it was up in um uh mon R Roa in near gville yes it was Monta Rosa so anyway we uh we sawed the naturopathic College yes the first one actually well not the first the first one c not the first one in America no the first one in California I think actually the first one in in um the Pacific coast that I know of no no no the one important uh was way before that the one important was in the 19 1940s oh okay so so anyway uh we started uh the stage of B College well Sarah and I we were at a Crossroads you know we didn't I didn't want to I was bored of being a board M you know I I just it wasn't what it's not what I signed up for you know I wanted to do herbs I wanted to live in the country you know I didn't want to move you know whatever and move again whatever and so and I I said Arie uh and the other guy said listen I'm not coming Sarah I not coming we're going to stay in forland we we'll come down I'll teach I'll do anything I'll do anything and everything I can to to help you guys but I'm not moving to California I'm staying in Portland so anyway a few months later I came down to not Ro what was it called yeah you mean the where that where the naturopathic school was yeah yeah was it it was in monter Rio monter Rio well yeah we called it Macho Rio because there was so many bikers there and U so anyway I came down and I forget exactly but you were there at the school I don't know if you I don't know if you said on my class or whatever you did yeah but uh you know this the first time I ever laid eyes on you and uh I I'd heard about you and heard about uh your you know your your herb classes and stuff and we met and you you said uh you should come down sometime and teach at one of my Retreats and I said yeah win you know and uh long story short I I forget how long it was but a month or two later ly hle I wound up in or hot springs oh yeah you know te teaching and uh Rosary I mean you it was a great opportunity for me man you put me you put you know you put me in the big time on the west coast you know I took a want some Le nobody knew knew herbal Ed in the East I have to go back East if I wanted to get a big enough crowd in the lexer to make some money but uh so anyway I went down and and taught at the U or hot springs uh down by uh out the back of my old International Scout and uh and uh people would say you know this is like an old medicine will this is like an old medicine wagon I said it's not like one it is one it's a 1970s uh version of one I teach out the back of my class and then I uh we laid out I laid out a guamal and blanket on the grass right by this this river that came through and I had been making some tentures I can tell you more about how that started later but making some tentures and uh and I laid them on the ground on the F and after the CL they were all hand type labels so would type all the labels by hand putting putting a Avery labels of a typewriter typ by hand that's how she learned to spell kaop ubala by typing it by typing it 20 times in a row and uh so anyway after the class people crowded around the and every bottle was gone within about 20 minutes and I had I would never forget I had $350 in my hand and I went and I went wow that was that was that was pretty easy so we so we went back home to Oregon and I forget when the next event was that you were having one but instead of making tenses in PIP mason jars I graduated to court mason jars yeah big time went back down again same thing again put the blanket out laid the tenses out but I had twice as many this time and people crowded after the class crowded bought every single bottle and I had $700 cash in my hand that's a that was a lot of money in the in the it was a lot of money yes 1978 or whatever and uh and there was this one woman in the class and she said you know I have a small little herb shop healthy store in ohigh California oh do you guys have do you guys have a Wholesale catalog and I said no we don't but we will next week so I went back to Oregon and got out the typewriter and typed out my first catalog you know thank God for white out this is before word processes and uh I forget what I think we had 12 or 15 entes yeah and that and that store in Ohio was our first ever uh Wholesale customer or yeah and if I could if I could interrupt you for a minute I just want to share my recollection because I do remember inviting you to come to that first herb conference um well I'd been hosting them before that but that first one that you came to and you know you were invited because I I knew that you knew a lot about herbs so that was the thing you know we we didn't know nearly as much as there is to know now but we were so impassionate and you had that passion but I remember you and Sarah selling out of that orange I remember it was kind of an orangey van that's sort of the color I remember and I do remember you sitting out there with those the thing that I really I want my listeners to know is that this was at a time when nobody else was selling ures at least that I knew of and at least on the west coast and it was the quality also it wasn't just the tinctures and you really you and Sarah right from the beginning were emphasizing the quality so one of the things I remember at that Gathering it might have been not been the very first one but shortly thereafter you had made a display a homemade display and it had pictures of it had not pictures it actually had samples of the we were all selling in our store and you also had samples of the herbs that you and Sarah were growing and wildcrafting right and you were saying to us and this was a really big teacher this was back in the 1970s so it's very important that people get this you were saying to us you know look at the Quality look at what we've been using we're all like a bunch of UPS herbalists we think the plants are grown in the UPS truck and shipped out of the UPS truck and that really stuck to with us you know we really got it you you and Sarah really advocated for upping the quality of the plants that we were selling in our stores and the products and years later like actually almost 30 years later when we or 25 years later when we when we came together to form United plant Sabers I really advocated for the name you United plant saers UPS because I would I said that you know when we first started this kind of Renaissance and we first started teaching and trying to bring herbalism back to the American public that had really forgotten about how powerful these plants could be you our problem then was quality and and availability and making sure that people are getting educated about plants and now 30 you know 25 years later it's really about preserving our tradition and preserving the plants the jurisic is based on but I really always like to honor you for that powerful teaching that you brought forth at that time so thank you so much you know and you know sometimes people have said well we need to change the name United plants saers because it's so much like tree hugging and I said well that's the very best part about it absolutely I always say you know yeah it's so true we are tree huggers thank God thank goodness but also because I'm very attached to that name because it really represents the issues that we're facing today so I really want to thank you for that well I I I spelled nature with a capital n i and uh absolutely never ever apologize for being a tree hugger I'm absolutely a tree hugger I know yeah so you know I have a bunch more questions I want to ask and um I there's so much we could go back into the history I mean it like when you're telling these stories it it course elicits when that uh event that that the college had put on that you hosted in monterio the reason I went to that well first of all because there wasn't hardly anything going on in the herbal world but also because I lived right down the street from that camp where you held that event I lived a block away so it was like this school in my backyard but I wanted to ask you Ed I'm always curious and I don't really think I've ever heard this story from you with what you're first aha moment with the plants where you know that maybe that would I like to say that moment where you felt the plants really calling you into the magical Green World do you do you recall a time when that happened I know there's probably so many stories well I made some notes Here may not and it may not be what you expect uh the AHA there were several aha moments and the the very first one was when I was in the US Army in 19 65 def not what I expected in 1965 and I don't know how I found out about it but I found out that morning glory seeds contain lysergic acid right this is what lsd's made out of and I don't know how I found out about it but I was reading the at the time I was reading Time Magazine I was reading about hate ashberry you know I was reading about hippies you know I was reading about Joan bers and Bob Dylan and you know I was like wow that sounds that sounds pretty cool but but here I am in Germany in the Army 20 22 years old and uh so anyway I I I found out about these morning gory sces I said I'm going to try it so so I went to I went to the PX and I went into the gardening section I walked up and down I saw oh they had a little the spam morning seeds and they had four different colors and I saidwell I wonder which one I should buy I rather and there was one called Heavenly Blues I said yeah that's the one that's the one I want so I bought this heavenly blue moror seeds I took them back to the barracks this was on Saturday I would say in the barracks on Saturday everybody else went away to whatever I stayed in the VAR Clos I had private time so anyway I bring the seeds back and their hardest can be just really hard I couldn't bite them so you know I said oh great what am I going to do now so back to the back to the X and I'm looking for uh and and this this became something I W up doing many many many times as Herb Farm was a small company and growing as a biger company I walked I went into the kitchen section and I walked up and down the aisles go what can I use what can I use to make those seeds break those seeds what can I use I walk by I also I looked and there was a pepper grinder I said a pepper grinder and the morning G seed were about the size of a pepper corn yes so I went back to the barracks with the and I put the morning G seeds in the pepper grinder and I made a uh I made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I ground the morning or seeds on top of the peanut butter and jelly you know just gring gring course what whatever put the on ate the sandwich well my whole life changed that day I I bet uh oh and and uh and it was uh anyway I I'll give you a very short version of it but about 4 hours later in the middle of the night I I'm I'm sitting in this big huge soccer field way away from the rest of the the the uh army base and I'm sitting there and all of a sudden I I just wake up huh where am I at where am I I look go God how did I wind up here so that was that was uh my first my first herbal experience your Heavenly Blue experience my heavenly blue experience so along with that came again of course uh cannabis uh the the thing that that this is is actually hopefully answering your question the thing that the real eye opener was not not so much the Psychedelic experience the fact that these Siege these little seeds yes could have this profound effect on my neuro chemistry you know my neurophysiology was like wow it's like magic you how potent right yeah how potent so anyway fast forward I've been living in Cambridge and I I'm uh a smoking pot and uh I was at a party now it's legal now yeah I was at a party now we can talk about it and uh I was at a party and there was this guy he was such a a-hole and his father was like one of the most famous surgeons at at uh at uh Mass general which is Harvard Medical School hospital and uh and and uh and we're sharing a a joint and he goes to me he says and I and he says you're into herbs or whatever I forget how what exactly what he said he says you're into herbs you you don't think those things really work do you I mean you don't think they really work me and I and I said uh I don't know what do you think as I pass him the joint and he goes well that's different I said no it's not different it's an herb called Cannabis sativa and it contains these canavan that uh that work on your neurochemistry of your brain so if this this plant can do it why can't and there's hundreds of thousands of other plants out there with millions of different chemicals in them what makes you think that cannabis is the only one that will have a physiological or psychological effect on your body good point and it but it was also again it was just reconfirming what I was already knew it was like giving me giving me evidence you know that hey these things actually do work and then uh and then of course came magic mushrooms and then IAA and and uh you know anded I've heard I've heard U you know we would sit in the herbal Gatherings and stuff there was always a group of herbalists who say you know we became herbalists because of one plant but it did lead into this amazing healing work you know like I think it part because of that expansive of mind you know and to be able to see into those other dimensions but I know cannabis does get quite a bit of Honor from a lot of herbalist as being the plant that led him into the gateway of herbalism well like I said I mean not not not only was there the psychic experience you know the psychological experience but that these things have chemicals in them that actually have a pharmacological activity I can I can experience the fact that I took this plant you know the fact that that my mind is opening up or the that I'm getting these these wavy kind of colors in the sky when I'm eating my mushrooms and whatever it was like Hey this stuff actually works no so and is there a defining moment when you knew you were you're going to be an herbalist or could call yourself an herbalist and is there like a moment that you remember that that this is what you're doing for your life because this is really what you've done for the majority of your life well I I yes there's and this again may you may not expect this I remember I mean I was already an herbal in retrospect I guess I was an herbalist uh especially back then but uh but I never but anyway I don't know where I was going but I was flying somewhere internationally and you know before the plane land there would come out of the hand you those immigration cards you know you have to fill out yeah yeah they used to do that name and and your and your passport you have to fill all this one and I was filling it out and it said occupation and now for years and years I put student it was said occupation and I thought a minute I said herbalist yeah as I wrote it in h e r b a l i s t and I was like and I self-proclaimed at that moment that and then when people say what do you do I said I'm an urbanist yeah of course you those what's that I know I always said like um I because I've always since I opened my herb store back in 1972 I would always say I'm an herbalist and I used to say that for many many years I'd be the least popular person in of the party right because everybody go like what's that and they they had nothing really to say about it but now if you say you're an herbalist you just get you start hearing about people's private lives and you know their personal illnesses right it's it's kind of amazing to see how you talk to a stranger on an airplane yes yeah says says what do you do you tell him you got the stage for the whole flight if you want I know yes but of course then you go and say but then they they roll up their sleeve and you go you see what's that a rash yeah can you cure that with herbs and I said well yeah you know what tumeric is you know well that actually leads me into a question do you have a favorite herbal story healing story that you want to share like the time that you really saw the herbs I know you've seen thousands of times I know that's one of the things about running that business for so long is and one of the motivators for you running it is that it you could see how a huge difference it made in people's lives but do you have one one story that you want to share that's like a favorite healing story yes I do uh and we go back to uh Tucson Arizona and that herb retreat with Dr Dr Christopher and uh again I was just frazzled I was frazzled this is about and and uh we started on a I think a Tuesday or something and uh and I was working 16 20 hours a day so finally anyway it was it's Saturday night and I'm thinking oh God you know Sunday there's no classes in the morning you know I get to sleep in you know finally I can sleep in I'm snoozed away and Sarah by the way Sarah and I weren't a couple of them but I because I was in charge of the whole thing I got the best room of the whole place I got the the camp directors thing and we had a fireplace and a because it was raining and the rooms were cold and damp and oh God and and we got a bunch of these half of the people that came about two-thirds of the people that came to this Retreat were mostly hippies and the other third were old Dr Christopher gruffy from Utah drove up in their Cadillacs you know the Mormon and uh and Mormons yes and so meanwhile they're freaking out because all the hippies are swimming nude in the pool and uh but but I I digress again so anyway I'm F I get to sleep in so about 6:30 in the morning somebody comes and W wakes me up what what 6 I'm sleeping the other day go Ed you gotta come quick man I think this guy's dying I go what oh Christ that's not good so I got to get dressed and uh and got to walk through the rain up this muddy Hill getting the guy and come into this room and I open the room and when I opened the door it stuck it just stuck so what it was it was this this young kid who's about 18 years old who was a Victor scho viscus raw food wheat grass groupy who had hitch sted all the way from Florida but but he had hitch sted for a day in the rain he was soaking wet when he came in uh he was exhausted he was skinny as a rail classic classic raw fooder who didn't know what he was doing skinny as hell and and uh and he and he's and he's bre and he's breathing like this which means his lungs were full of fluid right he had pneumonia oh dear yeah and I said oh my God bring it bring a car here quick we're going to take you to the emergency room and this kid beged please don't please don't take me to the LI he begging me begging me I said no man you you can die man we got to we got to go to the hospital he goes please don't take me and I looked at him I said I said look in my eyes I said how many fingers do I have he he had all the right answers I said look at my eyes I said if you don't do everything I tell you I don't care how bad it tastes I don't care how much it hurts if you don't do every single thing I tell you I'm going to throw you in the truck of the car and we're taking you to the emergency room so I did a I did a class Dr Samuel Thompson course of medicine yeah and I had learned this from my study in yoga and then know so I'm I'm making up a big hot tea of lobilia tea and uh and uh this kid is by the way his his sleeping bag was soaking wet from the sweaty yeah so I had to moved to my cabin where we had a a fireplace and and uh and stripped him down and uh and covered him up with blankets and I and I had him drink this little be he drank he took a half a sip oh this stuff's terrible I can't drink I said bring the car around he goes okay I'll drink it I'll drink it so he's drinking I had him drink a quart of Lilia tea and he said what do we do now I said just wait oh boy so anyway about 15 minutes later I'm I'm in the bathroom with him both of us on our knees I'm having him put his fing down I've got his vomit in my hands and he's going oh oh I can't do I said keep doing it stick your finger down your throat he goes no I can't I so I stick my I'm sticking my finger down his throat he's vomiting on my hand you know and then I after he got through empty his uh belly I gave him the famous composition powder oh yeah B it's Bayberry root bark uh Ginger cayenne pepper and I think some other herb these are the famous old formulas and we made a made a a c of piping hot composition powder tea and boy it's it's spicy and it'll make you sweat especially when you vomit somebody like that when that vagus nerve kicks in all your blood vessels just relax and and the circulation moves to the outer body because because that it's taking heat from the inner body and the heat from those lungs and bringing it to the surface and exp and letting go of the Heat so anyway I'm and I we I bought a a we got a bucket of hot water put his feet in the hot water with a bunch of ginger powder wrapped him up in a blanket you know and fed him fed him this tea whatever and he was sweating his sweat's just running down his face the blanket is getting wet from his sweat Ted capcher came in and we did an acupuncture treatment for him take him back in a car to his room they covered up in blankets I went back and he was breathing better and I and and I said that night that Dar I said is is the kid all right he said I said I want somebody who inv his de at all times do not leave him you can take shifts but do not leave him alone I went back after dinner and he was like he was bringing s he said I feel so much better so much better by the way by the way when he when nobody was looking I went to the bathroom got on my knees and said dear God please don't let this guy die please don't let this guy die you know and and all of the sudden i' read and samel Thompson's biography which is an incredible book to read Samuel Thompson in the 1700s yeah he was tried in Boston from murder because he one of his patients died from liilia but he didn't die from liilia he just died yes he happen to be so anyway but I did exactly what Thompson talked about in his and also the Back to Eden book talks about it also yes I did the exact I follow the the letter of the law we saved this guy's life yeah actually save this guy's life in in uh in a few hours so that that uh man I was uh I was bored again yeah that's a great story Ed you know and it's interesting it is those those are dramatic stories for certain but this is at a time when you know those old Elders like Samuel Thompson and you know Dr shik Etc I mean they were and Dr Christopher for certain I mean they were treating everything and they were some of those therapies sound really dramatic but they're really nothing compared to what the alpath medicine uses in years to come when I became more sophisticated and knew more about the chemistry of the herbs and the phac Dynamics and whatever and I and I studied the chemistry of liilia years later I actually understood scientifically rationally yeah why those why those herbs were working yes Absol Dr Christopher didn't know samel Thompson for sure didn't know but that doesn't mean it didn't work yeah he just he just didn't know what the pharmacology was no I know they yeah that's that's been an interesting step to really understand how these plants are doing in the their physiology and the body for certain but I also really appreciate it that people just when they discovered that something worked they just trusted that it worked you know it was great you know anded you've been talking a lot about these Elders who I know a lot of our listeners don't really know anymore and you have the great Good Fortune to study with so many of them but I'm wondering is there a teacher but one of these particular teachers that most influen your work one that inspired and helped you you know become the herbalist that you are well Dr Christopher was there of course but we've already talked to him about him there are two people uh a guy named Don sad Maro a Colombiano Iowa sko Kuro uh who lived in the pamaya uh region of Southern uh on the border of Ecuador in Colombia and uh I had heard I heard a lot about iasa never never done it and I wanted to try so had some friends had been to the Amazon there were two medical doctors from New York who uh who came down and did aaska for a while and live with us in the in the mushroom country and uh and so anyway I went I I uh I had this name Don salador Moreno and Don salador was a kurand Kur and espanol means to heal or cure he was a curer A Healer and iaso is somebody who knows about iasa and this was this was 40 some years ago now today you can go to there's all kinds of IAS you can go on IAS got trips and tours and they'll pick you up in the bus into your hotel it's all just it ain't it ain't that real so anyway so I W up going into the Faya Jungle by myself and I knew that Don Salvador supposedly Liv somewhere on the on the uh putaya so I spent a week actually almost two weeks in this jungle in these little Villages and uh living these you know and traveling really really lightly uh you know and uh so anyway I I would ask you do you know do you know a GU do you know Don noro no no no and I went up at this army camp in the middle of nowhere the there were there were a few roads that went through there were oil roads where the trucks that were working at the the oil rigs in the jungle there were these dirt dirt roads that was the only way you could travel through the jungle without without a boat so anyway I don't want to make this story too long I met this guy said oh Don Salvador Don Salvador is coming it was election day that's what it was an election day of this army base and somebody said Don Salvador is coming to to vote today really oh really really cool so anyway there was a truck going to down the road to this Market I I was run out of food I needed food so I got the truck I went to the market I came back about a half an hour later this guy comes up and where were you at man Don Salvador was here I told him you wanted to meet him I said where's he at where's well he's gone back home he came by can I said no no he said man you should have been here oh so I at this point I've got I'm I'm I've got you know diarrhea you know Teresa Mona's Revenge Deli belly Bol belly the shits the trots whatever you want to call it anyway I said well that's it I give up so it's election day so I I got out and I I got a ride to the next town it wasn't much of a town it was just a small little general store and a few houses and I got a a ride to there and then the sun was setting and and I said uh well uh maybe I can sleep there was a there's this little shed what I said maybe I can sleep here but there were but the the a bunch of drunk Colombians there drinking and drunk and getting all Roundy and and I was freaking I don't what the hell I was going to do and this woman comes by and she spoke some English and I between her English and my Spanish and she says well uh do you need somewhere to stay I said yes she said come with me so she took me home with her and kids and she goes what are you doing in the middle of this J whatever I said well I'm I was trying to be Don Sal Don salador moo but I'm giving up she goes I know Don Sal door really well he saved my kids lives oh really W and I said you know you know where he lives he goes yes I know where he lives and uh she says uh you sleep here tonight and uh at about 5: in the morning my son's going to wake you up and he's going to walk you down about a mile down the road where there's a bridge going over this River and and Don Salvador lives further up the river that's amazing okay so I get up next morning I go down to this uh to the road to the bridge and uh and there was a little Shack down you had to go down the this hill Steep Hill down to the river there's a little Shack there that some guy who work for the oil company was there and uh and I said do you know Don dooro he goes no and I said well uh his uh this lady the lady son said what tell he says well oh yeah I know what you're talking about so anyway I said to myself if if somebody comes from down river that can take me to Don Salvador I'm going to give them the canoe if the bus comes or the truck comes I'm going to get in the truck I'm going to go back to civilization okay that was a defining moment in your life it was a defining moment in my life and the and the river was covered with fog it was really early in the morning it was covered with fog and after about an hour I [Music] heard two cycle engine come and I go running down and I see this Dugout canoe with this guy this guy who had uh one arm his arm was amputated here and he let a couple of women off on the shore and I went running down I said do you know Dono goes see I said where does he live goes a a I said uh can you take me to see him he goes okay so I get in the boat and he turns around we start going down one of the most incredible trips of my life I mean we going we going shooting Rapids you know there's you're seeing anacondas hanging off the trees you're never seen so many butterflies in my life you know snakes uh unbelievable just beautiful millions of orchids you know and we're just going and we're we're on this boat for about two hour we get into these really heavy Rapids and he turned the motor off and just you know and I'm holding on for de wife pray we don't and we finally the river gets wider and deeper and still and we go about half an hour and he starts to go and and we come into a clearing and there these two thatch roof houses on the shore and then he goes donador donor lives here I said really he goes yes so anyway it's not like I sent him an email tell him I was going to show up you know you know I'm just I get off the boat and I said so uh I said so where do you go from there he goes I'm going here Don salador is my father and Don salador had had a dream about me had Don sador the night before it had a dream about me and he sent his son one I up said to get me so I went up spending a week with Don Salvador Moreno and doing the iasa doing with an i yes now I didn't learn a lot about different herbs from him but just being with him his breed is dying as you well know dying out yeah he was he was a kufan Indian the kufan Indians are almost gone so uh and uh so anyway I went up spending a week with him his his mother-in-law this old old woman she was so she was like my Jewish grandmother they put me and they said you can stay in the old house and put my hammock up and this whole woman she'd come up to me and she'd fil and go fle fle you're too skinny you're too skinny so I'd wake up I'd wake up in the morning there be all this fruit blow my hammock she goes eat eat eat so uh she took care of anyway so uh that night that the day came for the do the aaska and Don Salvador goes into the said going into the jungle to cook up the of course AAS bopis copy copy 2 a K is another uh Indian name for for y aasu or yah so uh so uh anyway but but the the the alkaloids that are in iasa when they were first isolated by a German in the 1800s they were called telepathine really that was the scientific name for the alkaloids in IAS was telepathine I didn't realiz it's called now it's called harmaline named after harmala the Hawaiian Roose uh so but but if you mix this this other plant which which he called the cion oh the comp compion the companion if you mix the two together the Harmony and alkaloids can't have a real can't get into the inner brain okay but if you miss it with the uh with the uh what's it called can't think of the name now anyway with this other herb uh it changes the ity of the alkaloids and they go into and they flood into the inner brain and they just knew that and how did they there are hundreds of thousands of plants to choose from how do they know that how did they figure that out how do you think knows I don't know Space men came through or psychically or knowing the plants the plants talking to us yes exactly so I saidwell I'm going to go with you to cook the to cook the uh Iowaska and he goes no you don't want to come with me said oh yes I do yes I do I do want to come he goes no no oh it's it's raining a lot I said that's okay I don't care I don't mind doing it I want to go with you he goes you don't want to go with me I went oh okay so anyway later that night I'll end the story soon here later that night he his wife had blocked the entrance to that the house is up about 12 feet above the ground because there's Jaguars and you know and wild animals or whatever and uh snakes and uh whatever so but uh she put a blanket over the front door now the walls only went up about halfway so anyway and then she put a step ladder up to one of the windows so he comes out from the jungle and he's got these he's got these bouquet of flowers or no this bouquet of berries and he had this big ceramic pot of IW te and he's coming in through the uh he's coming in through the uh the step ladder and as he's coming in putting his feet in he's taking that that that uh bouquet like his magic wand and he's shwing away The Ghost and the and the devils and stuff so they won't follow him into the room to make Mischief with the iasa yeah so uh and he steps into the room and uh and uh he's his wife has his hammock and he's sitting there in the hammock and uh his sister-in-law had paddled for two days to come be treated with him because she had really bad liver so she's there his kids are there his one armed son was there and he he uh he drank a lot of iasa Jesus Christ he and uh and uh finally he uh he sets up a little altar in the corner of the room just a board and he had these berries and he had the IAS and uh and he says uh it's time to do the aaska and he stood up and he he was this very gentle man but he went to that little altar and he took the berries and he painted there were red berries and he painted himself and then he grabb and and then he had these bouquet of ferns that were tied at the back of him and when he Shak it would go and so he starts off really slowly this he starts off really go hey hey hey and he's s and he's he's like dusting my AA hey [Music] and he's just and he gets louder and he becomes he turns from this simple little man to this incredible kand and it was unbelievable oh oh no that's why I drank the iwaska I forgot what thing I Dr Guy watch he waited about 20 minutes and he he leans over where I at he goes EST are you drunk are you drunk are you drunk other words are you stoned in the aaska and I said I said no no he gives you more and he goes and he goes uhhuh no he didn't give me more but he took he did his say and after he did that whole ceremony and singing and he's dancing around the floor he's dancing around me you know and oh oh and he would sweep my or and then he would go to the window he would throw it away like a like a dust M you Shake the Dust M so he go he shake it away and then he and he and he and he's sits back in his hammock and he leans over to him and goes EST EST now are you drunk and I said oh much and he goes that sounded Wicked it was wicked he's going oh you're Stone now brother you're mine now and uh oh we anyways his wife he did the the oral cleansing with his wife his sister his son he did this whole thing and uh but as you know aaska is very purgy very purgy but we're not going to talk about all the purging no no but vomiting although he he said uh I finally I said I can't hold it any long I got to leave so he said well you can go down by the river so they open the blanket for me and I'm I'm getting I'm going out the door trying to sh away all the the Devils or whatever I go to the uh River and I talk about a Medics I was vomiting but but I've been doing all this s Crea Yoga practices stomach cleansing nasal cleansing you know whatever so I was I used to teach classes in vomiting at the inal yoga Institute and uh so anyway I'm just the trick is you got to let it go so I want to know the experience afterwards well one I say but what I what I was hearing was I would it I could hear my echo sixer oh oh oh oh sound like a Jaguar dating call or something so anyway it was uh and by the way my my Trista my uh completely cured in 12 hours completely cured and that if that I've heard you tell this story many times actually I remember it back from the herb School you were telling it because it had such an incredible ible impact on you like I I know that working with this incredible Elder and the graciousness and then his power but I think again once again to to know that those herbs could transform somebody in such an amazing way right it just really impacted your world viiew I think oh Absolut well traveling in general yeah especially tra especially traveling before I I used to I used to live in a different we all live I used to travel in a very different world at a very different time I call it bpc PC computer oh personal computer I didn't get it I'm sorry the world was much much bigger then yes I couldn't be I couldn't be in the middle of the the S desert make a phone call so but but like I said but I didn't learn a lot about individual herbs from Don Salvador but I experienced something that was so ancient he he was singing songs that his father had taught him that his father had taught him his father taught him God knows how many generations going back probably hundreds of years and and and just being a part of that you know just and when I first met him by the way I told him I said I've heard I've heard about you I heard that you're you're you're very knowledgeable kand Ando I said I'm a young I'm a young healer just starting out and I'm coming to you because I want to I want to learn from you oh he he he liked that he liked that you know and I also think that you know one of the things that about Herb Farm that's really been impactful in the world is that it it is an amazingly successful business you and Sarah have created a but the success is also about the integrity and the intention behind the medicines and I think that these early experiences really inform the way that you did business because um yeah I know it's exciting to it was exciting to see that you know get that $300 and that $700 to see that you could actually earn a livelihood from this passion that you had but it went so beyond that you know it was more like changing the world through these medicines that you made and I I know that that was always part of your mission you know is changing the world through these medicines and I think that you know as you're telling these stories now I think that you know I'm really getting a picture of how impactful those early experiences were like you know being in the jungle and seeing the way that people lived and and your experiences working in that Seventh Day Adventist Hospital and the early experiences working with those Elders I mean they really informed you you know reshaped you probably right very much so very much so I I I I did I I didn't see it anywhere near as much as I see it now looking back at it yes of course yeah you know cuz I was in I couldn't see the trees cuz I was in the forest yeah no I couldn't see the forest cuz I was in the trees anyway that too even though I've known you for almost 50 years as I'm hearing these stories and also having seen the trajectory of this business and how it's impacted the whole herbal industry and healing in general I'm realizing you know once again I I've heard this in so many of the stories that our elders are telling us it was that direct relationship with the earth and the plants really being involved it wasn't so much what we were learning in our heads it was more these experiences that were rooting us down so that when we went back out into the world were sharing from a very deeply rooted um impassion place so yeah yeah and that means me I think I know the answer to this but I'm I'm just I love always love hearing you know like if you were talking about your favorite plant allies like those plants that just show up for you I have a feeling what you're going to say but so far you've been answering very differently so I'm just curious do you have any particular plant allies that you know always show up for you that are there I think I do know your answer uh might I might have a few to get on my top 10 list first of all you got to be readily available you got to be growing in my backyard or pretty close to it okay I mean I mean I love exotic herbs from far away places yes you do but I'm talking about St John's word uh Yaro plantain you know herbs herbs that are that are readily available that have been used for centuries and centuries and and things like well St John's word herbs herbs that are uh One-Stop shopping so to speak they're very versatile they're very broad spectrum in terms of what you can use them for St John's words can be used for irritated bladder it can be used for nerve pain you know uh there's just so many things it can be used for yl it's a stringent you can use it for tighten it tightening the uh the bows for for diarrhea you can drink it really hot it'll make you sweat you drink it room temperature it's a diuretic uh it makes a great Sav you know it goes on and on and on and plantain uh can I tell you a quick can I tell you a quick story about plantain I love your stories please I'm in New York City going to kill's Pharmacy you know which is long since gone they sold out to whatever but but but it was I used to love to go to kill's Pharmacy and just look at the people that walk they used to be these Dominican mint wives you know and and Russian herbalist and whatever you know just listen and uh and they knew the herbs and all these different names but this is a this is a telling me this is this is where I was really starting out I went into kill's Pharmacy and I said do you have eonia well you know what Stephen you know what Stephen Foster said if you don't know the name how to pronounce it just say it first yeah well so anyway the guy the guy just goes he says do you mean eoni I said yeah that's what I mean so so but anyway I'm uh I'm in New York City I'm crossing a a really wide Street in the traffic and I and the light turns red on me so I start running for the other side because the cars aren't going to stop you know this there's like they've got you know they're speeding up so I make a leap for the sidewalk on the other side of this intersection and the curb was really tall and I was wearing Birkin Su and I bludgeon my right big toe right into the P boom and I knew oh oh man and it really hurt for about 20 seconds then it stopped hurting well I knew what that meant it means about an hour it's going to every heartbeat you're going to feel on your toe yeah and I said well it'll be okay so I started walking and you remember how Burak is built well after a while my my my foot is slashing in blood that burot was filling up with blood so I thought well what can I do what can I do and I thought I was and I was one block away from Central Park so I walked into the Central Park and I looked around and I looked around for a big shade tree cuz plantain likes to grow in a shade I see a big shade tree and there was a water fountain I said oh water fountain shade tree and I went there and of course where people drinking the there's a lot of water spilled on the ground and there were these big huge broadleaf plantains oh yeah Broad Leaf you know and uh and I picked them I picked them and I washed them off in this in this Fountain and I went off some and I cleaned my foot of the blood and I uh I took some of the uh some of the plantain and I broke them off if you break them off really carefully I like to do this where you people could see it you can pull and you can get these long I call it herbal dental floss you can floss your those what's another name for plantain rib wart yes those little rib those little ribs in the stem if you break it and pull them up whatever you can get little strings like that and you can actually floss your teeth with them so anyway I I took a couple of leaves and I chewed them up into a green mass and I I spread that toe apart where the toe had actually burst didn't cut it burst and I uh I squeez the juice into it the bleeding stopped almost instantly it already slowed down but it stopped instantly and then I took the rest of that pulp and I packed it around that toe and then I took a couple of the biggest leaves and I F them and I wrapped them around the toe and then I took those strings and I tied them oh I tied great and the next morning when I woke up and I took the I took it off that wound was completely sealed shut yeah completely SE shut yeah quite amazing I think we all have those plantain Miracle stories don't we it's it's like the famous boo boo plant for certain and I I hate to say you know our time is running out I know time just flies you know and you are such a Storyteller as I said you know you I know you have a zillion stories to to share but you know I did want to ask you you know what in what in your work as an herbalist you've done so much you know both for the industry and just herbalism in general but what you feel has been your greatest accomplishment and that you're most proud of well the short answer is farm and uh you know I mean I Shar and I started it in our kitchen literally I never dreamed it would ever I I started the Earth Farm because I didn't I as I used to joke Sarah and I were twoo hippies who didn't want to get a job we didn't mind working we just didn't want to work for the man yes yeah little did I realize I would become the man someday but uh but but anyway we just uh we were and it just snowed boled and just and so not only just Herb Farm per se but the farm that we've created the along with United PL was a propagation of of all the work we done and there now there are books but when we started there were no books on how to grow wild herbs there were no books so we figured it out by trial and there some of them some we had some we had great success some we didn't some it took us took us four years to finally figure out how to grow a really good crop of eon uh so that work also the intern program we used to call it the Apprentice program one day my insurance agent told me said you know what if if if you don't call an apprentices I can save you about 50% on your uh your uh your liability insurance I said they're not they're not they're they're interns he goes yeah that's good they're interns which is actually more realistic than what they are actually are they're interns yes I'm really proud of that program because we did it since day one which is one of the lessons I learned from Dr Dr an wingmore is free labor although although you although you do pay you do pay but uh but anyway we started off with intern program and it grew and grew and grew I'd love to just say something about that inter program you know it was really like the Cadillac of the programs it was yes people worked really hard when they were in that but it was like getting the most amazing free education and I think every aspiring herbalist wanted to be an intern at Herb Farm so yeah well we're not a show Farm we're not a show Farm we're a working farm yes it's it's beautiful the Landscaping you know and whatever there's a lot of art artistic art has going into the the planet how it physically looks or whatever but it's a working Herb Farm we're picking herbs we're making medicine and uh you know and so there's no better place in the world to have an herb herb Retreat or or an herb apprenti ship or all call it the herbal Mecca you know it's kind of the herbal heaven on Earth it's truly a magnificent place um well I call it the farm farm what do you call it the farm farm the far yes the farm farm and you know what we call you know what we call the building where we make the medicines no the plant plant that's pretty perfect yeah well you have you have uh really created quite a legacy you know that that Herb Farm and then the products and the business and then also I want to share that you know I mentioned this earlier but with United plant Savers your and Sarah's support Herb Farm support was really one of the things that helped get United plant Savers off the ground and also you your company was one of the first there were a few companies that immediately jumped in and said yes this is a problem and we want to be the solution where many of the companies in the herb industry was very worried about the voice of United plant Savers in the beginning but Herb Farm recognized there was a problem and recognized that as put LS that we were in the prime position to make a difference so I just really want to shout out that uh you know for your support and Herb Farm and Sarah support it's been really really excellent so Ed do you have any final message that you want to leave to the other plant lovers to the world before we close well uh yes I do very quickly as I said earlier when I started out there there were no herb schools or only one there were very few herb books now fast forward to the day and don't take this wrong cuz I'm I'm going to redeem myself there are to there are too many herb schools there are too many herb books or too many herb classes or too many herb Retreats there too many people claiming to be herbalists oh not just herbalist but Master herbalist yeah can you imagine being a master plumber by studying for three months so uh so anyway take advantage of all of it but don't buy any of it right away just take it in you know uh there's a lot of misinformation out there there's a lot of great information that out there but when you're first starting out you may not be knowledgeable enough to distinguish what's good and what's bad but number one if you if you want to be an herbalist if you really want to truly be an herbalist you got to hang out with the plants yeah that's the message you got to hang out with the herbs you got to you know you got to know what plantain looks in January what does it look like in January what does it look like when it's first popping out of the ground in the spring what does it look like when the seed pods are forming you know what does it taste like what does it smell like what does it feel like what's it like when it dries is it really brittle and crackly when it dries or is it spongy like PL you know like mull Leaf you know whatever uh you got to learn the plants themselves because that's what the when we talk about the herbal said didn't know about the chemistry they didn't know about the physiology they didn't know about that but what did they know about they knew about the herbs they knew about the plants they knew about the plants cuz they touched them every day they smelled them they walked into a room and they could smell them they knew what the plain looks like in the in the middle of the winter you got to hang out with the plants and you got to hang out with Mother Nature and and there's a lot to be learned there not not necessarily knowledge that you can write on a piece of paper but uh I like to just go out through the herb garden I mean what we call the Botanical education Garden at uh at Herb Farm that's that's my church that's my church that's where I go you know I like to sit down in the in the among the herbs water and just close my eyes and listen to the waterfall and you know and just take it in there's there's knowledge happening there
