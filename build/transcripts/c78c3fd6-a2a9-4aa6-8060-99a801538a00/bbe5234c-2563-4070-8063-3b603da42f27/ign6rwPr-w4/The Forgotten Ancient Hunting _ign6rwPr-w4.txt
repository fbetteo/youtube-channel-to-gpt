How did this forgotten ancient weapon allow people to hunt for generations? The primitive tool known as the bolasp typically consisted of two or three weights tied together with a sturdy rope, making it easy to carry. When swung overhead and released, it would wrap around the limbs of prey or an enemy, instantly immobilizing them and making capture far easier.
