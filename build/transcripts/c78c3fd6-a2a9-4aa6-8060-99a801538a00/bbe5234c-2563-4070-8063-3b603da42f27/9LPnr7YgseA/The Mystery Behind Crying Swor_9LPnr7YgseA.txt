Why do some ancient swords make such a loud noise? These so-called crying swords or singing swords had grooved or wavy blades that made the air vibrate when swung, creating a high-pitched sound during combat. This sound instilled fear in enemies, created psychological pressure, and helped the wielder stand out on the battlefield. Legends say some swords cried out in regret for the blood they spilled.
