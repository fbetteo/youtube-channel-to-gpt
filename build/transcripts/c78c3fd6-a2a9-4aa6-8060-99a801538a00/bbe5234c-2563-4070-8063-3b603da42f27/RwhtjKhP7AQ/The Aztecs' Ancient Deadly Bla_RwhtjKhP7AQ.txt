Was the ancient Aztec weapon more effective than a sword? Though far from iron and steel, the Aztecs wielded the Mchua Whitel, a deadly weapon made of razor sharp, brittle obsidian that shattered rather than sliced. When the blades broke on impact, they caused severe injuries, making it easier to capture enemies. As effective as it was, its fragile design required constant replacement.
