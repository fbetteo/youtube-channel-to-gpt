Why is this man continuing the brutal 3,000-year-old tradition of his ancestors? This ancient method known as blowpipe heat treatment was used to achieve high and controlled temperatures in stone and metalwork. It requires great effort and exertion as oxygen is supplied to the fire by blowing into a pipe for hours. This allows high heat without increasing fuel, creating a multi-billion dollar stoneworking industry.
