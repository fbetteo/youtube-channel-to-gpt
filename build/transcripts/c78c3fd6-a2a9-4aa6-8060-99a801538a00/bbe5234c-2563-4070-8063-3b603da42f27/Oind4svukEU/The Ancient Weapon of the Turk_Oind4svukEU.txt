The Turks used these ancient whistling arrows for a unique purpose in battle. With their hollow tips, they produced a high-pitched scream-like whistle when fired, striking fear into the enemy and creating psychological pressure before the fight even began. Metehan used them to quickly signal his troops and help them follow his lead, gaining a significant tactical advantage.
