How could the ancient Greeks throw such deadly darts so far? This long range armor-piercing weapon was called the Kestros, dating back to the 2nd century BC. It launched specially crafted darts with surprising force. A braided rope with a small opening or cradle in the center held the dart in place by swinging it rapidly and releasing one end. The dart was launched with high spin and force, allowing it to fly farther and pierce through armor.
