[00:16] welcome back for another video this is
[00:18] Mark and I'm going to bring you to Japan
[00:19] where I spent two weeks with my wife uh
[00:22] but I've also been busy I'm going to
[00:23] share with you uh two updates that I
[00:25] made on my product and software I'm also
[00:26] going to share transparently every
[00:28] Revenue that I got from my seven
[00:30] products I'm going to talk about a new
[00:32] book that I read this month that changed
[00:34] the way I work and how I'm able to
[00:36] produce more while working a little bit
[00:38] less and I am going to show you how my
[00:41] server got hacked and I end up having a
[00:44] massive bill that I still have to pay
[00:46] and I don't know how to fix this and
[00:47] finally a little reflection on how I
[00:49] grow this YouTube channel from 0 to
[00:51] 45,000 subscribers in 4 month all right
[00:54] let's go
[00:56] [Music]
[01:04] [Applause]
[01:05] [Music]
[01:13] I added a new feature to my code bow
[01:15] plate ship fast I wanted to bring some
[01:18] gamification elements to the process of
[01:20] building startups to help people stay
[01:21] motivated on the long term and so now
[01:24] makers of ship fast can compete for the
[01:25] ship fast leaderboards the leaderboard
[01:27] will ring project made with ship fast
[01:29] based on their actual Revenue there are
[01:31] two leader boards an alltime high where
[01:33] I chose the entire Revenue since the
[01:35] person got started and another one for
[01:37] the current month to make sure that
[01:38] newcomers have a chance to rank on those
[01:40] leaderboards the links on the
[01:41] leaderboard are clickable so hopefully
[01:43] that brings a little extra traffic to
[01:45] the projects that are featured so ship
[01:47] fast maker can log into to their account
[01:49] and there are a few things that they can
[01:50] polish like they can change their
[01:51] profile picture name and Twitter handle
[01:54] and then makers can add as many startups
[01:56] as they want and handle which one are
[01:58] shown on the leaderboard this is an
[01:59] addition to the current Discord
[02:01] community and I hope this helps make
[02:02] your stay motivated and show up every
[02:11] day oh it's
[02:14] shaky
[02:16] [Music]
[02:21] [Music]
[02:25] noow oh wow in Japan this pool
[02:32] [Music]
[02:39] I also added a new feature on my tiny
[02:41] software called poop up poop up is a
[02:43] little marketing tool that users use to
[02:45] increase their website conversion rate
[02:46] they will show a popup notification to
[02:48] know they either understand the problem
[02:51] of their customers or to show some time
[02:53] sensitive notifications like a discount
[02:55] coupon that's available only for a few
[02:57] hours I use a feedback collection tool
[02:59] called p in order to understand what
[03:01] customers want from the product
[03:03] customers can create features requests
[03:05] and also upvote other feature requests
[03:07] and every week I will open the candy
[03:09] board and just see which feature is the
[03:11] most requested and people ask for
[03:13] clickable popups so I implemented the
[03:15] feature basically now all those pop-up
[03:17] notifications can be clicked and they
[03:19] will open a new tab and R ring to any
[03:21] link the customer wants
[03:26] [Music]
[03:47] okay now the not so fun part update for
[03:50] this month um one of my servers got
[03:52] attacked I believe it's denial or
[03:54] service attack so it happened on AWS I'm
[03:56] using two uh services from Amazon the
[04:00] bucket where I put basically all my uh
[04:02] images and videos from my website as
[04:04] well as AWS Cloud front uh basically a
[04:06] CDN so that images and videos would load
[04:09] faster and I realized this month that
[04:11] the bills for the previous month wor
[04:12] about
[04:13] $2,000 which is really strange CU I
[04:15] usually spend somewhere from $5 to $50
[04:18] per month so I knew something was wrong
[04:20] and so when I checked the cloud fronts
[04:21] usage I saw that there are three weird
[04:24] spikes of traffic I think about over 10
[04:26] terabytes of data were transferred which
[04:29] is really weird because um my website
[04:31] would get somewhere from 2 to 5,000
[04:33] visitors per day but we're far away from
[04:36] those 10 tabt of data so I reach out to
[04:39] the AWS support and it's still ongoing
[04:41] but it looks like they are first they're
[04:44] very friendly and it looks like they're
[04:45] going to remove those spikes and just
[04:47] build me as I would typically on a
[04:49] normal month I also posted that story on
[04:51] Twitter and I was amazed to see that 90%
[04:54] of the comments would mention Cloud
[04:55] flare to solve these kind of things I
[04:57] didn't want to change my text tack so I
[04:59] chose the simpler version so I turn on
[05:01] AWS W it's a firewall that should
[05:03] prevent these kind of attacks to happen
[05:05] again and so far it seems like it's
[05:07] working pretty
[05:08] [Music]
[05:28] well and B home in my house in B let's
[05:31] talk about finances in April 2024 I
[05:34] earned
[05:35] $143,200 let's break down some of the
[05:38] revenue streams a really good chunk of
[05:39] my revenue is coming from ship fast my B
[05:42] plate for developers to launch startups
[05:43] faster it was around 40 to 80,000 per
[05:46] month uh since the launch 8 months ago
[05:48] and this month it almost doubled it's
[05:50] also a good month for my software like
[05:52] bu disputes Zenvo and Indie page it made
[05:55] almost $6,000 this month and I'm really
[05:58] happy with it as I'm working on a very
[05:59] big project at the moment they are not
[06:01] growing as fast as I wish they would but
[06:03] as soon as I'm done with that I'm going
[06:04] to spend much more time on it especially
[06:06] on Indie page for which I have bit
[06:08] projects by the way you can check all
[06:09] the projects I'm talking about with a
[06:11] link to all my startups in description
[06:13] and I also made about 2,000 in YouTube
[06:16] and Twitter Revenue money in Money out
[06:18] let's talk about expenses I spent about
[06:21] 13,000 this month uh to run the business
[06:23] so there is about 500ish us for the tech
[06:26] stack about $2,000 for outsourcing some
[06:28] tasks like the video editing and $6,000
[06:31] for marketing so affiliation and ads are
[06:33] the only two channels I spend money on
[06:35] and finally I spent 5,000 for stripe the
[06:38] payment processing platform I use to
[06:39] accept credit cards on all my websites
[06:41] so that makes me around
[06:43] $130,000 in profit for this month this
[06:46] is absolutely insane uh if you've been
[06:48] following me for a while you know that
[06:50] I've been calling ads for about 6 years
[06:53] now and I've been earning like peanuts
[06:55] for such a long time like almost
[06:57] literally 5 years making somewhere from
[06:59] Z
[07:00] to one or2 to $3,000 per month my wife
[07:03] and I have been living like cockroaches
[07:04] for 5 years or so um I would say no to
[07:07] dinner with friends because I couldn't
[07:08] afford it I borrowed money from my
[07:11] parents to pay for this Villa if you go
[07:13] back in time on my Twitter account you
[07:15] see that every month I still share the
[07:17] exact Revenue I earn and you could see
[07:19] that the past the two years prior to
[07:22] that I would earn nothing from1 to
[07:25] $1,000 per month and what's happening
[07:27] this month and the previous eight month
[07:29] have been absolutely insane and I'm just
[07:31] so happy I stuck with doing what I'm
[07:34] doing showing up daily and not quitting
[07:36] I know how hard it is to keep pushing
[07:38] when nothing really is happening but I
[07:40] promise you if you do it something will
[07:42] happen because this is my story I don't
[07:44] have any particular skills I'm not uh
[07:47] especially smart I don't have business
[07:49] friends who know everything about
[07:50] entrepreneurship I just did the things
[07:53] that I wanted to do code apps for long
[07:55] enough until luck F me and if I can do
[07:58] it you can do it too
[08:00] [Music]
[08:19] every day I try to read about 15 minutes
[08:21] and I usually finish one book per month
[08:23] and this month I was reading deep work
[08:25] by Kyle Newport the book is really good
[08:28] it's not crazy amazing but it's a really
[08:30] good reminder that we live in a world of
[08:33] distractions and this is definitely not
[08:35] helping us produce the things we want to
[08:37] produce I try to have a working habit
[08:39] where I focus on the important tasks
[08:41] first and then later on the day I will
[08:44] go online and the book was really
[08:46] helpful to be even more religious about
[08:48] that and so now I'm even more extreme in
[08:52] my uh work style where I don't go online
[08:54] before 400 p.m. so it means my phone is
[08:57] off and I don't check emails Twitter
[08:59] YouTube or anything else before that and
[09:01] I realized that those four to five hours
[09:03] of undistracted work I get every day are
[09:06] very very productive if you find
[09:07] yourself checking your phone a little
[09:09] bit too much I really recommend you
[09:10] reading the book I'll share somewhere
[09:12] around here the notes I took when I read
[09:14] the book
[09:26] [Music]
[09:36] [Music]
[09:45] I started this YouTube channel four
[09:46] months ago in the first week of January
[09:49] 2024 it was actually part of a New Year
[09:52] resolution and so every Sunday I would
[09:54] go to my desk and just make whatever it
[09:56] is one video I did that for a month and
[09:58] nothing was really happening and then
[10:00] about a month ago YouTube decided to
[10:02] pick some of my videos and pop them out
[10:04] and my channel went from a couple
[10:06] thousand subscribers to what it is now I
[10:08] think around 45,000 subscribers I feel
[10:11] like when I really want something and I
[10:13] create some kind of habit that I do
[10:15] consistently something will happen for
[10:17] instance I started a news lator in
[10:19] August 2023 I would write whatever I
[10:22] learned during the journey and I would
[10:23] spend 4 hours every Saturday sending
[10:25] that newsletter I almost didn't skip
[10:27] every single Saturday and I I've been
[10:29] sending I think well over 30 issues
[10:32] right now and there are almost 20,000
[10:34] readers on the newsletter and the same
[10:36] thing happens for my daily life as well
[10:38] a couple years ago I was not in my best
[10:40] physical shape ever and I decided to
[10:42] start working out every single day I've
[10:44] done that for years and even though I am
[10:46] not a bodybuilder I feel fit and healthy
[10:48] and that's the win off for me and now I
[10:50] built this identity of a guy who has to
[10:53] work out every day who has to write a
[10:55] newsleter issue on Saturday who has to
[10:57] make a YouTube video on Sunday and it's
[10:58] very hard to give up those habits I
[11:00] really believe there is some kind of
[11:02] powerful force that rewards people who
[11:04] show up consistently and don't give up
[11:06] and it's probably thanks to this force
[11:07] that I'm able to talk to you through
[11:08] this YouTube video by the way I am very
[11:10] grateful for the attention you gave me
[11:12] uh through those YouTube videos that
[11:13] makes me feel like I'm not some kind of
[11:15] Weirdo And I would like to thank you in
[11:17] Japanese
[11:19] Aras all right until the next video I
[11:21] hope you just ship it
[11:23] [Music]
[11:24] cheers wow we're driving in Japan for
[11:27] the first time we
[11:42] [Music]
