[00:00] AI is getting so good it's scary I think
[00:02] I wrote less than 10% off the code it's
[00:05] time to go New Zealand wow has finally
[00:07] reached a th000 in monthly recording
[00:09] Revenue yes keep creating keep learning
[00:12] because the future is bright bringing
[00:14] the startup office around the world this
[00:16] is absolutely
[00:20] mindblowing meet Mark Lou a millionaire
[00:23] who owns exactly zero pairs of shoes and
[00:26] way more startups than you'd think is
[00:28] reasonable he sits here in this
[00:30] disgustingly beautiful Tropical Paradise
[00:33] to show you how to turn ideas into
[00:35] Brands strangers into clients and your
[00:38] boring job into a distant
[00:41] [Music]
[00:51] memory okay it's quite early in the
[00:53] morning and I just finished this course
[00:56] by Justin Welsh uh if you don't know him
[00:59] he's very very active on Twitter and
[01:00] Linkedin he has over a million followers
[01:03] on those platforms been inspired by the
[01:05] way he writes on Twitter to write my own
[01:08] tweets and around
[01:09] 2022 2023 after discovering his account
[01:13] and applying what he was doing my
[01:14] Twitter following started to uh grow
[01:17] much faster than it used to be and I got
[01:19] busy and distracted and it took me like
[01:21] more than a year to purchase this course
[01:24] the course is amazing it is exactly what
[01:26] you would expect from Justin Welsh it is
[01:28] perfect if you have any intention to um
[01:31] create anything on the internet and you
[01:33] need to share your thoughts with text
[01:36] the course I bought is called the
[01:37] content OS so it's going to teach you
[01:40] how to come up with a bunch of ideas and
[01:42] how to format those ideas into like a
[01:45] great packaging something that is
[01:47] pleasurable and easy to read and now my
[01:49] problem is that I have so many ideas
[01:52] that I'm going to dedicate an entire 30
[01:54] minutes time slots per day to writing so
[01:57] check out Justin Welsh course it is
[01:59] really great I will add a link somewhere
[02:01] around this video uh this is not an
[02:03] affiliate program I just really loved
[02:05] the course and I really recommend you to
[02:06] have a look now it's time to
[02:08] [Music]
[02:15] write this is such a crazy story I have
[02:18] to show you this okay so this person
[02:20] back here was one of the first beta
[02:23] testers for the course code fast and I
[02:26] remember back then he was asking CHP to
[02:28] build components and trying to piece
[02:30] everything together usually when you do
[02:31] that it's pretty hard to actually build
[02:33] an entire software and I remember when
[02:36] we started uh the beta student part of
[02:38] code fast we went back to the very basic
[02:40] learning the fundamentals of the
[02:42] internet and then the basics like react
[02:44] Tailwind CSS Etc and at the same time
[02:46] back here had a full-time job so he was
[02:49] just studying part-time and he showed up
[02:51] every single day and sometimes it was
[02:53] really hard because learning to code is
[02:55] not the easiest thing to do in the world
[02:56] but he still showed up almost every
[02:58] single day and then somehow with the
[03:00] skills that he earned during the course
[03:02] he was able to build a project and
[03:04] softwares that gave him the opportunity
[03:06] to work for a company as a freelancer to
[03:09] make a project which he was paid
[03:12] $60,000 for that project I think this is
[03:15] a very beautiful lesson about not giving
[03:18] up once and also that sometimes you
[03:21] don't know what is going to happen but
[03:23] if you do something something unexpected
[03:26] positive can happen so just keep
[03:28] creating keep learning because the
[03:30] future is
[03:32] [Music]
[03:45] [Laughter]
[03:47] [Music]
[03:50] bright 4 minutes 4 minutes okay have
[03:53] your computer my clothes and of course
[03:56] bringing the startup office around the
[03:58] world we're getting a world world tour
[04:00] at the moment that sounds crazy but it
[04:01] is true we are living Bal and uh we're
[04:03] looking for a new home we're doing like
[04:05] house shopping so we're going to start
[04:06] with New Zealand and then we going to go
[04:08] to Japan Korea probably India then we're
[04:11] going to slowly go back to Europe and
[04:13] then hopefully we're going to end the
[04:14] year with Canada USA and South America
[04:17] we have no idea that there's no concrete
[04:19] plan yet we'll go where we treed best
[04:21] we're just going to be slow mads like
[04:23] finding places where you know it's chill
[04:25] we're going to stay a week two weeks
[04:26] sometimes even maybe a month or more if
[04:28] we like it it's time to to good New
[04:30] Zealand hello
[04:35] [Music]
[04:58] [Music]
[05:11] I'm if you're filming this can you
[05:13] please turn your camera off thank
[05:19] you the is turned off also be careful
[05:24] thank you byebye we made it we freaking
[05:27] made it yeah yeah we were live
[05:31] [Music]
[05:44] we finally made it here to Mona New
[05:47] Zealand after a 24 hours long trip we
[05:50] have one our plane that was cancelled so
[05:52] we were moved to the next one and then
[05:54] the plane to come here to the South New
[05:56] Zealand we thought we would almost die
[05:57] in the plane then we had the car rid and
[05:59] everything and anyway we ended up being
[06:01] in this place for 2 weeks so I just
[06:02] finished the morning workouts now it's
[06:04] breakfast time and after that I'm going
[06:06] to go for I don't know four 3 four hours
[06:08] of deep work and then with my wife we're
[06:11] going to visit a little bit what New
[06:12] Zealand is all
[06:16] [Music]
[06:21] about and this AI thing is absolutely
[06:24] crazy so I am making a little change log
[06:28] for data so I want to have a Le least of
[06:30] all the previous updates I've shipped
[06:32] somewhere ranked on Google for uh just
[06:34] for backlog maybe even for SE juice and
[06:37] for people who are using the app just to
[06:39] show that the app is being updated
[06:41] recently and consistently I literally
[06:43] ask my AI agents to do all the work for
[06:46] me I use the composer feature on cursor
[06:49] and then I use the mode right here
[06:52] agents and then I describe exactly what
[06:54] I want and then he end up making this
[06:57] change log right here where I have an
[06:59] entire p so it's available at/ Chang log
[07:02] then I have all the previous changes
[07:04] I've made on my app with a date title
[07:06] and a photo the photo is extracted from
[07:08] the video I make to present the new
[07:10] feature and so if I look at the mo the
[07:12] one I shipped in a couple days ago this
[07:13] is marked down so I don't even have to
[07:16] style I just write markdown stuff and
[07:18] then boom I have a a beautiful page I
[07:20] have the demo video right here I have a
[07:22] little promotion that I design also for
[07:24] um well the software itself and at the
[07:26] same time I am using this markdown
[07:28] template on the main main dashboard of
[07:30] data fast to show this little thing
[07:32] right here at the bottom a little uh
[07:34] widget popup that if people click it
[07:37] shows the exact same markdown I have in
[07:39] my change log the crazy part here is
[07:42] that I barely didn't even code this is
[07:45] what's driving me insane these days with
[07:47] AI since I have a code base and I
[07:49] already have some components I just say
[07:52] what I want and it's going to make a
[07:53] beautiful design based on my previous
[07:55] designs and I just write English this is
[07:57] just mad it's crazy I cannot help but
[07:59] think about what is going to be in the
[08:01] future what a developer can do with
[08:04] tools like AI that can code design maybe
[08:06] even do marketing at some points or at
[08:08] least come up with creative angles for
[08:09] marketing that makes the entire process
[08:11] of creating something on the Internet
[08:13] much simpler which is good and bad
[08:15] because at the same time there will be
[08:16] much more competitions I'm just an
[08:18] observer here and this is absolutely
[08:20] mind-blowing if you haven't tried try
[08:22] the cursor agent this is
[08:25] phenomenal after a long day of work
[08:27] there's nothing better than jumping into
[08:29] cold
[08:30] [Music]
[08:52] reader how was it it's freezing but it's
[08:56] still good
[09:00] [Music]
[09:04] are you going to try no welome to
[09:09] new look at this
[09:12] monkey one
[09:15] two three I was the back fet
[09:19] [Music]
[09:31] wow he a human
[09:36] [Music]
[09:40] monkey good
[09:46] yeah this is our dream
[09:52] house oh you're very so you're old so
[09:55] cute so so cute love those shitty belly
[09:59] dogs mhm almost each every time they
[10:01] they see
[10:07] [Music]
[10:16] you prepare by the way
[10:23] my okay I have a good news and a bad
[10:25] news the good news is that DFAS finally
[10:28] reached a th000 in monthly recurring
[10:30] Revenue yes so this is what the data
[10:33] fast dashboard looks like the revenue
[10:36] overall is up about 10 to 15% month of a
[10:38] month and in terms of monthly recurring
[10:40] Revenue it is now four digits it's
[10:42] growing steadily every month it's pretty
[10:44] slow but it's growing steadily there are
[10:46] now 100 active subscribers so people who
[10:48] have their credit cards and are paying
[10:49] every month to use the service thank you
[10:51] that means a lot at the moment there is
[10:52] about 133% turn rate which is not great
[10:56] but also not bad I think and now it's
[10:58] quite steady so I think the promise I
[11:00] make on The Lending page and what the
[11:02] product delivers is kind of aligned the
[11:04] bad news is that there is some sort of a
[11:06] time bomb in my app um if you can see
[11:08] this is my cluster right here where uh I
[11:10] store all the data the page views and
[11:12] the events Etc uh the dis is already at
[11:15] 150 gab which is uh significant not
[11:19] massive but significant and the thing is
[11:21] the build keeps going up and up and up
[11:23] and up and now it cost me around 60% of
[11:26] the revenue just for the database I will
[11:29] have to find a way to reduce this usage
[11:32] because I might be losing money if I
[11:34] keep having the same structure here I
[11:35] think this is some kind of Advent Mong
[11:37] to be um Tech thing here and I would
[11:40] love to have someone who is an expert
[11:41] eye on it so if that's the case uh there
[11:43] will be a link below this video if you
[11:45] can just apply and uh because I am too
[11:47] much of a developer in my head I collect
[11:50] feedback from my software using this
[11:51] little uh custom made tool where people
[11:53] can up vote and suggest features I added
[11:55] this little thing here to hopefully make
[11:57] the more engagement in the comments
[11:59] people can just uh add likes to replies
[12:01] and that would help me as a business
[12:02] owner know what they exactly want I also
[12:04] changed the algorithm so it gives more
[12:06] priority to post that were made recently
[12:09] with a votes that were made recently as
[12:11] well hopefully it creates some kind of
[12:13] like Dynamic feed of what people want at
[12:15] the moments so I can build the right
[12:16] feature for
[12:23] them it's chicken bro seriously it's
[12:26] chicken ah come here
[12:29] I me you don't pet the
[12:33] chicken I think this is the weakest cat
[12:36] I've ever seen he's like oh this skin is
[12:38] too chewy for
[12:42] me it's so fun okay literally there's no
[12:46] sign of boundaries here yeah the kitchen
[12:48] is there the bathroom is at the bottom
[12:50] of the corridor JavaScript
[12:56] [Music]
[13:01] I think I'm going to go for the
[13:04] [Music]
[13:15] yellow oh I'll go
[13:21] then what's your favorites this or
[13:23] making YouTube thumbnails
[13:26] this I don't like thinking I I just like
[13:29] [Music]
[13:31] doing AI is getting so good it's scary
[13:35] uh this is one of my website ship fast
[13:38] and I have this little uh widget here
[13:40] that is embedded this is not from ship
[13:42] fast it's coming from my web analytics
[13:43] software data fast where I created this
[13:45] entire new uh feature called widget
[13:48] using AI so basically anyone who tracks
[13:50] analytics with datafast will get access
[13:52] to a little uh piece of code that they
[13:53] can embed to any website and it will
[13:55] display like this little cards here that
[13:58] make some of their web analytics public
[14:00] they can uh customize some options like
[14:02] colors light or dark theme uh there are
[14:04] some options and it's crazy that I think
[14:07] I wrote less than 10% of the code I'm
[14:09] using again the cursor AI composer this
[14:12] AI thing is making me so productive as a
[14:15] developer and now I can spend more time
[14:17] on other side that are important like
[14:19] marketing for instance now we are early
[14:21] 2025 I am so curious to what is going to
[14:24] happen in just one
[14:27] year the first Meetup was a month ago
[14:30] 12,000 km away from here and now we're
[14:34] having a new Meetup in Wan New Zealand
[14:36] This truly is a worldwide
[14:38] community and also it's a very tiny town
[14:41] here compared to Paris and still there
[14:42] are eight people who registered and it's
[14:44] going to be one of the most beautiful
[14:45] scenery we've ever had I
[14:48] [Music]
[14:55] guess 5 minutes before the Meetup start
[14:58] it's so yeah it's hot this Brian Johnson
[15:01] goes behind the shadow to avoid the skin
[15:05] two minutes ago was trying to look for
[15:06] ice cream shop and now he's like oh no
[15:08] the Sun is going to destroy my screen I
[15:09] have to be
[15:11] careful ah so you changed the travel PL
[15:15] just to Mark drove 2 and 1 half hours
[15:19] from Mountain cook back here to meet you
[15:23] yes oh yeah oh yes you did and NBA in oh
[15:30] also you leave you settle down here now
[15:32] um not quite not
[15:34] [Music]
[15:38] quite it's I think it's the biggest ice
[15:40] cream I've ever had
[15:43] crazy freaking mess I really I've never
[15:45] seen this before
[15:48] [Music]
[15:54] ever okay it's uh 6 p.m. and this little
[15:58] person here
[15:59] made us do a hike one of the craziest
[16:01] hike you can do in onea it normally
[16:03] takes 6 hours it's 6:20 p.m. it's going
[16:06] to be dark in 3 hours and a half we're
[16:08] going to make 6 hour in 4 hours we're
[16:11] going to do the most insane thing
[16:16] ever yeah right go you're
[16:21] [Music]
[16:24] good and another one here
[16:28] [Music]
[16:31] we made it for 1 hour 40 minutes wow and
[16:36] we are completely did we we de I know
[16:39] was worth it it's so
[16:40] beautiful yes I can see why they having
[16:43] fun training feels like adenines and
[16:46] good stuff I learned something dur we
[16:48] were doing 16 kilm trkking like it's
[16:52] impossible to do it but we made it so I
[16:55] thought no matter hard work it looks
[16:58] like
[16:59] you just keep going like a focus on your
[17:03] one step two steps and then go straight
[17:05] to the top that's hardest way will
[17:08] definitely bring you
[17:10] the that is one you Robin care
[17:19] [Music]
[17:30] morning breakfast a few supplements and
[17:32] a morning tea and best of all a book oh
[17:35] talking of which I just finished this
[17:37] book by Kevin KY he's the author of
[17:40] wired one of the big Us magazine and he
[17:42] also wrote one of my top three favorite
[17:44] book ever called excellent advice of
[17:46] wisdom I wish I knew earlier and I was
[17:48] so interested about the author that I
[17:50] read this one it's about 12 forces like
[17:53] where the technology where new
[17:54] technology like AI Etc internet is going
[17:57] to go which direction is is going to go
[17:59] over the next 50 to 100 years it was
[18:01] written 10 years ago and it's crazy how
[18:04] fast things went and how right he was
[18:07] writing this book a lot of things that
[18:08] he mentioned uh is what's happening now
[18:10] with AI chpt Etc it's an excellent read
[18:13] it's super positive like it's just feel
[18:15] pleasurable and look forward to the
[18:16] future and most importantly it's
[18:18] answering one of the question I get
[18:19] asked most often which is about like all
[18:22] ideas are taken it's too late if you
[18:23] read the book you will realize that
[18:25] actually we are at the very beginning of
[18:27] something much bigger than us and it is
[18:30] the perfect time to start building any
[18:33] business like a tiny little thing on the
[18:34] internet because there are much more
[18:36] things to come in the future things are
[18:38] going to accelerate even faster read the
[18:40] book build something breakfast coding
[18:42] let's
[18:44] [Music]
[18:51] go out of mind you like a kiss and have
[18:55] a good time come here rock and roll
[18:58] everything
