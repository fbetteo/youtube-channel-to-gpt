[00:01] I'm renting this car for 4 weeks and it
[00:04] cost about $ 1.5 th000 and if I leave
[00:07] the car in the garage for one month
[00:08] without touching it it's pretty much the
[00:10] same amount of money I lost because of
[00:12] one line of code
[00:18] [Music]
[00:29] [Music]
[00:39] all right so I use a stripe for payment
[00:41] for all of my seven tiny internet
[00:44] businesses they take around 5% cut in
[00:47] all the payments and for me that's
[00:49] around $3 to $7,000 per month which is a
[00:52] lot it's actually more expensive than
[00:54] every other business is expensive I have
[00:56] and it's even more than what I spent in
[00:57] marketing
[01:02] and the fees I pay are always different
[01:04] it depends on the credit card I charge
[01:06] it depends on the currency of the payout
[01:09] it's always so different that I usually
[01:10] close my
[01:13] [Music]
[01:16] eyes but sometimes for boring accounting
[01:19] stuff I have to export all the strip
[01:22] transactions and that's when I
[01:23] discovered something all right so these
[01:26] are some of the transactions on my
[01:28] account and there is the the fee the
[01:30] strip fee right here and then sometime
[01:33] there is a this line right here that
[01:35] says post payment invoices and usually
[01:39] it's about5 to $15 per day
[01:46] [Music]
[02:02] every year there are around 30 million
[02:04] French people go on a holiday during
[02:06] summertime and today I'm one of
[02:08] [Music]
[02:22] them now I understand why everybody
[02:25] wants to come here it's so
[02:28] beautiful I don't mind paying a little
[02:31] premium but I kind of want to know where
[02:32] my money goes so I did a little bit of
[02:34] research about those Tri post payment
[02:36] invoices and I realize that stripe
[02:39] charges 4% to generate invoices 1.6
[02:45] th000 Us doll for a
[02:47] PDF ouch so I went to my strap account
[02:51] to deactivate this option and on the
[02:53] payment link option there's this create
[02:56] an invoice PDF for 4% but it's already
[02:59] already turned off it took me a while to
[03:02] find the culprit but the reason was
[03:04] hidden in my code so since I'm lazy I'm
[03:08] I'm a programmer after all I use GitHub
[03:10] copilot to generate most of my code and
[03:13] so it generated this function here to
[03:15] create a stripe checkout session so that
[03:18] clients can pay but it turned out that
[03:20] this line of code is the reason stripe
[03:23] creates invoices for every customers and
[03:25] the reason I paid 4% for every
[03:28] transactions after I realized it was
[03:30] just money down the drain I was still a
[03:32] little bit curious and I went through
[03:33] the stripe API documentation so I
[03:36] checked for the invoice creation option
[03:38] and it does not say anything about
[03:41] charging 4% for those invoices seriously
[03:44] stripe but in the end I ended up
[03:46] creating a tool for myself to generate
[03:48] those PDF invoices and I turned it into
[03:51] a startup which I called Zenvo and it
[03:53] made way more money than I lost on those
[03:55] PDF invoices so I really believe that
[03:59] profitable cups are born out of
[04:02] frustration enough
[04:04] Fe we love
[04:05] [Music]
[04:09] you hey come here you look like a
