[00:02] bro stop coding what AI is getting so
[00:04] good they they they say it's going to
[00:05] replace us replace us we've built an
[00:09] entire company just using AI customer
[00:11] support for startup 13 how can I help
[00:13] you today why does everything has to be
[00:15] blue and someone clicked the fishing
[00:17] email we are so screwed we we don't
[00:19] offer refunds I'm sorry we need to
[00:21] change the Border radius here we we we
[00:22] should have used typescript hello boom
[00:26] no
[00:27] no guys we need a meeting right now did
[00:31] AI just turn me into a
[00:34] manager AI is not going to replace us AI
[00:37] is going to make it easier for us to
[00:38] replace everyone else so I'm going to
[00:40] show you in this video how I use AI to
[00:42] code 10x faster first I'm going to show
[00:44] you how I set up my code editor then I
[00:46] am going to show you how I use AI
[00:48] because uh I have built 30 startups
[00:50] using AI 80% of my code is returned by
[00:52] an AI and I also use it for advanced
[00:54] stuff like high level thinking and
[00:56] design and finally I'm going to give you
[00:57] a few tips on how to get the most out of
[00:59] a okay so I use cursor AI as my code
[01:02] editor and that's the only place I do AI
[01:05] stuff I don't use lovable I don't use V
[01:07] I only use cursor I am using the llm clo
[01:10] 3.5 Sunnet at the moment it's really
[01:13] good for every task it's pretty fast I
[01:14] love it and I also have Specific
[01:16] Instructions that I give cursor so in
[01:18] cursor settings cursor settings there is
[01:21] a part that's called rules for AI this
[01:23] is where I instruct the AI exactly how I
[01:26] want it to behave and if for some reason
[01:28] the AI results are not really good then
[01:30] I keep refining the rules for the AI
[01:32] until it trained perfectly on my
[01:35] preferences it is specific for my text
[01:36] tag but if it helps I'm going to copy
[01:38] past this into the description of this
[01:40] video okay now as I said I use AI for
[01:42] absolutely everything from just writing
[01:44] one line of code to having an entire
[01:46] brainstorm about the project
[01:47] architecture and so I've divided this in
[01:49] a few uh categories the first one inline
[01:52] and this is where you press comment K
[01:54] and you can uh write any instruction
[01:56] here I use that usually when I want to
[01:58] do a little fix in C CS so I'm using
[02:00] Tailwind CSS and it's really good at
[02:02] making Tailwind CSS classes from scratch
[02:04] like specific classes another uh feature
[02:07] I really love is when I copy an SVG from
[02:09] an HTML page and I want to turn it into
[02:11] a valid jsx for react uh this is
[02:13] actually just the perfect way to do it I
[02:15] find these uh inline instructions to be
[02:17] faster than the chat so uh whatever it
[02:20] does not need any specific context uh
[02:22] then I will just use this in line
[02:24] instructions all right one of the core
[02:25] feature is the chat so this little thing
[02:27] here that pops up on the right side when
[02:29] you press Comm L I barely use it for
[02:32] coding because I find it kind of boring
[02:34] to always have to all the time uh scroll
[02:36] through the entire stuff apply to uh the
[02:39] code and then check that it was actually
[02:41] added to the code I feel like it's
[02:42] taking time sometimes you make mistakes
[02:44] when it applies the changes so I used
[02:45] the chat mostly for high level thinking
[02:48] um for instance this is one of my uh
[02:50] project where I collect feedback from
[02:52] customers and um the more up votes it
[02:54] gets the higher the post is supposed to
[02:56] go now based on who created the post is
[02:59] it a regular user is it something that
[03:00] was created a long time ago or is it
[03:02] created recently uh there are a bunch of
[03:04] ways to sort those posts not just by uh
[03:07] the actual number of votes but by many
[03:09] other criterias and this is just like a
[03:10] little side project of one of my
[03:12] projects it would take me so much time
[03:13] to come up with a great algorithm so I
[03:15] would use the chat in order to give a
[03:17] few information like hey I want to
[03:18] change how those post are sorted like a
[03:21] don't code but just suggest like the
[03:23] architecture or how we can Implement
[03:24] that I give some of the instructions I
[03:26] want and usually it come up with um
[03:28] sometimes it's not the final results
[03:29] come up with really good ideas and then
[03:32] I mix match this and what I want to
[03:34] apply and then eventually I come up with
[03:36] proper instructions so I can code it
[03:37] later another excellent way to use the
[03:40] chat is to chat with the entire code
[03:42] base we're going to talk about context
[03:44] later uh but things like is there any
[03:46] way to make my API endpoint more secure
[03:48] is there any flaw inside of my API
[03:50] endpoint some sometimes there are days
[03:51] where I create like five or 10 API
[03:53] endpoints and uh it's it could be kind
[03:55] of easy to m one line to check if the
[03:57] user has a proper session or something
[03:59] uh thei is just so good at code
[04:01] reviewing to make sure that I ship my
[04:03] apps with less bugs okay whenever I need
[04:05] the AI to write code for me which is 90%
[04:08] of the case I use the composer uh the
[04:10] composer you can pop it up using command
[04:12] I and then it looks like the chat but
[04:14] it's actually a composer and normally if
[04:15] you see it's a composer there will be
[04:16] written agent here so it's an actual
[04:18] agent uh you can do stuff like uh go on
[04:21] the web and search for documentation but
[04:23] the reason I like it the most is because
[04:24] you don't have to apply the results it's
[04:26] basically like a smart AI that is going
[04:28] to try to apply what you said see if it
[04:30] works and then come back and keep
[04:31] changing until it works as expected so
[04:33] if it needs to create a new file if it
[04:35] needs to install a library you can run
[04:37] your terminal is going to update the
[04:38] files Etc and I just wait do nothing for
[04:41] a few seconds and then he came up with
[04:43] normally something that is pretty good
[04:44] usually the better the instructions I
[04:45] give which I usually get from the chat
[04:48] the better the results I'll get with the
[04:49] composer um I'm shooting this on
[04:51] February 21st 2025 I don't know when
[04:54] this video goes out I don't know what's
[04:55] going to happen with AI but one of my
[04:57] guess is that this will get un better
[04:59] and better it will get so good at some
[05:01] point that it will test itself it will
[05:03] have like a place where you can check if
[05:05] the changes were updated correctly like
[05:07] a sendbox an environment and update the
[05:09] results automatically until it's exactly
[05:11] what the instructions said it should be
[05:13] doing and finally my favorite feature by
[05:16] far is design uh I know there are a
[05:18] bunch of tools out there like versal
[05:20] vzer lovable bolt Etc I don't use any of
[05:23] this because I want my code Editor to
[05:26] design for me because it knows my code
[05:28] base it knows how I name my files it
[05:30] knows my color palette I want cursor to
[05:32] design for me and guess what this is
[05:35] actually possible so what I do when I
[05:37] want a new design um I would go to a
[05:39] popular website and I will pick the
[05:41] components I'm searching so in this case
[05:42] I'm looking for a search bar um I like
[05:44] this little search bar here so I'm just
[05:46] going to take a screenshot of it and
[05:48] then inside of cursor you can just drag
[05:50] and drop the image and you can just ask
[05:52] cursor to recreate this component and
[05:54] make it work with your API endpoint and
[05:56] so this is a very dirty prompt I I
[05:59] really didn't didn't spend time working
[06:00] on this one it was just about this video
[06:02] uh but I actually check it out and it is
[06:04] working if I search for sales so of
[06:06] course the design here is not very
[06:07] beautiful because well I didn't give any
[06:09] instructions but I would normally put it
[06:11] I don't know where somewhere on the top
[06:12] left but it's actually working this is
[06:14] crazy it even have a little effect of
[06:16] like this is just crazy it adapted these
[06:18] components that I found from Material UI
[06:21] to my website so those are my colors
[06:23] those are my borders those are the the
[06:25] the constraint the designs constraint I
[06:26] use for all of my other uh components
[06:28] and so crazy because the agent actually
[06:30] couldn't find everything like it
[06:32] struggled with something and then it
[06:34] fixed itself for some reason and then it
[06:36] created the actual components the API
[06:38] endpoint the CSS animations effect like
[06:41] this is honestly it feels like cheating
[06:43] it's crazy garbage in garbage out as the
[06:46] same goes in AI so here are some tips I
[06:49] use to get the best results with AI
[06:52] first is about naming everything uh
[06:55] actually in programming naming is the
[06:56] hardest thing to do you want your files
[06:58] you want your API input point you want
[07:00] your components to be named in a way
[07:01] that is easy for you and an AI to
[07:03] understand for instance for all of my
[07:05] projects every time I have a react
[07:07] component that is a button that's a
[07:09] physical button then I will name it
[07:11] first button and then the second part
[07:13] will be like for instance if this is
[07:14] button to delete a post is going to be
[07:16] called button delete post then the
[07:18] variables I create inside of the button
[07:21] are also uh very explicit so it's easy
[07:23] to understand that this is a Boolean
[07:25] because it's has is and loading because
[07:28] likely it's going to call an API end
[07:29] points is going to be loading all of my
[07:31] API end points are also explicit so for
[07:33] instance for/ API bu/ search I know that
[07:36] I am going to be searching for p this is
[07:38] really good because it helps the AI come
[07:40] up with better results because it
[07:42] understand your code base more easily
[07:44] tips number two is about the context
[07:46] what information do you give to the AI
[07:48] this is probably the actually the most
[07:49] important because the more context you
[07:51] give the better the results you'll get
[07:53] in my case it's kind of easy because I
[07:56] have built over 30 websites and I always
[07:58] always reuse the exact same code base so
[08:01] my tailin CSS classes are the same my
[08:03] components are all the same my text Act
[08:05] is exactly all the same and I just clone
[08:07] my codebase and then the AI already has
[08:10] foundation so it can easily uh build
[08:12] stuff on top of it and whatever it's
[08:14] going to come up with will be likely a
[08:16] good fit for the actual project if you
[08:18] don't have a code base if you don't have
[08:20] context what I recommend is you is use
[08:22] one of those like a lovable VZ bolt
[08:25] Tools in order to come up with your
[08:27] first initial code base build a project
[08:29] with it and then reuse that every single
[08:31] time for all of your ongoing projects
[08:33] and finally uh the rule of 820 it's
[08:37] again uh February 2025 right now ai is
[08:40] generating about 80% of my coding
[08:42] outputs but I still spend around 20% of
[08:44] my time uh reviewing the code that has
[08:47] been made by the AI and tweaking uh the
[08:49] little details until it gets better
[08:51] there has never been a better time in
[08:53] history to build a sci project now you
[08:55] see you have an AI that can code for you
[08:57] super fast that can help you with like
[08:58] high level architecture design Etc but
[09:01] now ai can also help you with like legal
[09:03] stuff if you need to open a company it
[09:04] can help you with uh gener smart
[09:06] marketing ideas it can help you uh right
[09:08] content for internet it can also help
[09:10] you come up with creative thumbnail like
[09:12] the one you saw and clicked so use AI
[09:14] all the time now you can build a
[09:16] oneperson company with hundreds of AI
[09:18] agents to help you with absolutely
[09:20] everything until the next video I hope
[09:22] you keep
[09:23] shipping this is the thumbnail I was
[09:26] working on
[09:28] yesterday I hope you was worth it
