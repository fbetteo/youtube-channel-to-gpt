[00:02] and boom we are live welcome back
[00:05] everyone this is the final day of the
[00:08] stream um today we are not going to code
[00:11] we are going to launch because we
[00:13] finished coding and the product is ready
[00:16] in fact over the weekend um the product
[00:19] got the first customer as you can see
[00:20] here
[00:21] $69 uh someone paid for the product so
[00:24] we have some kind of validation um um
[00:28] thanks to yeah I guess it's coming from
[00:29] my Twitter I have a little link here in
[00:31] my profile and that uh brought a couple
[00:33] hundred visitors and one of them paid so
[00:36] uh this is good I wish this would have
[00:38] happen live uh it didn't but it's still
[00:41] super cool um let me know if you are
[00:44] joining if you're in the chat if the
[00:45] quality of the audio is nice the quality
[00:47] of the video is okay I will add a link
[00:50] on Twitter for the YouTube broadcast
[00:52] where the quality is much better and if
[00:54] you have no clue who I am and what
[00:55] you're watching my name is Mark Lou I
[00:58] live in Bal Indonesia
[01:00] and I was fired 2.5 years ago something
[01:04] and I uh started to build and code
[01:06] little side projects um fast forward to
[01:09] today I have 21 side projects running up
[01:12] um and I'm earning about $50,000 per
[01:14] month um and this is what Zenvo my new
[01:17] startup that I've been building live is
[01:19] coming from uh it is a tool for uh
[01:22] people who use a stripe and don't want
[01:24] to pay the stripe invoicing fee which is
[01:27] 0.4% of um any uh
[01:30] invoice up to $2 I actually realized a
[01:34] couple weeks ago that I spent
[01:38] $16,000 on stripe invoicing for the last
[01:41] six month uh which mean I gave stripe
[01:44] $1.6 th000 to generate a PDF uh that
[01:49] that sounds like I'm very stupid I
[01:51] probably am and I built Zeno for that it
[01:54] is a alternative to that it's a onetime
[01:56] payment for a tool that can provide
[01:58] invoices for any payments on stripe um
[02:02] so we've been building the website and
[02:04] the product live uh in the last 8 days
[02:07] you can see a recap in the YouTube
[02:09] videos um we left on Friday where so the
[02:13] product was done the landing page was
[02:15] done I just spent a few hours uh testing
[02:18] things making sure that the code was
[02:20] nice there was no uh leaking or whatever
[02:22] and I also ask a few uh people that I
[02:25] know on Twitter who are using stripe if
[02:27] they would like to try the product and
[02:29] some of them say yes um and I got some
[02:32] testimonials so I added a few
[02:33] testimonials to the site as you can see
[02:35] this one from Dan this one from Phillip
[02:38] and another one from
[02:39] Nico uh that's pretty much all I've done
[02:42] and I am streaming today the launch so
[02:44] we are going to spend next two hours
[02:46] together I'm going to launch on product
[02:47] tun and I am God damn late because I
[02:50] think it started 25 minutes ago so I'm
[02:52] going to have to rush on that real quick
[02:54] um we are going to launch on reddits
[02:56] Hacker News uh whever I have a little
[02:59] leak that I'm going to share later all
[03:01] the places when I need to launch and I'm
[03:03] going to be doing this live right here
[03:06] um also um it's a minor thing but uh my
[03:10] channel got um see how was the name of
[03:14] it um monetized my channel got monetized
[03:17] so uh it it seems like crazy and um I
[03:20] would never expect to have a YouTube
[03:21] channel I would also never expect to
[03:22] make money from YouTube so this is a fun
[03:26] news and uh this is might be a little
[03:29] ridiculous amount of money but um it's
[03:31] fun it's my 10th stream of income and so
[03:35] I will take it and that feels um you
[03:37] know very precious to me uh let me go
[03:41] back on Twitter and just share the link
[03:43] with you guys if you're on Twitter I
[03:45] think you will enjoy the quality of
[03:47] YouTube better um I just need to get the
[03:50] link and uh we should be up and
[03:53] running uh um yeah we go to live
[03:58] videos this is what we are
[04:01] doing copy that I'll also probably add
[04:04] the little thumbnail once we're
[04:07] here where is
[04:12] that
[04:16] and Twitter Twitter the post is
[04:19] somewhere somewhere
[04:23] somewhere okay Bingo better
[04:27] quality on you
[04:34] YouTube okay um recommend you to check
[04:37] the YouTube link the quality is really
[04:38] much better there so we can close that
[04:41] we can close that we can close that uh
[04:43] we're going to keep the stripe dashboard
[04:44] open um you're joining
[04:47] now uh we made the first sale for the
[04:50] product that was built entirely live on
[04:53] this uh YouTube so uh this is quite
[04:56] fun um let's see what else we have so
[05:00] that video we can close Okay uh there is
[05:02] one thing that I couldn't make live
[05:05] stream is the demo video uh if you have
[05:09] been following me for a few months you
[05:13] can see that I every time I launch a new
[05:15] product I make a demo video um either I
[05:18] would wear big scissors like this and be
[05:20] on a call with the rock or I would go um
[05:24] with Leonardo DiCaprio and we will talk
[05:26] about stray disput um those are pretty
[05:29] efficient marketing technique that has
[05:31] been growing my YouTube channel and
[05:33] helped me get the word out and I did the
[05:35] exact same thing for Zen voice the video
[05:38] is right here I cannot reveal the video
[05:40] right now uh this is you know I get to
[05:43] to keep this the stream a little bit uh
[05:45] fun and entertaining um I will be
[05:47] revealing the video right after the
[05:48] product hunt launch um so you can see
[05:51] that now we are going to launch on
[05:54] prodct t uh let me know yeah quality
[05:56] just checking uh have can see your
[05:59] messages here so if you want to send
[06:01] anything I'll have a a look at it and
[06:04] we'll be moving forward with the
[06:06] launch and three what are the other nine
[06:09] uh
[06:11] man most of them are coming from uh my
[06:14] little site projects here that you can
[06:15] see on my personal website I also uh get
[06:19] probably $300 a month from Twitter I
[06:22] also have um a little very tiny um
[06:26] affiliate program that I run for a uh
[06:30] software editing whatever and I forget
[06:33] the other
[06:38] one I saw your alarm tweet I got zero
[06:40] alarms but my wife keeps waking me up
[06:43] damn you got
[06:44] a it's fun is kind of the opposite at
[06:47] home so yeah I feel you qu Twitter on
[06:51] mobile is not bad okay all right we are
[06:54] good so uh I'm launching from scratch
[06:57] literally I got nothing ready I just
[06:59] claimed the product on page uh by
[07:00] putting on my info so we have the name
[07:03] and we are going to write everything
[07:05] from
[07:06] scratch so I think we're going to say oh
[07:09] also for
[07:10] this for this launch I'm going to try
[07:12] something different um I usually
[07:14] normally tweet about the product hun
[07:17] launch and send uh you know whoever
[07:20] wants to follow my journey on Twitter to
[07:21] product hunt this time I think I will
[07:24] directly put a link to my product and
[07:26] make a separate product tant launch I
[07:28] have no idea why but my intention my
[07:30] intuition tells me to try this way so we
[07:33] can say stripe invoices maybe without
[07:36] the
[07:44] fee does that
[07:46] sound for the
[07:58] tagline
[08:00] it is a tricky product because there are
[08:03] two types of customers there are people
[08:04] who pay stripe invoices and they don't
[08:07] know they pay 0.4% like me a few weeks
[08:10] ago and there are people who make an
[08:12] invo they know that and so they do
[08:14] invoices themselves so for some people
[08:18] we need to make them aware that they pay
[08:20] the invoicing fee or just tell them that
[08:23] you know they can save the fee and for
[08:25] other customers we can tell them oh you
[08:28] can save time they're already making the
[08:30] invoices themselves and so this is kind
[08:32] of where uh It's tricky to know which
[08:34] wording I should be using I think for
[08:37] stripe I'll probably go for the for
[08:39] product T I'll probably go with the
[08:41] invoices without the
[08:46] fee when are you bu buying a
[08:50] rollsroyce okay and I think probably
[08:54] never I don't really like cars I think
[08:57] probably I'll just buy a few surfboards
[08:58] that I can bring break that's probably
[09:00] the only thing I'll be
[09:02] buying so
[09:06] or Self Serve
[09:12] invoices for your strip
[09:19] customers
[09:22] oops which one are we going to be using
[09:25] oops we have
[09:28] two
[09:33] first sh
[09:35] customers I think this one I'm going to
[09:37] go with this one okay
[09:39] um is this an open source project no I
[09:42] think here we're going to copy uh Focus
[09:45] we're going to copy
[09:48] that let your customer generate edit and
[09:50] download so you don't have
[09:58] to
[10:01] this I think will not display really
[10:03] good on product hunt but I think it
[10:04] doesn't really matter because we have
[10:06] less than two hours to launch that
[10:13] thing so you don't have to no stripe
[10:15] invoicing fee maybe I'm going to put
[10:17] this no stripe invoicing
[10:23] fee one minute no Cod
[10:28] setup
[10:39] we can leave this this
[10:41] way what time is it in Bali uh it is
[10:44] 4:30
[10:46] p.m. so product hun launch really
[10:51] late um in payment yeah there we
[10:58] go
[11:09] this is wild categories up to
[11:21] three Finance maybe I don't know ionic
[11:25] software investing invoicing tools
[11:27] perfect
[11:30] work and productivity we can try
[11:34] that e
[11:36] signature customer support
[11:42] somehow oh well that makes me think I
[11:44] need to change that no stripe invoicing
[11:46] fee here on the
[11:48] website um I said no coding for today I
[11:53] kind of messed up I'm feeling I need to
[11:56] add something
[11:57] here
[12:15] 4% reduce customer support one minute no
[12:19] good setup reduce customer support no
[12:24] 0.4 no 0.4 stripe invoice Fe think I'm
[12:28] going to push that live I just want to
[12:29] highlight the
[12:34] 0.4% is now that doesn't make a really
[12:37] big difference but we
[12:40] have is not good
[12:57] set
[13:01] like that let's
[13:02] go go or just go let's
[13:07] go let's push it we have
[13:12] um nope this is not what we want to
[13:15] do we have this uh we
[13:18] [Music]
[13:19] try PDF editor
[13:22] no resume tool scheding software
[13:25] software
[13:27] spreadsheet assistance damn there has a
[13:30] bunch of categories I didn't remember
[13:35] that all right let's move
[13:40] on um oh yes we are going to do a little
[13:43] uh so little trick if you're launching
[13:45] on product TS it
[13:47] is good um oops it give you a little
[13:52] glimpse of what is the the next product
[13:55] video going to be
[13:57] like uh we are going to to create a new
[14:00] project today we are cutting uh we're
[14:02] going to C it logo and we're going to
[14:03] say this is a square pro
[14:07] project where go all right and here we
[14:10] are going to import the logo and add a
[14:12] little fun or whatever effect on it so
[14:16] it catches attention in the news feed um
[14:20] dead
[14:23] voice IC on
[14:27] here so here
[14:28] [Music]
[14:30] um what effects do we
[14:36] have then we need to add a transition
[14:38] and for that transition let's find a
[14:41] weird
[14:49] transition think that doesn't look
[14:57] terrible
[15:01] this is not the most
[15:02] [Music]
[15:11] beautiful leavea lens flare maybe
[15:18] this okay we have it
[15:23] um yeah we want to leave a few seconds
[15:25] before and a few seconds after and this
[15:28] is 4 seconds so it's going to
[15:33] appear yeah okay we need to
[15:36] cut that and make this a little bit
[15:42] longer all right there we go going to
[15:46] extract that little thing and I have
[15:48] made a preset in F Cut Pro that lets me
[15:51] normally export these as a
[15:54] gif let's see how that
[15:57] works and normally when we come back
[15:59] here we have a
[16:02] logo okay that is working select an
[16:08] image normally this gef will play on
[16:13] Hover yes so it catches a little bit of
[16:15] attention um here we need to pass some
[16:19] images um I have a YouTube video so that
[16:23] will do a little bit of a that will be
[16:25] the first frame I guess I'll need to
[16:29] make
[16:31] um let's see figma what we have
[16:38] here think I'm not going to bother too
[16:51] much is there's anything we have we can
[16:54] close
[16:55] that is there anything we have that's
[16:57] worth sh showing
[17:07] uh maybe I'll maybe I'll put this
[17:12] one just to show whatever an invoice or
[17:16] a picture
[17:19] whatever we
[17:23] go here for the launch day salutes here
[17:26] we
[17:27] go
[17:31] [Music]
[17:33] um okay we have photos we have logo
[17:36] think we can move on to the makers I
[17:38] worked on these
[17:39] products and I am a solo maker even
[17:43] though you guys helped a lot on
[17:46] YouTube
[17:49] um bootstrap I plan to see VC nope uh
[17:53] can we share the prodct yes

[18:01] product hunt damn I should be here on
[18:04] this page hurry up Mark you can add
[18:05] markdowns on product
[18:07] hunt I recommend you to do that because
[18:10] because because you can add links for
[18:13] instance to your
[18:14] product and for that I usually check if
[18:18] I can edit my previous post yep and I
[18:22] can just Cy past all that and here I'm
[18:27] going to say hey

[28:01] [Music]
[28:02] three 9 hours after could be good okay
[28:05] I'm going to leave the defaults as it
[28:08] is okay um let's think what else do we
[28:18] have yo
[28:20] Jack love the Gmail animation on the
[28:22] landing page yeah man I got this from
[28:26] mosle mozo app this is actually Nico my
[28:31] friend who recommended me to check this
[28:32] app and uh they are like 10x
[28:36] smarter that what I
[28:38] did but that gave me a lot of
[28:40] inspiration for
[28:41] it plastic oh
[28:45] man wait is it
[28:50] a that's yeah that's exactly what yes
[28:56] boy
[28:58] let's listen to some music I think that
[28:59] will pump up that'll make me pumped up
[29:01] for the
[29:06] launch right
[29:09] um try
[29:12] up uh we have this we need I have a
[29:16] little launch by the way
[29:18] of
[29:21] things that I platforms that I use for
[29:24] launching uh we don't need this one
[29:28] should we launch on
[29:34] ball yes of course because beta list is
[29:38] not yours
[29:39] man I don't even know should I launch
[29:42] there is it boring I think it's a boring
[29:45] it's a bit boring platform you used to
[29:46] bring some traffic to my products but I
[29:48] don't think it does nowadays let's see
[29:51] if one of my let's see the traffic we
[29:54] get for instance for by dispute from
[29:56] that
[30:05] peit wall okay Peach wall brought seven
[30:09] visitors for this so we're going to
[30:12] ditch pit all for
[30:14] good and I think the the link is
[30:17] actually not
[30:18] even let's
[30:22] see I think it's not even a follow link
[30:25] so we probably don't care
[30:28] no follow okay right
[30:31] F let's move on P we don't care um yeah
[30:36] my Indie page as well I think I have it
[30:41] there yes
[30:43] okay
[30:45] good fast I think I plugged
[30:49] already this under all of my startups it
[30:53] is yes invoice here
[30:56] okay what else maybe bu dispute we can
[30:59] check and we can maybe check Lo
[31:02] Barrel I plug I cross promote I mean
[31:04] it's not promotion but I add links to
[31:06] all my
[31:07] startups in the footer you can see
[31:10] invoice here and here we have eno as
[31:13] well okay we're good with
[31:16] that oh yeah also that's a
[31:21] little uh perk so for ship fast uh which
[31:25] is another product that I run uh say B
[31:27] plate for
[31:28] developers there is a section called
[31:30] payments where I explain how to use the
[31:34] B plate to process payment with stripe I
[31:36] also have a little bit of educational
[31:38] things like how to hand it's already
[31:40] done for you but like you know explainer
[31:42] of how stripe subscription life cycles
[31:44] work I usually plug related prom
[31:47] products to that so here I added tired
[31:49] of managing stripe invoices let your
[31:51] customer edit blah blah blah blah and I
[31:53] added that thing here so I think we're
[31:55] good with that
[31:58] future pedia no it's not ai2 index5
[32:01] either there's nope okay we have maybe
[32:04] let's go for
[32:05] Reddit let's do Reddit
[32:10] um maybe there is a
[32:13] stripe what what happened to the rui I'm
[32:16] lost here and what is that thing here oh
[32:19] okay because I clicked there
[32:21] okay uh what is the name of it maybe
[32:24] it's tribe Community can I plug
[32:26] something there
[32:27] think if I try to plug something I might
[32:29] get
[32:31] banned let's
[32:37] see who is actually
[32:40] using looking for help reach out to
[32:46] okay social
[32:48] media oh [ __ ]
[32:51] sorry e stripe support okay harassement
[32:54] no spam it includes self promotion for
[32:57] paid services or good R guideline
[32:59] applying here which guideline is
[33:14] it yeah that might not be the right
[33:16] place to promote let's see if some
[33:18] people are actually promoting products a
[33:20] to my STP account without getting back
[33:22] that is a really good
[33:25] question artificially lower chargeback
[33:28] rates to balance the stupidity of
[33:30] humoron broke
[33:32] customers I have to be so inting but
[33:34] here's the effect my charge back rate is
[33:36] inre Sal Force epics
[33:41] rers I think it's more of a support
[33:43] Community if I plug my product I'll
[33:45] get banned I
[33:49] think Tri was
[33:52] my the worst experience
[33:55] everes with stri a good question
[33:58] P I know I think this is not a really
[34:00] good idea
[34:02] um where else can we promote I for sure
[34:05] site project I'm going to be promoting
[34:06] there because this is what it's made
[34:09] for
[34:13] um
[34:15] maybe let's see I've always fed with the
[34:18] idea of launching stuff I am the in the
[34:20] U and I'm worry of mine regarding GPR
[34:22] stuff I don't have a business entity yet
[34:24] if I launch an app where users sign up
[34:27] for example not charging them or
[34:28] something in the beginning until
[34:29] building a user base let's say is it
[34:32] worth worry about the gdpr terms of
[34:35] Condition what Kind of surface could be
[34:36] delayed man I don't know I wouldn't
[34:39] worry too much I think unless you start
[34:40] to be a big company or you eventually
[34:42] have a registered company in a You
[34:44] country I wouldn't care too
[34:47] much I got probably a million visitors
[34:49] on my site last year and I never had any
[34:53] cookie gdpr whatever
[34:55] policy
[35:02] programming I know I'm going to take it
[35:04] easy otherwise this stream is going to
[35:06] last forever I am just going to launch
[35:08] inside project so for
[35:12] that
[35:14] um yeah I've been posting a few actually
[35:17] I can show you I've been posting a few
[35:20] projects on this this
[35:22] subreddit uh damn the r new Reddit UI is
[35:26] tricky
[35:31] costs I think there used to be a way to
[35:35] see which what were my
[35:39] S yeah this
[35:42] one this
[35:45] one I sold my habit tracker uh this one
[35:49] is not a
[35:51] launch I made a code B plate yeah this
[35:53] so this is a good example I usually
[35:56] launch in this and you see posts 100 115
[36:00] 155 151 22 those
[36:04] are got to stop the music because it's
[36:06] too loud um yeah I usually make a little
[36:10] video using screen Studio which I'm
[36:11] going to be using right now that demos
[36:13] the product so I am going to be talking
[36:15] to the live stream and I think at the
[36:17] same time oh you can see my green screen
[36:19] the same time I am going to be talking
[36:20] to
[36:23] uh the like I'm try I'm going to try to
[36:25] make one of those videos so
[36:27] let's see get
[36:30] there good
[36:32] okay the road okay
[36:37] um so usually what works in this subred
[36:40] is to
[36:40] explain why you've built the product
[36:43] that you built and then qu give a quick
[36:47] demo how would I do that uh probably I'm
[36:50] going to go here going to zoom like
[36:55] crazy
[36:57] hey my name is Mark and I am a solo
[37:00] entrepreneur I build couple internet
[37:04] businesses and I spent $1.6 th000 to
[37:07] stripe last year to generate PDF for my
[37:13] invoices so I removed this option maybe
[37:18] I can show that option here that would
[37:19] be actually a good
[37:24] thing where is it
[37:30] VI the payment
[37:33] link maybe I can show that
[37:36] after all
[37:39] right that could be a good
[37:43] hook uh I
[37:46] spent so I build Zenvo in
[37:50] order
[37:53] okay please do not load
[38:07] um and then we have a link oh I think I
[38:10] will need to show a local example of
[38:13] that um I need to show the link as
[38:18] well
[38:22] and this will go here and I'm going to
[38:25] show that sorry it's uh I'm I'm
[38:28] rehearsing what I'm going to show and
[38:30] tell in that video so first page second
[38:34] page uh how it works my link and finally
[38:38] I think I'm going to show a demo of
[38:40] invoices I hope this page
[38:43] work uh can I get a local
[38:48] token this one doesn't work maybe this
[38:50] one will
[38:51] work
[38:53] [ __ ] where is the link I know I have a
[38:57] local environment working with the link
[38:59] I just don't know which one it
[39:01] is right I'm going to make this link
[39:04] available
[39:06] then
[39:08] um yeah we're going to go
[39:11] to
[39:13] [Music]
[39:14] tokens say
[39:17] token hurry up
[39:22] Mark expires in 2025 so we're good with
[39:28] that and normally I refresh and it
[39:31] should be working okay and then I can
[39:33] show those
[39:34] invoices I can zoom a little bit on
[39:38] that I need to reduce okay
[39:42] yeah I can show my invoices bam and I
[39:45] can
[39:47] see okay that is good oh I think dude I
[39:51] think the Tweet is live bingo if you

[40:22] Twitter tuning in the chat if this is
[40:25] working
[40:29] oh oh Twitter will not let me
[40:32] send links that are clickable
[40:35] interesting I can reply to those
[40:38] okay and
[40:40] probably in my
[40:42] [Music]
[40:43] channel what do we have here yeah
[40:47] Bingo all right I sent the link to the
[40:49] Tweet um if you guys have a minute I
[40:52] would love your support and you can
[40:54] watch that video
[40:57] and see
[40:58] uh what stupid idea I came up in mind
[41:02] this morning um well actually maybe I
[41:05] can give you a quick
[41:10] demo so if you're curious um those those
[41:14] are um videos that I make in general
[41:17] when I launch a new product um I
[41:19] recently made a video on my YouTube
[41:21] channel that is about um building
[41:25] startup quickly I think the link is here
[41:30] this one right
[41:31] there and for some reason I don't know I
[41:34] think I found maybe a picture online on
[41:36] internet of Jim Carry typing like crazy
[41:38] on his keyboard and I thought it would
[41:39] be a good thumbnail for a video so I
[41:42] made that stuff and that movie Bruce
[41:45] Almighty with Jim Curry kept staying in
[41:47] my mind for a while and so I had to make
[41:51] a video to launch the product and so
[41:54] what I what I I tried to come up with
[41:57] you know uh a way to plug my products in
[42:01] this video and so after spending a few
[42:04] uh um minutes thinking about how do I
[42:07] integrate myself in the movie I managed
[42:10] to come up with a basic script and a
[42:12] basic editing and in 3 hours I had this
[42:14] video up and running and usually those
[42:17] videos are doing pretty well uh they
[42:19] really help me get the word out
[42:22] there right time to site project Reddit
[42:27] um so
[42:31] Mark I am a solo entrepreneur and I
[42:34] built uh tiny internet online Internet
[42:36] businesses that are now making $50,000 a
[42:39] month in revenue and I realized I spent
[42:41] I gave stri $1.6 th000
[42:44] us just to generate inv PDF invoices in
[42:48] 2023 just to generate PDF
[42:51] invoices when I learn that I turn off
[42:54] the option I turn off the option here so
[42:57] without creating the invoice
[42:59] and my email St to be floated with
[43:02] customers asking for um
[43:05] invoices and so I built Zenvo so I built
[43:09] Zenvo a little stripe in um a no code
[43:12] tool for um no code tool for stripe it's
[43:18] no code for lets your customer generate
[43:21] uh edit and download invoices so you
[43:23] don't have to do it uh there is no
[43:25] stripe it's a
[43:27] onetime payment uh software once you pay
[43:29] you have unlimited access you don't pay
[43:32] the stripe fee anymore you don't have
[43:33] any customer support so you can send the
[43:35] link back to by email or add it to your
[43:36] customer dashboard and it is very simple
[43:39] to set up let's go going to try and make
[43:42] a one shot for this
[43:44] video let's see how that
[43:50] goes oh maybe all right maybe I can do
[43:55] that
[43:58] that's going to be tricky but let's do
[44:03] it hey my name is Mark I am a solo
[44:06] entrepreneur and I build a lot no that's
[44:08] pretty
[44:13] [ __ ] hey my name is Mark and I am a solo
[44:16] entrepreneur and I still
[44:21] [ __ ] in Revenue I recently realized that
[44:24] I gave stripe 1.6 ,000 us just to
[44:28] generate PDF
[44:30] invoices um
[44:33] and that PF
[44:40] invoices so I turned
[44:46] off so I turned off the option to
[44:49] generate invoices with stripe and my U
[44:52] emails started to be floated with
[44:54] customers asking for invoices
[44:56] so I made a tools to
[45:03] fix so I turn off the option to generate
[45:07] invoices with stripe and after that my
[45:10] email started to be flooded with
[45:11] customer asking for invoices so I made a
[45:14] little tool called Zen invoice to fix
[45:16] that it's a noal tool that plugs with
[45:18] all your strap account and let your
[45:20] customers generate edit and download
[45:22] invoices so you don't have to you don't
[45:24] have the stripe invoicing fee it's a
[45:26] onetime payment and you have unlimited
[45:27] access and it's going to reduce your
[45:29] customer support let me show you how
[45:30] that
[45:31] works once you get access to the product
[45:34] you will land on this page we use
[45:36] restricted stripe API keys to secretly
[45:39] uh connect your stripe account without
[45:41] having any um edit edit permissions to
[45:43] your account this
[45:46] [ __ ] let me show you how it works once
[45:49] you get access to the product you will
[45:50] be connecting your strap accounts using
[45:52] restricted API Keys those are secure
[45:54] keys that only have have view access to
[45:57] uh limited uh data on your strap
[45:59] accounts um you're going to have all
[46:01] your strap account being uh displayed
[46:03] here pre-populated with their logo and
[46:05] icons and everything that is being
[46:06] fetched from stripe and you will have a
[46:08] unique link that is connected to all
[46:10] your account where customers can
[46:12] retrieve any invoices they've made with
[46:14] any of um your strip accounts once they
[46:17] enter the email and if an invoice or if
[46:20] a payment is found They will receive a
[46:22] secure link where they can view all the
[46:24] invoices they made with your business
[46:26] and then they can click and edit uh some
[46:28] information there so they can add for
[46:31] instance uh their uh vat details which
[46:34] is good for customers that are in Europe
[46:35] or if they made a mistake when they um a
[46:38] typo when they start when they made a
[46:40] purchase they'll be able to fix it then
[46:42] they just click download and they will
[46:44] have a little uh invoice uh template
[46:47] that is uh
[46:51] compliant we can leave with that it's a
[46:53] bit long
[46:54] though
[46:56] I have to cut some parts of it wow this
[46:58] is tricky
[47:00] I'm okay I have to limit the
[47:15] sound okay I have to go
[47:24] here
[47:48] he's going to
[47:54] be
[48:07] it's a bit it's yeah the video is a bit
[48:11] boring but it's okay because we're doing
[48:15] this
[48:16] live kind of have limited
[48:19] resources it's also weird to make those
[48:21] videos live on Twitter when I'm doing I
[48:24] editing the videos but uh it's pretty
[48:26] fun to give it a
[48:30] try all right I'm going to generate
[48:32] those subtitles I'm talking about the
[48:38] invoice
[48:40] no or
[48:51] stripe okay we can also probably
[48:54] increase a little bit the size for
[48:57] friendliness oh I think my wife is
[49:04] [Music]
[49:07] back how does this thing knows that my
[49:11] name is written with a c and not a k
[49:14] usually in America in America in English
[49:17] my name is written with a
[49:19] K this is quite
[49:22] impressive come on Zoom
[49:24] okay
[49:33] increase that a
[49:49] bit oh
[49:53] wait you
[50:01] yeah we're
[50:17] back
[50:24] generate
[50:35] oh maybe I should make everything a bit
[50:39] faster yeah
[50:43] yeah I think because I'm boring uh and
[50:45] I'm speaking French I mean I'm French so
[50:48] I speak English quite
[50:49] slowly I will reduce fter to speed a
[50:54] bit
[51:02] okay uh no can zoom on that that would
[51:06] be
[51:17] cool
[51:22] he we can cut that
[51:28] you [ __ ] up
[51:29] here oh no no
[51:41] no he
[51:45] dead
[51:47] okay and zoom like crazy here as
[51:54] well
[52:24] yeah
[52:36] remove that and we can K that okay and
[52:39] we have a video we're going to export
[52:41] that and we're going to put be posting
[52:43] that on Reddit I'm a little bit quiet I
[52:46] need to focus on that
[52:48] thing W accounting small business
[52:54] s
[52:55] okay this is uh some really horny French
[52:59] thing here right we could not listen to
[53:01] the music it was playing for you only
[53:10] okay I think if I put the music live and
[53:13] you guys can hear it I might get banned
[53:15] I mean this video might get banned from
[53:17] YouTube so I'll will avoid playing any
[53:19] kind of music for now like I'm saying
[53:22] that because it actually happened to me
[53:24] once
[53:25] [Music]
[53:31] um all right I think we can copy what we
[53:34] said for product
[53:35] hunt
[53:38] and
[53:41] products where is it Z
[53:46] invoice where are we here we can
[53:53] probably we can probably copy what
[53:56] happened so simple so good that man I
[53:59] especially appreciate that you built
[54:00] with the industry leing as CH
[54:03] pass that was the K is right my purchase
[54:09] decision think
[54:15] where is the Le working and the link is
[54:17] working
[54:19] okay all right we're going to copy
[54:21] probably that and say I realize I gave
[54:25] TR invoice
[54:27] okay and going back to Reddit uh we are
[54:30] going to
[54:33] post I don't even know how create a post
[54:36] wow that that really new UI is kind of
[54:39] confusing me though all right so usually
[54:42] what I do is image and I said I made a
[54:47] no code tool doesn't matter no it
[54:49] doesn't
[54:50] matter a tool
[54:54] to
[55:08] a tool to ditch St invoicing
[55:15] Fe dit stripe if you guys have any clue
[55:18] of uh a good headline that would that
[55:20] would perform I mean not perform but
[55:22] that would sound well on reddits I might
[55:25] say something like
[55:29] that ditch the stripe invoicing
[55:33] fee let's see if we get the video now
[55:38] um video display that's probably
[55:44] this
[55:46] okay are we going to be posting
[55:49] that there it here and I'm going cling
[55:54] this
[56:01] okay um I made a tool to ditch the
[56:03] stripe to ditch the stripe invoicing
[56:09] fee this is not the most uh killer
[56:12] headline but not bad hey Mark how are
[56:13] you how do you connect analytics already
[56:16] how many visitors to your Landing that's
[56:18] a great question we can check this out
[56:19] right now
[56:22] actually mhm
[56:26] zvo we have had oh wow we've had almost
[56:29] a thousand visitors on the page I have
[56:32] really no clue where this coming from 49
[56:35] visitors on the page
[56:38] that's a nice amount of visitors right
[56:41] now let's see what it looks like yeah it
[56:43] looks like there is a clear daily launch
[56:47] stuff oh it's because oh yeah I think
[56:48] it's because of my tweet
[56:51] probably oh yeah okay that makes sense
[56:54] yeah cu the link is right right above
[56:55] the tweet and it's being pushed right
[57:00] now okay
[57:04] um all right let's so so s I made a tool
[57:07] to dit the stripe invoicing
[57:15] uh I think that okay I think that should
[57:17] be nice I am
[57:19] the original Community okay
[57:22] B let's do it
[57:27] the URL poster cannot be empty uh okay
[57:31] let me explain what are you talking
[57:33] about the provid token has expired okay
[57:37] thank you
[57:39] buddy if there is any other unvaluable
[57:43] information you can give me
[57:47] Reddit provided
[57:50] token they get ban or
[57:53] what
[58:00] all right let's try it
[58:04] again okay it looks like it's working
[58:06] this
[58:07] time bingo we are live on Reddit
[58:12] um hey rors hey
[58:16] hey Hustlers hey
[58:22] Hustlers creating invoice
[58:27] my work here this is quite
[58:31] nice yeah I think that will do the
[58:37] work he knows to link oh wow pretty
[58:49] cool okay we're going to keep that live
[58:52] we're going to keep the product hunt
[58:53] launch right here I think we might keep
[58:56] a twitch launch right there we can
[58:59] monitor what is going on and also
[59:02] probably add a little posible analytic
[59:05] so we can have oh maybe I can split the
[59:08] screen H that would be
[59:10] nice we have the visitors here on the
[59:15] left I'm trying something new Bingo and
[59:18] we have the page here so we can see what
[59:21] is actually going on and probably here
[59:23] we want to have the tripe dasboard see
[59:27] if we get any customers from this launch
[59:30] so far no customer I hope I don't know
[59:34] what time is it 5:30 I'm going to be
[59:36] streaming for the next 30 minutes I hope
[59:38] we get a customer live together that
[59:40] would be cool that be the Pinnacle of
[59:44] the stream that I can just close the
[59:45] computer and be good for the
[59:47] [Music]
[59:49] day right so here we have the launch the
[59:53] Reddit the Twitter
[59:56] this is from the past I'm going to do
[59:59] hiker news
[60:01] now uh for Hacker News actually if you
[60:04] are interested I try to write everything
[60:06] I learn in my newsletter marlo.
[60:23] beehive.org first post on this is crazy
[60:25] my first post on Hacker News I had no
[60:28] clue like I had no I was making zero
[60:30] dollar a month I had no audience on
[60:32] Twitter and I just made this little tool
[60:36] that was
[60:37] free called mood to
[60:40] movie show you it's an app oh [ __ ] oh
[60:44] okay it's because the link is not yeah
[60:46] okay this little tool
[60:49] here that's fetching movies based on a
[60:52] card you would tap on and this went a
[60:55] little bit viral and that's how I got my
[60:57] first Twitter followers and that's kind
[60:59] of what
[61:00] happened uh that's that's the thing that
[61:02] probably Kickstart the journey for
[61:04] me pretty cool um let's see what we how
[61:08] we can write I think haer news likes
[61:10] more like trendy like not trendy but
[61:13] like um you know challenging the status
[61:15] quo if that makes
[61:17] sense so going to do show Hacker
[61:21] News the URL will be Zenvo
[61:26] so there are a few options here we can
[61:28] say the classic one I made a
[61:30] [Music]
[61:33] tool no
[61:35] code
[61:42] ditching let's pull the notes um I made
[61:47] a NOCO tool to justy I made a tool I
[61:51] built a tool
[61:56] I made a
[61:59] tool or maybe I can just say strip
[62:03] invoice is without the
[62:06] fee this is probably a little bit too
[62:14] vague I made a NOCO tool to just I made
[62:17] a
[62:18] tool I think I'm going to go with a
[62:20] classic
[62:23] dit or maybe to cancel no it's not
[62:26] cancel to
[62:33] ditch
[62:44] sap how do you deploy your apps uh I
[62:47] push it to git and versal pull the git
[62:51] and deploy it for
[62:53] me great launch on the launch Mark yes I
[62:56] made it to the launch Day Kevin yo boy
[62:59] you did actually you I think you've been
[63:00] show showing up every day if not almost
[63:03] every day at least to dump oh to ditch
[63:06] to dump right invoicing fee that is not
[63:13] bad um I made a tool to
[63:16] dump to dump or to
[63:20] ditch maybe ditch yeah I think ditch is
[63:23] more relevant for that thing should I
[63:27] post I should post let's
[63:31] go all right I made a tool to ditch
[63:34] stripe invoicing fee
[63:37] maybe maybe

[69:19] launched product hunt launched Indie
[69:22] page launched LinkedIn oh yeah check on
[69:25] LinkedIn I think I made a post I might
[69:27] have to edit a few things
[69:32] there oh well LinkedIn is sending a lot
[69:35] of
[69:39] support all the best thank you all the
[69:43] best team this looks like AI generated
[69:48] team how that
[69:52] goes uh LinkedIn okay Twitter we'll have
[69:55] to do a few stuff oh yeah I need to do
[69:57] that this is done this is done this is
[70:02] not done Dev Hunt is cool but not for
[70:05] this tool all right we need okay I think
[70:07] a few things missing now we have to make
[70:12] a few more
[70:13] tweets about it
[70:17] and more truth about it and we have to
[70:21] oh [ __ ] that's goingon to yeah that's a
[70:24] boring part I have to do it I lost all
[70:27] my stuff okay no here yes okay so we are
[70:30] going to go to the newsletter app.
[70:34] beehive poost I
[70:36] guess
[70:40] it okay and now that is going to be the
[70:44] tricky part but I think I have to copy
[70:47] past the link to Z invoice I usually
[70:52] edit
[71:06] I need to edit all that oh
[71:09] [ __ ] so I have a
[71:12] newsletter
[71:14] and uh let's see I add links to my
[71:17] startups at the
[71:18] bottom and oh maybe I can
[71:22] just
[71:27] wait maybe I don't have okay
[71:33] maybe
[71:38] um invoice how we going to call
[71:44] that uh let your
[71:48] customers
[71:50] generate and
[71:52] download
[71:55] there maybe you just stripe invoices
[71:59] without
[72:01] defeat that's a bit
[72:03] generic and we can say
[72:08] five now does a look
[72:12] on okay links are clickable that's good
[72:16] strip invoices without the fee I think
[72:18] I'm going to run with that okay let's do
[72:21] it I'll have to edit a few of them Ah
[72:25] that's going to take a little
[72:31] while be careful not
[72:33] to H up anything
[72:47] here and boy I started this newsletter
[72:50] back in August I think or September last
[72:53] year

[73:04] newsletter posts that I've been writing
[73:07] and seems crazy to
[73:17] me that's a shitload of issues I'll
[73:21] probably have to find a way
[73:23] add some HTML that I can embed or
[73:26] something because every time I launch a
[73:28] new product I'm going to have to re read
[73:33] all those posts scroll to the bottom and
[73:36] add that oh
[73:41] no invoice stri invoices without
[73:46] the oh yes I have to copy past

[78:17] much time did you spend making this

[78:23] days exact nine days
[78:26] from ID to launch thanks thanks for
[78:35] support see there we go
[78:39] um maybe we can write a few tweets
[78:43] shouldn't
[78:45] we let's see what I get
[78:51] here
[78:59] let's see let's see let's see
[79:11] um what time we get yeah we got 15 more
[79:15] minutes I get a meeting date night with
[79:17] the wife I got to make sure I'm on
[79:20] time um oh I need to check yeah is the
[79:24] video on YouTube live that is very
[79:31] important making sure that this
[79:36] video okay the video is live this is
[79:38] good
[79:45] um okay I think we're good for today
[79:48] probably the last thing I can do
[79:51] is
[79:54] I need to make a few tweets I have
[79:56] literally
[80:01] nothing yeah I have to make a few tweet
[80:03] so I think I'm going to copy that and
[80:15] say
[80:21] literally
[80:36] I think actually I think I
[80:37] can think we are good with the stream I
[80:39] think I'll I'll stay on the stream I'll
[80:41] take a few questions if uh there's
[80:43] anything you guys want to talk about and
[80:45] I think we be good for these products
[80:47] I'll will be sharing uh data on Twitter
[80:50] of you know um traffic payments if any
[80:54] still no payments that is a bit sad uh
[80:57] well how many visitors do we have in
[80:59] total 500 visitors and zero payment
[81:03] within okay it's been 1 hour
[81:06] so we shouldn't be too greedy
[81:11] although although I see it's it's pretty
[81:14] hard to judge you know some people um
[81:16] some people can decide later not right
[81:18] away I'll see how
[81:21] much
[81:24] customers will be generated at the end
[81:26] of this launch I will give it like 48
[81:28] hours to 72 hours and see the ratio
[81:32] between traffic to customers and what
[81:36] I'm trying to do now is I have so many
[81:38] ideas and I try to put my time where um
[81:42] I get the most results so because
[81:44] usually getting the most results meaning
[81:45] it's helping the most people um I saw
[81:48] that with ship pass where I got tons of
[81:50] messages of people actually shipping the
[81:52] their startups and making money online
[81:54] and this is where I want to focus my
[81:56] attention so if the current ratio of uh
[82:01] customer traffic to customer doesn't
[82:02] change much I'll probably keep Zeno as a
[82:05] product that's here on the side I fix
[82:07] bugs if there are any bugs um and I will
[82:10] just not be adding any feature I will
[82:11] not be doing any marketing I'll not try
[82:13] to whatever do partnership or SEO I'll
[82:15] just sa the product as it is it doesn't
[82:17] require any support from me I'm using it
[82:19] for all
[82:20] my startups you can see here I have uh
[82:24] probably what was that 10 yeah I didn't
[82:27] even add all my accounts here but I have
[82:29] all my strap accounts connected right
[82:31] here and so as I going to be using it
[82:34] every day I if there's something you
[82:36] know that needs Improvement or whatever
[82:37] I'll know it but I'll probably not focus
[82:40] too much on it uh until I find this this
[82:42] is pretty much a strategy that I've been
[82:43] using last year until I find something
[82:46] where that clicks where people are
[82:48] really really um you know like that
[82:51] there there is some kind of like a a
[82:53] feat somewhere let's see why that
[83:02] goesel uh so the question is why don't
[83:05] you build more why don't you Dev focus
[83:09] on some of your SS instead of building
[83:11] new ones um everybody's different um I
[83:15] have a feeling that with a need for your
[83:18] product in the market or not and I've
[83:20] been tweaking some I've been actually
[83:23] focusing I spent one year on a product
[83:24] another year on a SAS and almost a year
[83:26] on a habit tracker trying to you know
[83:30] grow it uh twak a few stuff add new
[83:33] features change the headlines and just
[83:35] spending most of my time on one product
[83:38] and for me it never worked so what I'm
[83:40] doing now is I'm I launch product I see
[83:42] how the market reacts and if I have some
[83:44] Feit like ship fast I'll keep adding
[83:46] features um I've been adding features to
[83:48] sh fast almost every weeks or two weeks
[83:50] since the launch and I'm going to add a
[83:52] new feature tomorrow and if there is no
[83:55] fit like this I usually move on to a new
[83:59] product and I C I kept all those product
[84:01] that I have so bu dispute Indie page
[84:03] Zenvo I use them daily I update them uh
[84:06] when when it's needed I just don't focus
[84:08] on it as much as I would if there was
[84:11] like a massive Market fit anyone knows I
[84:14] mean bageri yes buddy I've been
[84:17] following some of his stream on YouTube
[84:18] and a very interesting and ambitious
[84:21] person love him
[84:22] I'm also creating my Indie page here we
[84:25] go did you design the learning page
[84:28] yourself uh yes I did I did I did uh
[84:31] this is heavily inspired by uh whatever
[84:34] I find on the internet I usually uh
[84:36] browse you know beautiful Ling Pages get
[84:39] inspired and end up making my own
[84:41] landing page
[84:43] now the text t uh the text Tech is the
[84:47] same I use for all my products I have
[84:50] mongodb as a database hosted on
[84:52] something called Atlas I think I use
[84:55] nextjs for my apps um and I host
[84:59] everything on versal and I also use
[85:01] nextjs as an API as a backend with the
[85:04] API
[85:05] folder so I don't have any other backend
[85:07] than nextjs I use Tailwind CSS and Daisy
[85:10] UI for the
[85:12] components
[85:13] um mail gun for the emails stripe as you
[85:17] guess for payment processing and I
[85:19] bundled I bundled all that in sh pass as
[85:24] you can see
[85:28] here what have you done to priv when you
[85:30] decide to build to make this product
[85:33] what have you done to prev validate the
[85:34] product literally nothing um it it's
[85:37] come from a personal frustration um I
[85:39] spent I gave stripe $1.6 th000 for
[85:44] PDFs that that's a little bit crazy to
[85:47] me so especially stri they take so they
[85:51] take 3% plus um depending on your
[85:53] country I have a currency conversion and
[85:56] I end up giving almost 6% to my income
[85:59] to stripe and the fact that you add 0.4%
[86:02] to that just to generate a PDF um that
[86:05] click something that I felt like that
[86:06] was like a little bit too crazy and so I
[86:09] also saw that people like niik
[86:12] Janet Nik without family
[86:15] name he made a invoice generator is it I
[86:19] think I've lost him probably no I think
[86:21] it's here
[86:23] uh he made a post uh because he also got
[86:27] the same problem right here and he got
[86:30] 400 likes so I I could have guessed that
[86:33] there was something going on here like
[86:35] if people like this and people in the
[86:37] comments say something like oh I have
[86:38] the same I have the same invoice
[86:41] problem um yeah I figured out that you
[86:44] know there will be some kind of
[86:45] validation but didn't spend I really
[86:47] just build and see and how is ship F
[86:50] performing in February uh um it's a bit
[86:52] slower I would say it average
[86:55] $1,000 per day so probably 30k this
[87:00] month yeah that's pretty much
[87:04] it discovered your stream
[87:07] that that's the get [ __ ] done attitude
[87:10] nice to see how much you can get done in
[87:11] 90 minutes good luck with Z voice thank
[87:14] you so much thank you so much yeah I'll
[87:16] be showing up I'll taking I'll try to
[87:18] take YouTube uh sery this year um making
[87:21] a video per week and also going live and
[87:24] make some streams um building startups
[87:26] live and so I hope we'll we'll keep in
[87:29] touch for the next um startup Building
[87:32] Product and I think we can wrap up the
[87:34] stream right now I think we're pretty
[87:36] good so we
[87:37] have we have zero payments
[87:40] made so this is uh sad this is not
[87:45] happening live I'll be reporting on
[87:46] Twitter everything within 24 hours how
[87:48] many visitors how many uh purchases if
[87:51] any and we'll see that um I can close
[87:55] that and check real quick how is product
[87:57] T
[87:59] going 42 likes that is pretty
[88:02] nice we have
[88:04] Reddit uh we have someone who disliked
[88:07] it Reddit is not this one is not likely
[88:09] to go well um yeah Twitter is going well
[88:13] this is
[88:14] good LinkedIn uh it's a tiny audience
[88:18] but it's quite
[88:20] nice and hiker news not yet anyway um
[88:26] we'll still have 40 visitors on the site
[88:29] at the current moment still quite a lot
[88:31] of people there and I think we can wrap
[88:34] up with
[88:36] that I hope I'm wrong but I think it'll
[88:38] be a tricky P to sell as you need to be
[88:39] making large dollar as invoice fee large
[88:42] enough to matter it is yeah that's a
[88:45] really good point
[88:46] um it is yeah yeah people will need to
[88:51] yeah if you you make yeah if you make
[88:53] $1,000 uh with stripe you might as well
[88:57] use their invoicing
[88:59] fee um I think I calculated I think
[89:01] after 10K it starts to make sense to
[89:03] have Zenvo um so obviously that's
[89:06] targeting either people
[89:08] who yeah are making more money or
[89:12] there's um I didn't highlight this much
[89:14] in the lending page that some customers
[89:17] need to after they made the payments
[89:20] they realize they didn't provide provide
[89:22] their business uh details on it uh
[89:25] usually Europeans will need to have
[89:27] their uh vat number on top of it and
[89:30] that is something you cannot do with
[89:32] stripe invoicing the invoices are not
[89:34] editable so if someone asked to edit the
[89:36] invoice you would have to do it yourself
[89:38] which is very annoying and with invoice
[89:41] you can actually edit the invoice once
[89:43] is
[89:44] generated that could be an upsell for
[89:46] even someone who doesn't make much money
[89:48] with stripe but struggle with European
[89:50] customers that could be a a good selling
[89:56] point waiting for people to find me
[89:58] without per announcement or marketing
[89:59] three days ago Poland discovered a
[90:01] weather forecast website it's already
[90:04] plus 200 users per day that is very good
[90:07] that's a that's a shitload of visitors
[90:10] of users man 200 per day that's a
[90:15] lot all right I'm going to wrap up the
[90:17] stream uh this is the end
[90:20] of
[90:22] was that nine days building a little
[90:24] startup in public um thank you everyone
[90:26] who has been showing up thank you people
[90:28] whove been helping me debug my code uh
[90:31] thank you for the tips for headlines uh
[90:33] the copyrighting and all that that's uh
[90:35] that means a lot to me I hope this was
[90:37] somehow uh helpful for anyone who's been
[90:40] watching that I will keep doing these
[90:42] later this year I will from time to time
[90:44] cheap smaller product like this one that
[90:46] takes a week or two to build go live
[90:49] from uh the ID to the moments we launch
[90:52] um and hopefully we will have a product
[90:55] that will have a big hit and that would
[90:57] be fun right so that I wish you all um
[91:02] are shipping whatever this is I hope
[91:04] you're shipping and you bet I bet you
[91:06] are shipping so keep keep doing that and
