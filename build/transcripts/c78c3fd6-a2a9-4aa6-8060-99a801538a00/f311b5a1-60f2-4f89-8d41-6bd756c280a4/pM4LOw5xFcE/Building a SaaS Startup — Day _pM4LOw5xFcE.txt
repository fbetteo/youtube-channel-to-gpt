[00:28] you
[00:48] [Music]
[00:58] kind
[01:04] I'm going to fix the
[01:28] microphone
[01:45] watch visit
[01:51] getting
[01:58] this
[02:25] try
[02:26] this all right this is another try to
[02:29] see if that works any
[02:49] better okay good okay okay okay I think
[02:52] I don't need the microphone then it's
[02:54] weird this little thing [ __ ] it
[02:58] up
[03:08] okay okay so we're live on
[03:11] Twitter let's see that works on YouTube
[03:13] as well
[03:21] okay shut the
[03:24] up and maybe a little sorry I'm a total
[03:29] noob when it comes to OBS so trying to
[03:33] trying to make sure uh it's not terrible
[03:35] for you
[03:40] guys right can you guys let me know if
[03:44] uh the window is a good size if uh the
[03:49] sound is okay
[03:58] quality
[04:15] I do I do I do I do I have a YouTube
[04:17] live stream if you guys
[04:19] prefer
[04:28] YouTube
[04:32] think there's literally someone coming
[04:34] in my
[04:36] garden what is going on
[04:39] here right I'm going to pretend nothing
[04:41] is
[04:45] happening back
[04:58] and
[05:01] and I can see normally I should be able
[05:03] to
[05:04] shoot don't give
[05:06] a these are not
[05:10] messages can I see what you guys are
[05:12] doing okay so you know okay both good
[05:15] everything fter Twitter is lagging yeah
[05:19] I think that not be able to
[05:25] improve
[05:28] okay
[05:31] hello everyone uh sorry it took a little
[05:35] time well well back it's been I think
[05:37] it's been five month without any uh
[05:39] stream and uh kind of lacked some
[05:42] productivity last month I didn't do much
[05:44] and uh feel like you know going live is
[05:47] a good way to get things done so we're
[05:50] back uh this is uh if if you're from
[05:54] YouTube and you have no clue who I am I
[05:56] am marku and mostly build many startups
[06:00] on Twitter uh I have roughly 20 products
[06:05] uh live some of them are making money
[06:08] most of them are not making any money um
[06:12] and today I'm going to at least this
[06:14] week I'm going to try to create one new
[06:16] startup or a mini startup or product
[06:18] whatever this is called um this is going
[06:21] to be a
[06:23] stripe invoice uh generator and invoice
[06:27] Handler so the reason is uh I because of
[06:32] my products right now I receive emails
[06:34] from customers that want to have uh
[06:36] invoices I get confused sometimes which
[06:38] product they want to get the invoice
[06:40] sometime they want to edit the invoice
[06:41] like add their business details to it or
[06:44] some things that uh are tricky to make
[06:46] in stripe so the goal is to create a
[06:49] really tiny product that's connected to
[06:50] my stripe accounts and I would be able
[06:53] to send a link to customers they would
[06:55] find their invoice and if they want they
[06:57] can edit it themselves uh my friend Nico
[07:00] made something
[07:01] [Music]
[07:06] similar
[07:09] finally don't know where this is but
[07:11] anyway if you guys you you probably guys
[07:13] know Nico
[07:15] already he's made a invoice generator
[07:18] for his um uh course and the idea is to
[07:22] take this to a tiny uh higher level by
[07:26] letting anyone create an account and
[07:29] having your stripe account connected so
[07:31] the customers can already retrieve the
[07:33] invoice edited the way they want and so
[07:36] this again this is absolutely unscripted
[07:39] so I have no idea where I'm going I just
[07:41] have an ID for the the little product
[07:44] I'm making is going to be called
[07:47] Zenvo already purchased the domain
[07:51] name Zenvo it's literally someone in my
[07:54] garden God damn
[07:57] it the stream is already going wrong
[08:00] there's there's someone in my garden I
[08:01] have no idea
[08:03] what wait I got to cut this little thing
[08:06] I'll be
[08:28] back
[19:22] okay we are definitely
[19:25] back sorry this was a disaster
[19:31] live okay we're still alive sorry I just
[19:33] looked it up completely the people next
[19:36] to my house are gardening and they
[19:38] someone took off the a tree of mine that
[19:41] was literally going uh on their garden
[19:44] and instead of cutting them they just
[19:45] pull them so it's it ripped off a tree
[19:48] that is in my garden I just had to go
[19:51] there and make sure that uh it doesn't
[19:53] go too
[19:55] far all right uh okay I think think
[19:58] everything is still fine
[20:01] um okay cool sorry about that so I'll be
[20:06] back
[20:08] uh what we're we're going to be doing uh
[20:11] I think I'm going to spend about a week
[20:13] to build a mini product um it's going to
[20:16] be similar to buy dispute uh except that
[20:19] it's for generating invoices for
[20:21] customers on stripe so um quick recap if
[20:24] you haven't been here I have a couple uh
[20:26] startups live um some that are making
[20:30] money have customer support about people
[20:33] wanting wanting to have their invoice
[20:35] and sometimes people wants to have uh
[20:37] their invoice edited means they need to
[20:40] I don't know sometimes edit like the
[20:42] business details or they forget to add
[20:43] their business and they need to add
[20:44] their V8 number or something uh which is
[20:47] timeconsuming for me so I'm going to
[20:49] build this like really tiny tool where
[20:52] as a stripe business owner I can add all
[20:54] my stripe accounts I will have a unique
[20:57] link and whenever a customer ask for an
[21:00] invoice or edit an invoice I will send
[21:02] them the link and then a customer with
[21:04] their email they will be able to
[21:05] retrieve their invoices and edit them
[21:07] and download them uh so this is inspired
[21:10] by what my friend Nico did couple I
[21:13] think weeks ago a couple days ago uh I
[21:16] just went going to make this little
[21:18] product uh I am really bad at
[21:21] prototyping but to make things B clearer
[21:25] um so yeah this is unscripted I have
[21:27] nothing
[21:28] nothing is prepared um so I'm I'm
[21:31] literally going to build whatever I have
[21:34] this ID in mind I have no code prepared
[21:36] I'm going to be reusing pieces of code
[21:38] that I have uh I just bought a domain
[21:40] name I call the product Zenvo so it
[21:43] would be it's uh like a easy easy name
[21:47] to
[21:48] remember and we are going to do a little
[21:50] bit of
[21:51] drawing
[21:53] so we going to have like a try these
[21:57] owners
[22:00] that would be you that would be me that
[22:01] would be anyone who has uh one or
[22:04] multiple strip accounts and here we
[22:06] would have
[22:09] customers so as a strip business owner
[22:12] sometimes I need
[22:14] to I need to look so connect my STP
[22:23] accounts and get a so this is connect
[22:27] this is more like add or
[22:29] remove accounts and get
[22:40] a okay this is what the people will be
[22:44] able to do and then through this unique
[22:49] link they will send them to
[22:53] customers and so the customer can type
[22:56] in
[22:58] your
[23:04] email to retrieve
[23:09] invoice and finally edit
[23:13] invoice and
[23:15] finally download the
[23:24] invoice that is pretty much the gist of
[23:27] it
[23:29] this is a very simple
[23:34] product I think we can jump straight
[23:36] into the code uh if you guys are curious
[23:40] how that work uh for the unique link and
[23:42] connect the stripee account we're going
[23:43] to be using restricted API keys from
[23:46] stripe which will let my app request
[23:51] access
[23:52] to people stripe accounts with limited
[23:56] permissions what I'm using for by
[24:14] disputes yeah this is it so as so this
[24:18] is another product of mine that's using
[24:19] a
[24:21] similar uh you know like
[24:23] strictor here I can get a restricted API
[24:27] key
[24:29] and that will not I will not give the
[24:31] service the entire access to my uh strip
[24:35] account instead I'll choose which
[24:37] permissions they want to give access to
[24:41] and so in this case I don't and me
[24:43] especially as a business owner I don't
[24:44] want to access strap account the entire
[24:46] strap account of my customers I just
[24:48] want to make sure uh it's enough to
[24:50] generate invoices for their customers I
[24:52] want to use restricted API keys I don't
[24:54] want to mess up with u you know keys
[24:57] that could leak or something so I'd
[24:59] rather use those little restricted API
[25:01] Keys here this is
[25:06] it okay um yeah I'm wow it's been such a
[25:11] long time I haven't done a live stream
[25:14] uh is everything thanks to working okay
[25:17] it's
[25:19] live okay we're
[25:22] live is a part of me that doesn't
[25:24] believe it
[25:26] okay okay you don't see the screen
[25:37] okay
[25:39] code
[25:42] must the videos on
[25:44] YouTube get
[25:45] [Music]
[25:47] prefer prefer YouTube sh the
[25:53] link this is actually my first time
[25:55] broadcasting on Twitter
[25:59] and this is actually pretty
[26:19] [Music]
[26:21] nice I doing this
[26:26] right
[26:29] okay
[26:30] okay so okay
[26:35] yeah no that's the right thing okay all
[26:39] right time to
[26:42] build that's
[26:45] hard um and so I will so this this
[26:50] entire live stream uh will last I think
[26:53] about a week um I will go from I will
[26:56] build the landing page
[26:58] that will create the user dashboard
[27:01] login users process payment with stripes
[27:03] um send transactional emails if we need
[27:05] to I'll go I'll go I'll do the full
[27:08] stack thing um and I hope it can be done
[27:11] within a week and I think I'll hold the
[27:13] stream until we go launch on product T
[27:16] we actually managed to get this product
[27:18] off the ground which I don't even know
[27:20] I'm going to give it a try um yeah
[27:23] obviously I'm going to be using ship
[27:25] fast um which I built few month ago is
[27:29] going to speed things
[27:32] up there we go
[27:50] invoice oh and yeah one last thing I'm
[27:53] not really good at thinking and talking
[27:56] at the same time
[27:58] so I might go silence for a while when
[28:01] I'm
[28:21] cutting this is a quick setup normally
[28:24] so I'm going to be spending most of the
[28:26] time here on the editor if it's too
[28:29] small too big um let me
[28:33] know I don't know how you see this from
[28:35] your
[28:43] side okay that's the code I'm going to
[28:46] leave the screen on for just a few
[28:47] second I will check the chat let me know
[28:49] if if you guys can see the code
[28:52] properly before I jump straight
[28:56] in
[29:10] hey we have a troll in the YouTube chat
[29:13] make your box thing I think this person
[29:15] should be
[29:16] banned Manu oh we have the is the team
[29:19] is the hero fit team
[29:21] Manu yo everyone okay so it looks like
[29:24] you guys can see my my screen
[29:27] good enough
[29:34] video yep for that I don't know we'll
[29:36] see I guess we'll see at the end of this
[29:39] stream
[29:56] okay
[30:04] all
[30:13] right all right so there there are a few
[30:15] things that needs to be done I think
[30:17] we'll do the copywriting for the
[30:19] learning page after I need to have a
[30:21] little clue of what the product will do
[30:23] because I might not I'm not even sure we
[30:24] can do everything that I imagined
[30:27] so uh I will try to build a really tiny
[30:31] version of the product hopefully today
[30:32] or tomorrow and then once this is done I
[30:36] think we'll do the branding the colors
[30:39] um and all that after I think I'll will
[30:42] make a very tiny version of the product
[30:43] because it's actually pretty simple so
[30:44] I'm going to start with that
[30:48] so go back to figma
[30:51] um yeah one user would have couple
[30:54] stripe accounts so yeah I think I'll
[30:55] reuse the code from by thisp
[31:11] okay okay yeah will need so
[31:18] need somewhere
[31:26] here
[31:50] that's do we need no we don't need to
[31:52] listen to
[31:56] REM
[32:17] pleas that should be enough I think we
[32:19] don't need
[32:26] this
[32:34] think we don't need this
[32:36] okay this
[32:40] thing hey
[32:45] um yeah in order to log in I think I
[32:49] need to set up my environment variables
[32:51] I'm going to be using going have to hi
[32:53] this for a little while going to use um
[32:57] other variables that I use for other
[33:00] startups for
[33:03] now making sure that I'm not lecking my
[33:06] my
[33:25] variables
[33:46] okay we're back I just set up my
[33:49] environment variables just so that it
[33:51] can log in
[33:55] users
[33:59] yeah I think so we're going to get rid
[34:01] of Google oath I think we're going to
[34:03] sign users only with emails for this
[34:11] one so because I have set up emails for
[34:15] other projects I already have my
[34:19] Parables config here I can already send
[34:22] emails and normally if I go in my
[34:24] mailbox I should be able to find
[34:29] okay all right so I am signed
[34:34] up this is
[34:38] me right so here what we want is we want
[34:41] to let
[34:42] users add STP accounts so that their
[34:46] customers will be able to search their
[34:48] invoices for each STP accounts that the
[34:51] business owner
[34:53] owns um I think I built this for bu
[35:06] this
[35:15] one we're going to copy that button it's
[35:18] just a little I think it's a little
[35:19] model let me lets the user create a new
[35:25] uh add a new
[35:41] account oh yep I'll need that
[35:54] thing I'm also going to create a little
[35:56] f
[35:57] I'll explain in details later how to
[35:59] create restricted API keys for
[36:02] stripe for now I need to create some
[36:04] kind of like Le
[36:17] helper so here what what we have here is
[36:19] a list of permissions that when the
[36:22] person will click on add a new strip
[36:26] account it's going to open stripe for
[36:29] the user and it's going to prefill some
[36:32] of the permissions that are required
[36:35] to get the right API key so in some
[36:40] cases you want to be able to write uh
[36:43] new webbook things for your customer so
[36:45] you might need this permission one in
[36:47] our case we won't need it um there a
[36:50] bunch of permissions the the
[36:52] documentation is not very clear there
[36:54] are bunch of permissions that you can uh
[36:55] request um I will have to think about
[36:58] which one we request for our app but for
[37:00] now I'm going to just create a URL that
[37:02] is going to open strip
[37:05] dashboard API Keys create name
[37:10] using
[37:13] invoice okay normally
[37:19] [Music]
[37:25] here
[37:41] I
[37:42] mess I think I imported the wrong
[37:55] button
[38:02] oh yeah okay Import in the wrong
[38:05] button like
[38:08] edit okay that's the
[38:19] one
[38:25] cl
[38:37] change all that
[38:55] later
[39:22] we need the
[39:25] model this is just going to be the model
[39:27] where customer can input restricted API
[39:41] key is that
[39:55] it
[39:58] user
[40:00] credit oh yeah I think we won't have any
[40:04] credit in this app so we can remove
[40:21] it okay this is
[40:25] working
[40:29] I'm going to check if that
[40:36] works okay there we go so what do we
[40:40] have here so there is this uh
[40:42] component I'm going to remove that part
[40:45] because we don't need the entire API key
[40:47] but here there is this link if I click
[40:50] on it it sends the user to the stripe
[40:55] dashboard it creates a restricted API
[40:58] key with the name of my app already and
[41:00] some pretty fine permissions so here for
[41:02] charges I already if the user accepts I
[41:05] will have write permission for charges
[41:08] and read permission for customers I
[41:10] think I will keep this one and then at
[41:12] the bottom I would have to click create
[41:15] key which will give me an API key like
[41:18] with a bunch of numbers and then I will
[41:20] just past it here in
[41:24] Bingo um
[41:27] yeah okay so now I need to make
[41:41] this maybe I just keep the exact same
[41:55] layout
[42:06] all right I think here we
[42:11] can I think there is someone at the
[42:25] door
[42:55] grosseries
[42:58] is that
[43:01] enough yeah I think it'll be enough for
[43:12] now all right that will be enough okay
[43:14] so we'll get the stri from this
[43:20] for we need to save it
[43:23] somewhere nextra
[43:34] he working
[43:36] yep I'm going to reuse the code also I
[43:40] have there conect
[43:43] strip copy past
[43:55] tting
[44:05] models we have the
[44:06] [Music]
[44:08] user we probably won't be we might be
[44:12] using
[44:22] this oh okay so here we we're calling
[44:25] the stripe AP okay I need to
[44:32] have we already have those helper
[44:34] function no we don't have those need to
[44:37] pick them up retrieve account those are
[44:40] just
[44:42] um little helper functions to um connect
[44:46] with this do stuff with the stripe API
[44:49] here we're going to retrieve the
[44:50] [Music]
[44:51] accounts make sure this is the account
[44:54] on stripe exists and make sure the
[44:56] account was not added by someone
[45:02] else yeah also for Branding um it's
[45:07] simple because I already have the code
[45:09] but I
[45:10] can get the logo of the user stripe
[45:13] account so that's when the person
[45:15] connects the when a potential C like
[45:17] when a customer of my customers will go
[45:19] on the page to get their invoice they
[45:22] could see the name of the the strap
[45:24] account the logo of the strap account so
[45:25] we create some branding and it's already
[45:28] here so we're going to keep it this
[45:33] way oh okay I deleted it but I shouldn't
[45:36] have
[45:46] okay yeah those little thing here we get
[45:50] them from stripe and we get the primary
[45:52] color of stripe support
[45:54] email information that can be helpful
[46:00] later and then we add it to the user and
[46:03] we save the user we
[46:05] don't create a Web
[46:10] book
[46:13] and
[46:14] works oh we have a delete function as
[46:20] well I'm basically rediscovering my code
[46:23] from
[46:24] November
[46:31] remove
[46:35] the okay we have two functions we added
[46:38] two functions one two API routes One
[46:41] lets the user add a strap account to
[46:43] their account and the other one let user
[46:46] delete the strap account and so normally
[46:49] if I go
[46:51] here create a restricted API key with
[46:55] probably the wrong permissions for now
[46:57] but just to give it a try we check the
[46:59] database everything is fine see here um
[47:02] Zenvo API key was Crea I'm copy paste
[47:06] it go
[47:08] back be
[47:10] here of course it's not working yeah
[47:14] credits need to oh yeah don't about oh
[47:19] maybe oh the payment thing I haven't
[47:21] thought about it yeah okay we're going
[47:22] to remove these for
[47:24] now I don't care
[47:28] and the key is it still
[47:43] working oh
[47:50] May
[47:54] no nuts
[48:27] oh I think I didn't put it at the place
[48:30] yep it should
[48:33] be oh yeah
[48:38] okay
[48:39] [Music]
[48:54] user
[49:03] yep yep
[49:05] yep because on the user model we don't
[49:09] have we don't have the stripe account
[49:14] thing it this is going to be an array on
[49:17] the user model that's going to for all
[49:21] the IDS of every stripe
[49:24] account
[49:28] I think this one is going to
[49:33] work oh okay I think yep I added
[49:39] it this is a local database
[49:43] MB find which those is the right
[49:54] one voice there we
[49:56] go so we have STP accounts we already
[50:00] added
[50:01] it time
[50:08] finally all right bingo so Tri account
[50:12] was added to the database we have the
[50:14] restricted access token that we're going
[50:16] to be using later to retrieve customers
[50:19] information we have some information
[50:22] primary color this is null because it's
[50:25] a test account for now but later here
[50:27] there should be the logo the primary
[50:30] color the business name so we have some
[50:32] information to display and we don't have
[50:33] to get those information from people on
[50:37] the dashboard we directly get get it
[50:38] from stri to make it super
[50:41] simple then normally here I have my user
[50:44] Mark glue with Y my variable populated
[50:49] with is it yeah it big enough know maybe
[50:54] this is really tiny
[51:10] hey ho hey that's the little Twitter
[51:12] family here Andre you're my
[51:15] friend live on yeah you could do I
[51:17] didn't know too it's pretty it's pretty
[51:19] nice live on Twitter and
[51:24] YouTube
[51:30] man I want to reply so
[51:34] bad
[51:37] okay so we have the database populated
[51:41] um now we want to show the startups to
[51:45] the
[51:47] user going to be doing Brer or refresh
[51:50] yeah we need to have somewhere in the
[51:53] dashboard we need to show a link least
[51:57] of the accounts the user add
[52:01] added um that's it's very similar again
[52:06] what I did before copy pass the code one
[52:09] more
[52:21] time data and we
[52:24] have
[52:56] I'm going
[52:57] to
[53:14] more we do
[53:24] here
[53:27] and here we are going to display so we
[53:29] are
[53:30] getting the data on it's a it's a server
[53:34] component we're getting the data from
[53:36] the database here basically fetching all
[53:39] the accounts the user own and populating
[53:42] them so we have data about them and here
[53:45] we're going to display
[53:54] them
[53:56] give me some magic J here we
[54:00] go okay here STP
[54:13] accounts actually
[54:17] pret oh I think we can even create a
[54:20] component for that because the user
[54:21] should be able to delete
[54:24] those accounts just in
[54:46] case new components going to call it
[54:49] just stripe accounts is going to
[54:52] be a display of the stripe data plus um
[54:56] a way to delete
[55:24] it can make to the
[55:25] [Music]
[55:54] dashboard
[57:07] oh okay
[57:15] yeah
[57:23] okay
[57:36] time to copy past
[57:38] everything much
[57:53] simpler
[58:10] we can delete the
[58:20] accounts
[58:23] okay
[58:26] have this here
[58:28] and account here
[58:32] okay we have a basic very
[58:36] basic user dashboard where people once
[58:39] they're logged in they can add rep
[58:41] accounts with the restricted API key the
[58:43] account appears here person can edit the
[58:46] key I think I'm going to remove that
[58:48] part once yeah I think I'm going to
[58:50] remove it but anyway and delete it
[59:17] enough
[59:23] pict
[59:47] okay yeah I need to buy a new internet
[59:52] connection oh wow
[59:55] hello everyone so
[60:04] cool there's a chat
[60:07] okay oh that's
[60:09] cool it makes Twitter and YouTube
[60:12] comments that is
[60:18] nice it keeps buffering so maybe if
[60:23] that
[60:26] yeah maybe that's a restream problem
[60:28] maybe that's not
[60:38] actually anyway if YouTube is working at
[60:40] least there is
[60:44] something
[60:53] yep
[60:55] all
[60:58] right
[61:11] validation right now I'm I'm going to
[61:14] create special link so that once you
[61:18] have added your strap accounts you can
[61:19] send that link to
[61:21] customers and and we're going to be
[61:23] building there but yeah the idea is I
[61:26] don't know if I should make
[61:29] a
[61:31] link page that is statically generated
[61:34] or a page that
[61:35] fetches whatever let me
[61:53] think
[62:17] what we're going to be
[62:19] doing okay we're going to go here we're
[62:22] going to create a folder hold
[62:29] p and in that folder we're going to
[62:33] create a I think user
[62:38] ID which will be the
[62:42] parameter let me search
[62:46] figma I'm going to get the unique link
[62:48] and I
[62:49] think we want that link to be something
[62:53] like
[63:02] I.P
[63:07] s we we can change that later eventually
[63:10] but the idea would be this this would be
[63:13] your private link that you can send to
[63:16] customers where they could find their
[63:23] invo
[63:26] right does anyone has an an idea if that
[63:31] is better to do with this way is a uh
[63:35] static
[63:37] page whatever static
[63:40] page
[63:46] or or
[63:48] a dynamic
[63:50] [Music]
[63:52] whatever I don't know how that called
[63:55] end
[63:56] page something like this
[63:59] where
[64:07] P
[64:09] this in one case in this case the page
[64:13] is created on the server and then it
[64:15] sends by direct to the client with
[64:17] already all the stripe accounts or it's
[64:21] a page that is the same for everyone and
[64:24] then on the clients it checks the he
[64:27] check it checks the
[64:30] ID here make a request to the ser and
[64:34] when the user input the
[64:37] email and I have so much respect for
[64:39] people doing live when coding this is so
[64:41] hard I cannot even think my brain is
[64:46] numb hopefully you get
[64:48] me if you didn't I will just move on
[64:51] with one or the other let me check
[64:58] literally feel
[65:03] like yeah the recording will be on
[65:10] YouTube I think I
[65:14] should okay link is here if you guys on
[65:17] Twitter uh want to see a offline version
[65:19] of this the link is right
[65:23] underneath
[65:25] sta would work
[65:27] okay last
[65:29] boss static would work so we're going to
[65:32] go
[65:35] static um yeah here we go P user ID and
[65:39] here is going to be a
[65:52] page going to see how SM is GitHub
[65:59] copilot page
[66:19] displays inut at the
[66:23] bottom
[66:34] uh coding in 2000 no you're no GitHub no
[66:39] yeah I don't give me that information
[66:43] um
[66:53] pleas
[67:12] what okay okay I'll be a bit too
[67:22] optimistic
[67:52] uh
[67:58] haven't done much
[68:01] um however this is called when pages are
[68:05] as aeter and you generate like basically
[68:07] get static path in
[68:09] nextjs I used to use the P
[68:13] the pages router but for the app router
[68:18] I'm
[68:21] not with it so
[68:26] not
[68:37] this
[68:40] okay do I know how many pages will be
[68:43] generated from
[68:52] this
[69:03] CRA I haven't looked at this piece of
[69:05] cod for like three three months and I
[69:06] don't remember how this
[69:16] [Music]
[69:22] works
[70:10] generate
[70:11] itic right
[70:15] here okay we can remove the
[70:18] block
[70:22] this
[70:28] we will need to make a page for
[70:33] each page for accounts that was
[70:39] created and we need to
[70:41] find yeah
[70:43] [Music]
[70:52] users
[70:58] is this going to
[71:04] work yeah we don't
[71:22] care
[72:13] normally that
[72:14] [Music]
[72:22] user
[72:26] probably not going to
[72:34] work oh yeah
[72:44] okay
[72:47] okay L is a bit weird though oh okay
[72:50] okay
[72:52] okay
[73:07] um oh maybe I don't have to return oh
[73:10] yeah I think I have to return user ID oh
[73:13] okay okay now that's working okay so we
[73:16] have a
[73:19] page for each user okay okay now we
[73:23] going to get so we
[73:25] here this is a page that's going to face
[73:29] anyone on the internet potentially so we
[73:31] need to return only the
[73:33] data no restricted API key for
[73:36] instance I'll make
[73:42] sure this private
[73:48] okay so here we're going to
[73:51] get all the strip accounts that the user
[73:58] owns a get data
[74:09] function
[74:22] this
[74:32] counts let's see we got okay we
[74:36] got the stri counts I think we want
[74:39] actually we want to render yeah we just
[74:41] want to render the stri
[74:48] accounts this is going to
[74:52] work
[75:10] oh yeah actually wait yeah I should have
[75:12] done
[75:15] that
[75:19] do
[75:22] oh
[75:24] each account we
[75:37] render I think it's actually best if we
[75:40] just search the trp accounts the
[75:43] username
[75:45] so
[75:46] [Music]
[75:49] account
[75:52] do
[75:54] can
[76:05] lean
[76:08] work oh
[76:12] yeah oh
[76:22] [ __ ]
[76:52] okay
[76:56] turn the
[76:57] array and here we can
[77:00] say
[77:02] count
[77:05] here okay and here we're going to
[77:15] display each we're going to have like
[77:19] a
[77:20] [Music]
[77:22] invoice
[77:30] oh
[77:48] wait we don't even need to get the STP
[77:52] accounts we can get that later when we
[77:54] make the call I think here we just need
[77:56] to get
[77:58] the user
[78:17] email we didn't need that but
[78:20] anyway we need a button
[78:24] [Music]
[78:26] customer
[78:32] emails opy
[78:43] that we need to
[78:51] get
[79:19] waight Le we would say
[79:21] something
[79:30] Point can
[79:51] going
[80:17] maybe that's not best way to do it
[80:21] because so customer will put their
[80:22] invoice in the form it's going to make a
[80:25] call to the API to
[80:30] retrieve all potential customers with
[80:33] that email from the STP
[80:36] account and then we're going to display
[80:38] the
[80:42] invoices probably I need to make this
[80:45] thing
[80:48] here and
[80:50] components not like this need
[80:54] the server
[81:21] components oh okay
[81:23] okay yeah I'm kind of new to next year
[81:26] Brer
[81:28] so maybe we leave it as a server
[81:31] component and then we pass on everything
[81:34] to some kind of a sub
[81:46] component
[81:49] um we don't need that
[81:57] here think we're going to
[82:12] call think we're going to create a big
[82:16] component component that's going to
[82:21] be in Voice
[82:51] page
[83:02] this is going to be a client
[83:08] component
[83:10] that I think we're going to throw
[83:11] everything at these
[83:13] components so we need
[83:21] um
[83:23] this component here we need to get user
[83:30] email we need to be able to search query
[83:34] API to get
[83:45] invoices
[83:49] display play
[83:51] invoices
[83:53] and we are going to add a
[83:55] button to
[83:58] download each
[84:02] invoice and button to edit each
[84:08] invoice that's pretty
[84:10] much with this
[84:21] component
[84:27] use both clients
[84:47] and
[84:51] okay
[84:55] we
[85:18] things yeah
[85:21] okay
[85:25] is the
[85:26] function uh to
[85:32] get and
[85:40] the
[85:45] it's
[85:46] [Music]
[85:51] four
[86:28] okay here in the thing we get the user
[86:31] ID which we're going to pass later on we
[86:35] need to
[86:38] email need to disable the
[86:51] thing type in the
[86:54] email we need to create a route that
[86:57] anyone can
[86:58] use that is going to get user ID and the
[87:03] email email and we'll need to pass the
[87:05] user
[87:09] idea also here we're going to have a
[87:12] list of
[87:15] invoices
[87:21] invoices
[88:51] okay
[89:17] okay think I need a
[89:20] tee
[89:28] barely see my face [ __ ] oh wait
[89:30] actually I'm pretty small so maybe that
[89:31] would make sense my audio issue
[89:40] damn um how bad is that thing let me

[99:22] yeah we get quy
[99:25] okay find all the stripe accounts user
[99:29] ID that's
[99:30] correct
[99:35] and yeah that sounds about
[99:39] right we're going to do this for
[99:44] each
[99:47] account look for invoices with the user
[99:52] email to
[100:05] e each
[100:12] trip perf but
[100:19] this
[100:27] all right the Fun Party begins now we
[100:29] can to around with a stri
[100:35] API
[100:43] search do qu
[100:49] language
[100:54] okay if you're joining um we are making
[100:58] a simple invoice Retriever and editor
[101:01] for stripe so people will get a page
[101:06] customers will get a page like this
[101:09] one invoice blah blah blah with an
[101:14] ID and then this is basically going to
[101:18] query R API
[101:28] I am very talented at growing as you can
[101:31] see
[101:48] on well this is
[101:54] beautiful
[101:56] drawing now we're doing this part here
[102:00] we have the user
[102:01] email and we are going to query for each
[102:04] trp account we are going to
[102:06] query the API and try to get all the
[102:09] invoices that the customer had made for
[102:12] the
[102:13] business
[102:18] so the data
[102:26] should we get customers typ invoices
[102:31] wait
[102:45] inv maybe
[102:47] invoices be
[102:49] interesting
[102:54] search
[102:57] query we can do something like this
[102:59] probably and we search with a query
[103:02] language I think probably using
[103:06] emails there we
[103:11] go get bunch of
[103:18] invoices uh
[103:29] here we
[103:33] go so you're live on

[106:28] invoice I think I will have to rebuild
[106:30] the entire
[106:32] invoice as it looks on
[106:49] stri
[107:07] here let's TR let's create a rout and
[107:10] see where we go with
[107:13] that so we need to
[107:18] create three we need to create
[107:23] something retrieve
[107:27] invoices wow I love
[107:30] it I think we're going to limit to 30
[107:40] and
[107:42] that's
[107:46] much inves this custom okay
[108:02] see if didn't do any
[108:05] bug found that would make sense I think
[108:08] I will have to create a strap
[108:10] account I'll have to connect
[108:13] to fre yeah
[108:15] okay let me show
[108:19] you
[108:29] test mode I think in these account we've
[108:32] made
[108:33] already a
[108:35] few payments think I tested the product
[108:38] few times yeah we have a few fake
[108:41] customers
[108:44] here which is good now we need to create
[108:47] the API key so let's see how our app is
[108:50] working for
[108:54] them this is working perfectly here we
[108:59] go why did you work
[109:16] here what are we
[109:19] done
[109:20] oh
[109:47] wait okay this is working this is an
[109:50] ugly dashboard we're going to work on
[109:52] that later for now I'm going to try to
[109:54] create a new restricted API key
[110:01] for okay so this is a different strip
[110:04] account I'm going to create a stripe
[110:06] restricted stripe Aki key for my app
[110:09] called
[110:11] Zenvo create the key at the bottom I
[110:14] might not have the right permissions for
[110:15] now have to check on that later here get
[110:19] the key
[110:21] C past
[110:23] it
[110:24] and we have a new account this is the
[110:28] one here and so
[110:31] normally
[110:36] normally I think
[110:49] it's
[110:51] start again um you know what I'm going
[110:53] to make a button because that's bit
[110:55] annoying on the dashboard I want to have
[111:03] L I think a strip account and
[111:07] [Music]
[111:10] here want to get my link so here it this
[111:14] is going to
[111:18] be
[111:56] Local
[112:04] Host
[112:07] plus
[112:09] b
[112:18] e
[112:24] slash slash the
[112:28] user ID
[112:34] is any
[112:46] M and we're going to underline that
[112:49] thing
[112:53] okay that's the link customers will
[112:59] share again I'm not doing any styling
[113:02] here just making things work normally I
[113:05] get okay I get this link so customer
[113:06] will see this and if I didn't mess up
[113:10] normally I should be able to get the
[113:13] invoice of course not I should normally
[113:16] be able to get some of those invoices
[113:18] here if I type my
[113:30] email okay yeah I have a bunch of emails
[113:33] here payments made under my name a lot
[113:36] of money on my own
[113:44] business let's see that we didn't mess
[113:47] up anywhere need to console
[113:52] L
[113:53] [Music]
[113:54] accounts and email what we
[113:59] go actually that's also bit boring I'm
[114:02] going to stop removing the email from
[114:05] the
[114:08] form
[114:12] here
[114:16] and again invoices
[114:20] I think I'm not calling the right
[114:25] API okay yeah we're not even calling the
[114:27] API R so that wouldn't
[114:30] work oh we're going to post to use
[114:34] um
[114:37] customers it's
[114:43] voice and it is going to be I think a
[114:46] get uh
[114:48] actually
[114:50] yep that should be a get another a plus
[114:59] here there we
[115:04] go as it is
[115:09] [Music]
[115:13] undefined
[115:18] oh
[115:37] do I get the query bar
[115:48] out
[116:03] request oh I think that's somewhere in
[116:14] here there we go next
[116:16] [Music]
[116:18] URL
[116:41] working
[116:45] [Music]
[116:48] here
[117:08] getting
[117:18] rusty
[117:31] y
[117:33] Moran he's a stri
[117:39] fanboy
[117:48] yeah
[118:40] okay okay we got something we're now
[118:42] calling
[118:44] the else do we get inv request
[118:48] here
[118:50] provide an API key okay let's work on
[118:54] that we
[118:58] are okay invoices
[119:01] promise
[119:09] map access
[119:18] token
[119:28] try
[119:35] again not working what else do
[119:39] we Okay does not have the record
[119:41] permission okay this is where the R
[119:47] Credit okay this Cur this is where it
[119:50] gets interesting so earlier we added
[119:53] restricted API keys to the
[119:56] account and by default I've enabled some
[120:00] permissions so I think we don't need to
[120:02] write we going we're going to rewrite
[120:04] the permissions we need from those Tri
[120:08] so in stripe here they're telling me
[120:12] that I need this
[120:14] permission need to
[120:18] write
[120:20] you don't need to I need to write files
[120:25] I get the logo there was something like
[120:27] this I remember we don't need to write
[120:30] subscriptions at
[120:32] all this also for some information and
[120:38] read okay we're going to create a second
[120:40] API
[120:43] key we need to
[120:48] remove
[120:57] eight and what is the permission with it
[121:00] Credit Credit
[121:12] notes probably need
[121:15] invoices I'm sure I'm pretty sure anyway
[121:20] will be telling me but I'm pretty sure
[121:21] we need
[121:25] this and leave
[121:29] know be waiting for the
[121:33] striction
[121:36] message we have the account we go back
[121:46] page okay right credit note read yeah
[121:49] what I
[121:52] just I reading the right
[122:01] message yeah that's the
[122:07] one I didn't refresh this
[122:16] right it's yeah I do have the right
[122:25] read oh I think oh I know why okay
[122:30] because of the first accounts that
[122:31] didn't have the right
[122:36] permissions okay I delete that one
[122:45] is yeah we get a different era now see
[122:48] unknown parameter customer email did you
[122:50] mean customer
[122:58] yes
[123:17] here
[123:21] invoices my list what is the difference
[123:23] with
[123:24] this is that
[123:30] something no list doesn't exist
[123:35] right okay this my G of copilot getting
[123:38] tired I
[123:40] guess so we are going back to the
[123:43] searching stripe invoices
[123:47] search
[123:55] email think that's how stripe handle
[123:59] their
[124:00] and a
[124:04] limit but
[124:06] think
[124:08] I
[124:10] don't example query
[124:17] above
[124:38] you have properly puted values okay
[124:47] put
[125:08] still not
[125:14] working email is
[125:17] unsupported
[125:25] okay it is not supported
[125:28] see can build a product f for invoice
[125:31] currency is
[125:34] customer no no no no no no
[125:36] no oh
[125:42] [ __ ] okay I
[125:47] think
[125:51] okay I think then so we cannot query by
[125:53] email so I think we have to query
[125:55] customers first and then get all the
[125:58] invoices from the
[126:01] customer very feels
[126:04] for okay we can query by what is that
[126:10] thing why does it
[126:13] have
[126:14] this
[126:16] okay we query the customer
[126:22] we
[126:31] get okay then we going to
[126:35] get
[126:38] here
[126:47] invoice
[126:56] we create the customers and we need to
[126:58] get the invoices for for customers
[127:01] but I don't
[127:04] get return to
[127:10] data it's weird because we need to get
[127:13] customers all the invoices from the
[127:17] customer I'm not
[127:24] sure
[127:26] object
[127:29] um
[127:32] perix oh otherwise okay we get all the
[127:34] customers and then we get the customer
[127:37] ID and we cry invoices by customer ID I
[127:41] think that's is going to be this
[127:46] way gra for invoices customer okay we
[127:49] can do that
[127:51] good we
[128:10] need for each account we
[128:15] retrieve
[128:17] so
[128:19] per account one or more
[128:23] customers and each customer one or more
[128:27] invoices
[128:30] retrieve
[128:33] here least we retrieve the customer and
[128:37] customers uh customers data okay
[128:40] retrieve invoices here we don't need the
[128:42] email but we need the
[128:44] customer
[128:47] need
[128:52] and invoices search
[128:54] [Music]
[128:55] query here should
[128:56] [Music]
[129:02] be
[129:06] okay
[129:07] Bingo going back here in the
[129:11] routes
[129:15] it's
[129:17] invoice here for each rep
[129:20] account
[129:39] luk
[129:40] email each and for each customer all the
[129:46] invoices give me some magic
[130:00] think let's see if we do have something
[130:03] that's
[130:11] works
[130:17] iello
[130:21] you did not provide an API key H what do
[130:24] we have Yep this is access toen
[130:30] man you know
[130:44] that
[130:47] and
[130:51] wow no
[130:52] errors that is something
[130:56] already um L the customers see okay we
[131:00] have
[131:00] customers there we go this is
[131:08] good and we have a list of customers and
[131:11] each customer as ID so for each
[131:13] customers we're going to map over each
[131:15] of them re
[131:17] invoices
[131:19] and pass on the customer ID something
[131:23] went wrong I think in that
[131:37] function we
[131:39] make might be a bunch of
[131:46] them is it how it's supposed
[132:00] to oh where did I
[132:04] MPE
[132:15] invoices inv
[132:17] is
[132:21] query a random
[132:23] query instead of
[132:41] this that is literally the example
[132:45] here amount is unsupported
[132:50] sear what are you talking
[133:03] about go back to that STP accounts and
[133:06] see how
[133:16] many
[133:38] three
[133:46] rhms
[134:00] this is
[134:08] literally
[134:11] someone
[134:14] a what you're building yep every um the
[134:18] details are in the description have a
[134:25] look yeah we will do an invoice
[134:27] generator
[134:31] stripe maybe that's not the clearest
[134:46] descri
[134:54] you're telling
[135:11] me Oh is this actually
[135:16] working wait
[135:18] yeah this is working
[135:20] wow
[135:29] beautiful wait where did I mess up
[135:46] um
[135:58] we have invoices
[136:01] [Music]
[136:10] um okay so this is an object
[136:15] okay so invo the data
[136:18] in the
[136:23] area right
[136:46] here
[136:56] oh I think I'm not
[137:10] yep all right okay we
[137:14] got we
[137:16] get oh okay yeah
[137:35] do
[137:46] something
[137:48] we can do is
[137:54] push and we send back those
[137:57] invoices
[137:59] here um let simply show those
[138:16] invoices
[138:22] okay if that's going to
[138:24] work no
[138:27] invoices still not
[138:32] work get inv
[138:46] voice
[138:57] oh
[138:58] maybe oh yeah okay
[139:16] okay
[139:20] if is
[139:25] it oh
[139:46] yeah
[140:45] what am I doing
[140:53] oh yeah of course F components not going
[140:56] to go far if I don't search
[140:59] okay oh damn
[141:07] it now we going to have okay we have the
[141:16] invoices
[141:19] but this those are the invoices although
[141:22] this is a bit strange because I think
[141:33] much uh yeah there's 70
[141:46] invoices
[142:16] B
[142:35] is it possible that we have so few
[142:42] invoices any duplicates no they are not
[142:44] duplicates those are
[142:52] let's go
[143:16] back
[143:25] see this from the
[143:27] beginning any customers we have found 10
[143:29] customers back okay I think the problem
[143:32] is then customers I believe this is
[143:36] possible under my
[143:39] email maybe he didn't
[143:46] create
[144:01] oh maybe it's because I didn't add a Oh
[144:04] by default maybe there is a
[144:07] limit oh I think that's probably
[144:14] why yep customers least oh I think this
[144:16] is
[144:18] it I mean it's unlikely that a customers
[144:21] would have purchased more than 10 times
[144:23] for a bus or maybe a subscription maybe
[144:26] a monthly
[144:32] subscription customer is okay and the
[144:34] limit it's by 10 by default default is
[144:37] said okay right the limit
[144:41] to whatever
[144:45] 100
[144:47] and then we should get more 53 customers
[144:55] okay oh [ __ ] we hit the rate
[145:00] limit
[145:12] um is the rate limit on
[145:15] strip
[145:30] 20 operations per
[145:39] second
[145:42] C Business no no I think actually that
[145:45] makes sense we don't need to we
[145:48] have we just need one eventually yeah
[145:51] okay there will never be actually no no
[145:53] there will never be more than 10
[145:55] customers actually they should never be
[145:57] more than
[145:58] one so we can leave it this way for the
[146:01] invoices though there might be more
[146:05] mightbe 10 or
[146:07] something it should be at least one
[146:09] invoice per customer so there is no
[146:11] limit
[146:11] here right I think this is working I'm
[146:15] going to be testing this live later but
[146:17] I think this
[146:29] is all right now we're going
[146:33] to do that think I will have to recreate
[146:37] stripe invoices
[146:39] UI so that customers can edit them this
[146:43] this is a bit uh of a some hard work but
[146:48] I think that's the only way I can do
[146:50] it I look here I don't
[146:56] think let's see what we get when we send
[146:59] the invoices
[147:01] back invoices
[147:05] data we get those invoices
[147:08] invoice information is
[147:11] the I don't think there is
[147:14] a there's no link
[147:17] hosted oh we have a hosting oh that's
[147:19] nice oh actually
[147:28] maybe okay that's pretty
[147:34] cool we have the invoice PDF
[147:40] Bingo right that should make
[147:43] things
[147:45] simp
[147:48] so okay good good good normally
[147:52] uh
[147:53] [Music]
[148:15] Buton
[148:45] and
[148:47] create a link that will download the
[148:48] invoice
[149:15] automatically
[149:36] search uh voice oh no the rate
[149:41] limiter tyy voice yet uh send me give it
[149:45] to me where are those
[149:57] voices uh
[150:01] yep oh okay maybe there is
[150:11] there back 10 invoices what are you
[150:13] talking
[150:15] about
[150:50] where are
[151:07] those
[151:10] oh
[151:15] okay
[151:43] all right and here what do we have
[151:46] going to download The Voice yes
[151:50] sir here we
[151:53] go this is
[151:56] good we can retrieve invoices download
[152:01] them see if we can
[152:06] edit
[152:15] and
[153:02] yeah that's the
[153:15] problem
[153:23] oopsy
[153:27] doopsy I think yeah we have to
[153:30] recreate
[153:45] invo we'll need to recreate the invoice
[153:47] because we can download
[153:50] it we
[153:52] can't edit it for
[153:59] now I have all those
[154:05] invoices but if I want to add my
[154:07] business details to it I'm
[154:15] screwed is
[154:23] it yeah that could be
[154:26] a that could be tomorrow stream let's
[154:29] see 15 more minutes I'll do little
[154:35] something let's see if I can give a pre
[154:38] invoice feeling to those
[154:45] stuff
[155:00] display the
[155:15] invoices
[155:20] [Music]
[155:44] one
[156:02] room for
[156:14] the
[156:32] have a
[156:32] [Music]
[156:36] button get rid of
[156:39] this I think we just going to recreate
[156:42] the stripe UI for
[156:44] that frequency invoice
[157:04] number em email already delete du
[157:11] and
[157:14] create
[157:21] and we are have a
[157:44] button
[157:54] come on get give me
[158:02] something my GitHub did we even
[158:05] connected to the
[158:07] internet
[158:09] live I'm here yes I'm
[158:12] here yeah the connection didn't drop
[158:18] okay we're still
[158:23] live
[158:27] connection sound is really bad
[158:35] okay pretty
[158:38] bad um anyone else could confirm how the
[158:42] sound is just to make sure I don't touch
[158:45] the mic if it's not worth
[158:57] it ah
[159:14] okay uh
[159:16] a few test
[159:32] sorry all right I'm trying this new
[159:35] setup uh let me know if it's
[159:40] better
[159:44] okay
[159:49] okay yeah I think it's probably one of
[159:51] the filters I
[160:01] use all right you let me know if that's
[160:04] uh worse or or better this should should
[160:07] hear me better but you might hear some
[160:10] maybe some sounds from my uh AC or
[160:14] something
[160:25] no of
[160:44] not
[160:59] invoice
[161:06] number two dates
[161:14] baby
[161:16] I can zoom on
[161:19] that oh yeah I can zoom
[161:44] cool
[161:49] I don't care about
[161:52] that let's
[161:57] see okay
[162:02] um currency the currency the
[162:14] currency
[162:18] you
[162:21] attemped currency
[162:23] USD I think I'll need a library currency
[162:27] string to
[162:44] sign
[162:48] no
[162:51] be really
[162:55] optimistic if anyone knows how to
[162:57] convert
[162:59] currency string to currency sign like
[163:03] USD to the US dollar
[163:11] sign
[163:13] currency to sign
[163:29] Cy yeah I guess I'm going to have to use
[163:31] this
[163:35] Library
[163:37] nope it's probably your J object
[163:39] precomputed for these
[163:42] pairs I searched the stripe and reply
[163:46] and I couldn't find
[163:51] any so fun to Mak live on Twitter so
[163:58] cool okay yeah can see Twitter like
[164:01] stream is not very happy oh no now the
[164:03] quality is
[164:04] better the chat is
[164:06] gone
[164:14] okay
[164:17] G functions
[164:28] okay I think I'm going to be I'm going
[164:31] to end up using one of
[164:36] those European for actually it's going
[164:39] to be boring well otherwise you know
[164:41] what I think it really doesn't
[164:44] matter
[164:46] yeah I don't think it really
[164:49] matters I think I'm just going to
[164:51] display
[164:53] probably the
[164:54] currency in capital letters and we'll be
[164:57] happy with
[164:58] this invoice.
[165:09] currency class capitalize peer case I
[165:13] think it's called okay a little
[165:18] space and probably we need a
[165:21] stripe uh
[165:23] API
[165:25] amounts I think there are always two
[165:27] extra
[165:32] zeros
[165:35] balance
[165:38] cation oh actually no it's a
[165:41] thing Mak can me charge for the
[165:44] rec
[166:12] Fu in sense all right so I think it's
[166:16] safe to say we can divide this by 100
[166:20] and just in
[166:44] case
[166:46] oh
[166:47] wow right let me check that on YouTube
[166:50] what do we have here format new
[166:53] Intel
[166:57] currency oh wow okay let me try this
[167:02] out sick format new Intel format State

[170:52] invoice and boom we have all the
[170:54] invoices the
[170:56] customers ever created and Stripes
[171:01] somehow and we can click here download
[171:04] the
[171:08] invoice there we go
[171:11] $49 that's is it okay so this is working
[171:16] I'm self sending myself some
[171:20] compliments this is a good this is a
[171:22] good start I think it's getting late
[171:25] here um tomorrow I will be working on
[171:27] the editing part this is going to be
[171:30] this is going to take a little while
[171:32] because I need to recreate the invoice
[171:35] so basically I think I'll need to
[171:36] recreate this thing with
[171:40] HTML add an input form here so that
[171:44] customers can actually change those
[171:47] information and then add an export
[171:50] function something that will I think
[171:53] just probably like a canva that will
[171:56] extract or a PDF library that will
[171:58] extract this HTML to some
[172:02] file and we should be good to go and
[172:04] then yeah and then the next part will
[172:06] probably be adding
[172:10] a the next part will be
[172:13] adding
[172:16] a the pricing for this app I have no
[172:18] idea how much we're going to charge but
[172:20] there might be some onetime payment
[172:22] thing somewhere and finally we're going
[172:24] to work on the cop the entire branding
[172:27] like uh colors
[172:29] phones all things and the copyrighting
[172:33] for the websites and then we should be
[172:35] ready to launch I hope I hope we should
[172:38] be ready to launch by the end of the the
[172:40] week um probably for something like next
[172:43] Monday
[172:45] y could be fun all right I think it's
[172:48] pretty much it um I'm around the I'll
[172:50] stay around the chat for a few minutes
[172:51] finishing my uh tan so if you guys have
[172:54] any question any
[172:57] suggestions or if you just want to talk
[172:59] about life and uh and the purpose of
[173:13] life
[173:22] that's
[173:41] cool I don't think so I think you need
[173:44] you need to have an
[173:52] account yeah yeah Stripes worth with
[173:54] currencies yeah yeah you you'll need to
[173:56] have a bank account here but I'm I'm a
[173:59] I'm wearing the stripe t-shirt but I am
[174:01] definitely not a stripe employee or
[174:03] endorsed by striping anyway so you might
[174:05] want to double check
[174:06] that all right I think that's a wrap
[174:10] um I will come back tomorrow uh probably
[174:14] ear
[174:14] and and probably spend more time on it
[174:17] um I was a bit overwhelmed with starting
[174:18] the stream again today and also my
[174:21] neighbors doing some weird stuff in the
[174:23] garden so uh tomorrow we'll achieve a
[174:26] little bit more thank you everyone for
[174:28] tuning in and I wish you have a good day
[174:32] rest of the day evening or night
[174:33] whatever
