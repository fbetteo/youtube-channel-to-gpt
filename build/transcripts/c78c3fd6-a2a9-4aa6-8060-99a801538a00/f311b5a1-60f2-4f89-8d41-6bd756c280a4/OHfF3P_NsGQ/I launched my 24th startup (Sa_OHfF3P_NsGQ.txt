[00:00] all right we are 20 hours after the
[00:03] launch day and my software already got
[00:05] 1.6 th000 users registered I was also
[00:08] selected to be the product of the day
[00:09] and I got this little badge right here
[00:13] and the crazy part is that two weeks ago
[00:16] the idea didn't even exist so in this
[00:18] video I'm going to show you how I got a
[00:20] bunch of startups ID I'm also going to
[00:22] show you the product and the text tack
[00:24] that I use and some methods I use to
[00:26] build a product in around 7 days and
[00:28] some software Engineers will not like
[00:30] this part of the video and finally I'm
[00:31] going to cover the launch day and how I
[00:33] managed to get around 7,000 visitors on
[00:36] my lening page let's go how do you find
[00:39] startups ideas this is one of the most
[00:41] common question that I get asked on my
[00:43] channel and the answer is a little bit
[00:44] counterintuitive when I started the
[00:46] Journey about 6 years ago I was
[00:48] brainstorming startup ideas for hours
[00:50] like sometimes even days thinking I will
[00:52] come up with something magical and I
[00:54] implemented those IDs and none of them
[00:56] actually worked but about a year ago I
[00:58] started to stop thinking about ideas and
[01:00] instead I started to build stuff
[01:02] whatever it is and then I would stumble
[01:04] up across problems all the time like DNS
[01:08] issues or like knowledge uh issues or
[01:10] like I don't know where to launch my
[01:11] startups I don't know how to do this I
[01:13] don't know how to do that and then now
[01:14] my lease is filled with startups ideas
[01:17] for instance for the software I just
[01:18] launched here is how I got the idea I
[01:20] have built 24 products and seven of them
[01:22] are making money and I want to build
[01:23] better products for people so I as them
[01:26] what they want to use and for that I use
[01:27] a feedback management tool called Kenny
[01:30] it's a little feedback board where
[01:31] people can suggest features and upot
[01:33] them so I know which one to prioritize
[01:35] the problem with Kenny is that first
[01:37] it's made for a big company so it's very
[01:39] cluttered there's a bunch of features
[01:41] and is very complicated for soloers like
[01:43] me and the second problem with Kenny is
[01:45] that if you have more than one product
[01:46] it cost at least $99 per month which is
[01:49] an insane amount of money for a feedback
[01:51] tool and just like this I had this idea
[01:53] of building an alternative to Kenny that
[01:55] is much simpler for smaller markets the
[01:57] niche of solopreneurs so instead of
[01:59] looking for ideas I buil solutions to
[02:02] problems I experience and chances are
[02:04] I'm not unique so many other people
[02:06] might have the exact same problem as me
[02:08] and they might be in need of my product
[02:10] and when I launch it I saw that many
[02:11] other solopreneurs experience the exact
[02:13] same frustration with other feedback
[02:15] management tools and that's how I know I
[02:18] have a product that uh will be used by
[02:20] users so unless you have been working
[02:22] for a company for 10 years and you know
[02:24] that there's some uh pains in their
[02:26] workflow like they're slow for this or
[02:28] they struggle to hire people then you
[02:30] might be able to have a good startups
[02:32] idea born from that but if you're uh a
[02:35] guy just like me and you spend most of
[02:36] your time home and you just want to
[02:38] build apps chances are you don't really
[02:39] have a problem that can be solved with a
[02:41] digital product so the way to find good
[02:44] startups IDs is to actually to build
[02:46] something anything rebuild a habit
[02:48] tracker that you use make a not taking
[02:49] app a grocery app for you and your
[02:51] family build anything along the way
[02:53] you're going to stumble across problems
[02:55] whether it's not knowing how to
[02:57] implement this feature or struggling
[02:59] with DNS Rec course or maybe it's even a
[03:01] marketing issue and you don't know where
[03:02] to launch your startups and these
[03:03] problems will give you tons of startups
[03:05] ideas so the way to find good ideas is
[03:07] to think less and build more all right
[03:10] now let me show you the text tack I use
[03:12] and how I build a product in 7 days and
[03:14] let's start with a quick demo of the
[03:15] software okay so this is the demo of
[03:17] inso the little feedback management tool
[03:20] I created this is the landing page I
[03:21] like to make interactive demo on the
[03:23] left so the cards are clickable and this
[03:26] is the landing page here for the feature
[03:28] part I like to have some interactivity
[03:30] so it makes people want to discover more
[03:32] so if you hover with your mouse you'll
[03:34] see all the little thing moving here and
[03:36] there and that's pretty much it for the
[03:37] landing page uh once you are signed up
[03:39] as an admin you will see all the
[03:41] feedback boards right here so this is
[03:43] the one that I use for inso as an admin
[03:46] I can change a few stuff here so I can
[03:48] change the themes to match my brand I
[03:50] can also uh manage the feedback that are
[03:52] being given by users uh this one was
[03:54] canceled because I fixed it I can change
[03:56] say that I'm working on this one or I
[03:57] Shi that feature and then there is a
[04:00] public uh dashboard link where on the
[04:02] right side we have all the features
[04:04] suggested by users once they're logged
[04:05] in they can uh click to upot them they
[04:08] can also suggest any features they want
[04:10] right here and they can have a
[04:12] conversation on each uh feedback given
[04:15] if they uh want to add more things there
[04:18] so here is the text tack I use to build
[04:20] this software and this is the exact same
[04:22] text tack I use for all my 23 websites
[04:25] when I don't change my text tack I don't
[04:26] procrastinate and I can focus on
[04:28] shipping features and product it's a
[04:30] nextjs repo so the front end and as well
[04:32] as the back end I have the little API
[04:34] routes by nextjs everything is handled
[04:36] with next I also use tawin CSS instead
[04:39] of CSS as well as Daisy UI for the
[04:41] components so things like uh the buttons
[04:44] the inputs and the forms my database is
[04:46] mongodb I hear you coming super base
[04:48] developers I don't know why mongodb gets
[04:50] so much hate I absolutely love it I
[04:52] click a button deploy a cluster I have
[04:54] it little string I add it to my code and
[04:56] boom it's working and the cluster is
[04:58] hosted on mongodb Atlas to authenticate
[05:00] users whether it's uh admin users uh who
[05:03] log to their actual dashboard or it's
[05:05] just users who want to provide feedback
[05:07] I'm using NEX oath it's a very simple
[05:09] library that has a bunch of social
[05:11] authentification providers so uh Google
[05:14] Facebook and GitHub for instance and I
[05:17] also always add a login by email so like
[05:20] a magic links and for that I use mail
[05:22] gun to send those emails there are tons
[05:24] of developers who don't really like mail
[05:26] gun I really love it it's super simple
[05:28] to get started and they have pay as you
[05:30] go service so for $1 you'll get 1,000
[05:33] emails which I think is really fair it
[05:35] took me around 7 days to build the
[05:37] product and this is not very common
[05:38] especially for software Engineers is
[05:40] because I make lots of trade-off first I
[05:42] remove a bunch of features that are not
[05:44] uh essential so there is no way for
[05:46] people to delete their account to
[05:48] retrieve their password or stuff like
[05:49] that and my second trick is that I don't
[05:51] use a bunch of software engineer tools
[05:53] so there is no typescript I ship
[05:55] straight to production I don't use G
[05:57] branches I don't test my code I I make
[05:59] all these trade-offs so I can ship
[06:01] faster I come from a developer
[06:02] background so I used to do stuff very
[06:04] slowly very securely I spent years
[06:06] building apps that made zero to
[06:08] sometimes a couple hundred bucks but
[06:10] nothing crazy but after years getting
[06:11] almost no results I changed my entire
[06:13] mindset and I focus more on shipping
[06:16] fast and having a better copyrighting on
[06:17] my landing page and surprisingly at the
[06:19] same time my Revenue went from not being
[06:22] able to pay the bills to about 50 to
[06:24] 150k per month at the moment because
[06:26] entrepreneurship is about making small
[06:28] bets and you can see the pattern applies
[06:30] to most successful solo prur out there
[06:32] they start to ship one tiny feature of a
[06:35] product and sometimes nothing happens
[06:37] sometimes it takes off and go viral and
[06:39] then at this moment they double down on
[06:41] it and they grow a big company my advice
[06:43] is this try to show the smallest version
[06:45] of your product to the world as fast as
[06:47] you can that's how you gather genuine
[06:49] feedback and know if it's worth or not
[06:51] your time and now that we're talking
[06:53] about one of the most exciting part it's
[06:55] time for a little coffee I usually
[06:56] launch on every platform so product hunt
[06:59] RIT hiker news and Twitter at the same
[07:01] time and the goal is to create some kind
[07:03] of momentum and get as much traffic as I
[07:05] can in about one day but I made a little
[07:08] mistake I normally schedule all my post
[07:10] on Twitter to make sure they go right on
[07:12] time when the product hunt launch starts
[07:14] and one of my good friend was in budy
[07:16] for just a week so I really wanted to
[07:17] see him you might know him already it's
[07:19] tibo maker one of the most prolific
[07:21] Indie hicker out there he's built a
[07:23] Twitter tool that he grew to
[07:25] $600,000 in monthly recurring revenue
[07:28] and he sold it for $9 figures he's an
[07:30] absolutely Legend as he was here for
[07:32] just a week we were having a lunch at
[07:33] the same time as I was launching and
[07:35] during the lunch with tibo one of my
[07:37] close friend Nik called me and said the
[07:39] product hunt link on Twitter is wrong
[07:41] and I didn't know if my computer had
[07:43] nothing with me besides my phone so my
[07:44] friend chibo gave me his computer and
[07:46] together during the launch we fixed the
[07:48] launch all right enough of this here's
[07:49] the launch strategies all right first
[07:51] Twitter is the most important part of my
[07:53] strategy because this is where most of
[07:55] my potential users are and they're also
[07:57] very active on product ton so can help
[08:00] leverage the launch on that platform as
[08:02] well I usually try to make one funnyish
[08:05] video you'll tell me if it's fun or not
[08:07] um where I say that I'm launching the
[08:09] startups and I give the product hunt
[08:11] link so people can see the products
[08:14] through product hunt and hopefully they
[08:15] will leave an up vote when they see the
[08:17] product the reason I'm making these
[08:18] funny launch videos is because first
[08:20] they do well on X at the
[08:23] moment videos X doing well it's kind of
[08:26] weird the second part is because I love
[08:28] making those videos I'm having a good
[08:30] time and I hope people can see that and
[08:32] so my tweet is more likely to perform
[08:34] well now that I have close to 100,000
[08:36] followers on Twitter it's tempting to
[08:38] think that it's easy for me to launch
[08:41] and it's not easy it's just easyer I
[08:43] started to make those fun launch videos
[08:45] when I had a couple hundred followers on
[08:47] Twitter and back then my tweet would get
[08:49] as many views and many likes as my
[08:51] tweets right now even though I had
[08:53] barely any audience there so even though
[08:54] you don't have a big audience on Twitter
[08:56] right now you can still make a nice
[08:58] interesting tweet for for people to
[09:00] discover your product those fun launch
[09:01] videos were my style and I absolutely
[09:03] love it but you can also be just show
[09:05] behind the scene make a video show your
[09:06] computer screen explain why you build
[09:08] the products if you're a person who make
[09:10] and launch app your life is so cool that
[09:12] there are many things you can share on
[09:14] Twitter you just have to find the right
[09:15] format and find your own signature so as
[09:18] I said before most of the launch
[09:19] strategy relies on product hunt I
[09:21] already made a video on my channel last
[09:23] week to show you exactly how you can get
[09:25] traffic and how you can optimize your
[09:27] product hunt launch you can refer to
[09:29] that and finally I launched on hiker
[09:31] news and on Reddit those are two
[09:33] platform that if you get lucky the post
[09:35] can go viral and can give you a bunch of
[09:37] traffic uh unfortunately this time I was
[09:39] not one of the lucky ones but definitely
[09:41] worth considering all right now let's
[09:43] talk about numbers the product has been
[09:45] on the internet for about 2 days now and
[09:48] there are 7,000 people who visited the
[09:50] site from product hun Twitter Reddit and
[09:52] hiker news 1.5 th000 people sign up for
[09:55] the product which is really big and I
[09:57] also got some really positive feedback
[09:58] especially from Peter levels one of the
[10:00] most prolific Indie maker out there who
[10:02] said the product is amazing and he loves
[10:04] the Simplicity of it yay that makes me
[10:06] so proud I also got the badge the
[10:10] product hunt of the Day badge from
[10:11] product hunt which is a good nice social
[10:14] proof for my website and this is just
[10:15] the beginning I hope that some Media or
[10:17] newsleter will probably check the
[10:19] content of product hunt and I might get
[10:21] more traffic later financially wise I
[10:23] spent $0 and I also made 0 as you've
[10:26] seen there is no pricing on the product
[10:28] is 100% % free for now I'm going to
[10:30] leave it as it is for free and what I'm
[10:33] doing in the reason there is no pricing
[10:35] uh which is very unusual if you've been
[10:37] following me I always uh say that we
[10:38] should add a pay Woll on websites first
[10:40] this is a bit special because I'm not
[10:43] disrupting anything I'm just taking an
[10:45] existing product and I'm making a
[10:46] simpler version of it and I think it's
[10:49] not fair for now to start charging for a
[10:52] simplicity so what I'm trying to do is
[10:55] I'm putting the product in as many hands
[10:57] as I can for free and I see how sticky
[11:01] it is um I'm looking for power users I'm
[11:03] looking for people who will use the
[11:05] product for month and either love it or
[11:08] tell me that it's solving one of their
[11:10] pain and then from that I will be able
[11:12] to know if it's worth opening a paid
[11:14] plan on the product and building more uh
[11:17] features for those users so for now I'm
[11:19] collecting feedback and waiting to see
[11:21] for an opportunity all right that's it
[11:22] for this video if you want to see the
[11:23] other 23 products I made I'll share a
[11:26] link to that video somewhere around here
[11:27] and if you like this video consider
[11:29] subscribing to the channel that really
[11:30] means a lot all right until the next one
[11:32] I hope you just ship it
