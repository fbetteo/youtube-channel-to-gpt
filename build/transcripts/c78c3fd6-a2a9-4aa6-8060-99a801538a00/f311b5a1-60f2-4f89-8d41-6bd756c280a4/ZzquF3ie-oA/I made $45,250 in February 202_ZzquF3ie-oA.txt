[00:00] in February 2024 I launched one new
[00:02] startup and added two sources of revenue
[00:05] to my income in total I made
[00:08] $4,250 as a solo entrepreneur with zero
[00:11] employee in this video I'm going to
[00:13] break down everything that I did this
[00:14] month and also why my revenue is down
[00:16] from
[00:18] $57,000 in January 2024 and finally a
[00:21] new routine that I found that helped me
[00:22] produce a better and deeper quality uh
[00:25] work let's get started I spent most of
[00:27] February working on Zenvo my new startup
[00:30] it is a no code tool for stripe users to
[00:33] let their customers generate invoices
[00:36] themselves uh without having to pay for
[00:38] the stripe fee I got this startup ID
[00:41] when I realized uh I gave stripe
[00:45] $1,600 Us in 2023 to generate invoices
[00:49] for my own startups it was a bitter
[00:51] feeling uh the option was turned off by
[00:54] default but I just didn't realize I turn
[00:56] it on after that I decided to turn off
[00:58] the option and then my emails were
[01:00] flooded with customers asking for
[01:02] invoices uh mostly Europeans who need to
[01:04] have well structured invoices with vat
[01:07] and so I had a new startup ID born there
[01:10] was something painful and there was also
[01:13] a financial outcome it would actually
[01:15] save me money uh to build a startup so I
[01:17] built it and I wanted to do something
[01:19] different I built it live on YouTube uh
[01:22] with uh you guys who came and join the
[01:24] streaming it was really fun to connect
[01:26] and also it helped me be more productive
[01:29] so so I would have to show up every day
[01:32] and I cannot just go on Instagram and CH
[01:34] chill when I'm on YouTube so uh overall
[01:37] it was really fun to be doing this um
[01:40] although the entire setup um you know
[01:42] relying on uh Bell internet connection
[01:45] which sometimes drop off uh was a bit
[01:47] stressful but it was overall really fun
[01:49] experience that I'm probably going to do
[01:51] uh one more time this year I spent about
[01:53] 8 Days building that startup Live on
[01:56] YouTube and once it was done I launched
[01:58] it everywhere um I actually shared a
[02:00] video of that launch day uh in the
[02:03] channel in my live videos You'll see the
[02:05] day probably nine is the day we launched
[02:07] it I went on product hunt Twitter hicker
[02:10] news uh Reddit uh I made little videos
[02:12] for that and the product got somewhere
[02:15] around 4,000 visitors within the first
[02:18] 24 hours which also got the first
[02:20] customers to my surprise it got the
[02:22] attention of some people like gear Mo R
[02:25] the COO of versal a billion dooll
[02:27] company I think he enjoyed the little
[02:29] notification popup that I created this
[02:31] is absolutely crazy to me as I am just a
[02:34] little uh internet maker alone in my
[02:36] room and I get the attention of really
[02:38] famous people like this it was just
[02:39] mind-blowing also Peter levels uh of the
[02:42] most prolific Indie makers out there
[02:45] retweeted the launch um and that kind of
[02:48] made my day and added a bunch of
[02:50] visitors as well overall the launch was
[02:52] pretty successful it made $2,000 within
[02:55] the first week of launching and I have
[02:58] some promising signs that uh there is a
[03:00] potential for this startup because
[03:02] customers would email me that saying oh
[03:05] finally a solution for that so it feels
[03:07] like I'm relieving a pain for some
[03:08] people which is a promising ID for the
[03:11] future all right now let's talk about my
[03:12] product bringing the most revenue shiest
[03:15] shiest is a botle plate for programmers
[03:17] to ship startups faster it made
[03:20] $39,000 this month which is down from
[03:23] $49,000 back in January this year it
[03:26] went down maybe because uh it's been 6
[03:29] month that been running the product it
[03:30] has made almost
[03:32] $300,000 and it might be fair to say
[03:35] that it has reached the the EOS the tech
[03:38] ecosystem and there is some kind of
[03:40] Market saturation going on or uh maybe
[03:43] it's just me uh not spending enough time
[03:46] marketing it uh I'm not so sure about
[03:48] that but at this point it really doesn't
[03:49] matter because um I receive messages
[03:52] from people who are actually shipping
[03:54] startups and making money online thanks
[03:56] to ship Fest and that really fires me up
[03:58] I also added two new components to the
[04:00] boiler plate thanks to the launch of
[04:02] Zenvo uh there is now a new testimonial
[04:05] component as well as a with and without
[04:07] competent my four other startups had a
[04:10] steady Revenue this month bringing about
[04:13] $3,000 um I have no customer support
[04:16] whatsoever so this is some kind of true
[04:19] passive income if I may but this would
[04:21] not be possible if I didn't have an
[04:22] audience of 75,000 people on Twitter
[04:25] talking about Twitter I made $250 in
[04:28] February from the creators earning
[04:30] Revenue nothing crazy but I'm just happy
[04:33] to have this little income income stream
[04:35] and also added 5,000 new followers and
[04:38] if you just join discover my Twitter
[04:40] thank you and finally I added a new uh
[04:42] stream of income to my Revenue it is
[04:44] YouTube I just got U 5,000 subscribers
[04:48] on YouTube uh this is just mind-blowing
[04:50] I think my Twitter following helped a
[04:52] lot and my channel got monetized a few
[04:54] weeks back and I already made almost
[04:57] $50 uh which compared to Twitter Twitter
[04:59] is pretty nice and it's just so fun like
[05:02] it's a New Journey and I'm just so happy
[05:04] to keep going making those videos and
[05:06] this month I started to follow Brian
[05:08] Johnson's blueprint routine in order to
[05:09] improve my health and this was a mistake
[05:12] I bought a uh sleep tracker in order to
[05:15] calculate my sleep score by the end of
[05:17] the night and I realized that the Deeds
[05:19] got me really anxious because I was
[05:21] getting obsessed getting the perfect
[05:22] sleep score which ironically would keep
[05:24] me awake at night and make my sleep
[05:26] score worse so I ditched the ring I got
[05:30] back to my simple routine where I don't
[05:32] work past 6: p.m. my wife and I would go
[05:34] out of the house because that's where we
[05:35] work at night we would stretch play
[05:37] games uh read books whatever uh which is
[05:40] not work and my overall uh sleep would
[05:43] be really good actually in the past 5
[05:45] years or so I have put sleep as my
[05:47] number one priority without tracking the
[05:49] data it literally changed my life it
[05:52] made me much more motivated to work uh
[05:54] it improved my creativity made me um
[05:56] better at handling Stress and Anxiety
[05:58] this is by far what has impacted my life
[06:00] the most if you can take care of your
[06:02] sleep all right that's it for February
[06:04] for the month of March I expect pretty
[06:06] much all my Revenue to go down because I
[06:09] have a really big project that I want to
[06:12] focus on um I expect it to be about 3 to
[06:16] six month of work which is a little bit
[06:18] daunting uh I'm a little bit stressed
[06:20] about it but I think it is the right
[06:22] thing to do and so I'm going to go uh on
[06:25] holiday and disconnect a little bit from
[06:27] the internet and spend some times on
[06:29] that project um I will also document
[06:30] everything I can on YouTube so if you
[06:32] want to follow along uh you can
