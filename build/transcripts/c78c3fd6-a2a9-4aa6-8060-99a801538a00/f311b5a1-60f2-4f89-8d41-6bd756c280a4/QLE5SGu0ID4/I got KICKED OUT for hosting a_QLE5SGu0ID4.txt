[00:00] in my case the key for this was to try
[00:02] to live an unusual life
[00:04] Wow 2024 everything compounded this is
[00:08] so crazy I'm I'm extremely
[00:10] nervous
[00:11] [Music]
[00:14] mental and don't forget to put this
[00:16] freaking
[00:17] pay and I hope you had a good
[00:21] [Music]
[00:25] time Mark time to open the YouTube
[00:29] Silver
[00:30] we've been waiting for so long open
[00:33] it okay okay this so beautiful it's
[00:36] weird to receive package from YouTube we
[00:38] started YouTube like January this year
[00:42] than all right oh wow YouTube made a
[00:45] welcome
[00:46] letter what do it
[00:50] say do you remember your first
[00:52] subscriber your 100th or your thousands
[00:55] keep creating keep building oh wow they
[00:59] it feels like the YouTube see sent me a
[01:00] liter so keep creating keep building we
[01:04] can't wait to see what you'll do next
[01:06] and we're here to support you along the
[01:08] way and who knows when you reach your
[01:10] millionth subscriber you may just write
[01:12] to you and ask do you remember your
[01:14] 100,000
[01:15] subscriber
[01:18] wow that is it the silver it's super
[01:23] legit wait
[01:27] that's beautiful
[01:31] presented to Maru for passing 100,000
[01:36] subscribers yeah so
[01:40] how how do you feel I grew up with
[01:43] YouTube like my University my teacher
[01:45] everything is YouTube from copyrighting
[01:48] marketing just even coding like most of
[01:50] my coding skills come from YouTube like
[01:52] this has been a long for a while like I
[01:53] would watch Youtubers with this stuff in
[01:56] the background and you know you kind of
[01:58] Imagine like wow that must be such a
[02:00] cool life to have this in your
[02:01] background this guy must be crushing it
[02:03] and just seeing it in real like it's I'm
[02:05] one of them now that's is so crazy I'm
[02:08] just I don't know I'm also okay it's
[02:10] time bragging time but I'm also very
[02:12] proud of me of course you've been
[02:14] showing up every day i' been making a
[02:17] YouTube video once a week even though
[02:19] you work full time on your app yeah this
[02:22] man Honestly YouTube is one of the least
[02:25] unexpected events that happened this
[02:27] year because the entire Journey started
[02:29] from like close to zero followers in
[02:32] January and pass 100K 2 months ago or
[02:35] something less than 10 months from Z to
[02:37] 100K and knowing that this is not my
[02:39] full-time job like this is a habit every
[02:42] Saturday I would make a video and only
[02:44] on Saturday I would wake up in the
[02:45] morning I have to find an idea an
[02:47] interesting angle a thumbnail an intro
[02:50] and shoot the entire video and be done
[02:51] by the end of the day and I stick to
[02:53] that habit since January this year and
[02:55] this happened I didn't quit I didn't
[02:58] quit at the beginning nothing was
[02:59] happening to month month was nothing
[03:00] like I made 10 videos it was nothing any
[03:03] tips to make a video like that you like
[03:06] to make but also people like to watch
[03:09] that's an interesting one I think the I
[03:11] think I'm um I'm not the typical
[03:14] YouTuber because I'm not a content
[03:15] creator I I just try to leave A Life
[03:18] That's unusual and make content out of
[03:20] it so my life is the story I don't
[03:23] create a story my life is the story and
[03:24] we tried to package it in a YouTube
[03:26] videos that hopefully feels like a
[03:27] better story but the key I think the key
[03:29] for this in my case the key for this was
[03:32] to try to live an unusual life and for
[03:34] that that means building stuff that
[03:36] people normally don't build um I don't
[03:38] know like doing Health routine that
[03:40] people normally don't follow this is
[03:42] what is behind this YouTube button yeah
[03:45] try to leave something that fills you
[03:47] and that not everybody is living try to
[03:50] make something different and try to
[03:51] stick to it long enough so that becomes
[03:54] your identity and people will identify
[03:56] you as the guy who does this can you
[03:58] show me one more time
[04:04] squ then
[04:10] [Music]
[04:23] press if I drop him we get Legacy
[04:28] earlier foreign
[04:35] speee
[04:37] [Music]
[04:58] spee I'm on the train to go to the south
[05:01] of friends from Paris to visit some
[05:03] relatives so I'm taking some time to
[05:04] break down things that happened recently
[05:07] so okay first for the launch of data
[05:09] fast it's been now 30 days exactly and
[05:12] it made 300,000 in Revenue which is
[05:15] absolutely mind- glowing it's by far the
[05:17] best product I've ever built and now
[05:20] that some students start to finish the
[05:22] course they start to get results and
[05:23] build their own websites and some even
[05:25] get users and customers that really
[05:27] makes me so happy I am also breaking
[05:29] down everything I achieved in 2024 and
[05:32] as a comparison this is my salary since
[05:35] I got fired from my software engineer
[05:37] job so literally nothing happened for
[05:40] the first 2 years I was just barely
[05:42] surviving then something took off in
[05:44] 2023 and in 2024 everything compounded I
[05:48] had no idea I would create a baller
[05:50] plate I had no idea I would make a
[05:51] course I actually had no idea what would
[05:54] happen I just knew that if I stick to
[05:56] something maybe eventually something
[05:58] will happen and let me um um be
[06:00] financially independent so I've just
[06:02] planted a bunch of seed like from the
[06:05] moment I got fired I I I made all those
[06:09] like 25 plus websites and then
[06:12] eventually at some point some of those
[06:13] website took off and created a little
[06:15] story and compound it if we take a
[06:17] software like Indie page for instance
[06:20] which is a little Link in BIO tool um it
[06:22] started earlier back in 2022 he was he
[06:25] was making roughly like couple hundred a
[06:28] month and just because I posted on the
[06:31] internet people gave me feedback they
[06:33] wanted to see some features and I just
[06:35] listened to my users and I started to
[06:36] implement those features one of them
[06:38] they wanted to see is an SEO backlink
[06:40] and the revenue kept growing because of
[06:42] that feature it's a matter of
[06:44] consistency showing up it's a matter of
[06:46] not giving up and listening to users and
[06:48] staying in the game long enough until it
[06:50] happens to you there's a quote that says
[06:53] we overestimate what we can achieve in
[06:56] one day but we underestimate what we can
[06:58] achieve in one year and this could
[07:00] summarize exactly my journey I never
[07:02] believe I would be able to build so many
[07:04] startups but I've have been showing up
[07:05] every single day and eventually
[07:07] something happened if you believe in
[07:09] yourself and show up consistently this
[07:12] can be your journey too you can do
[07:15] [Music]
[07:28] it V
[07:30] [Music]
[07:35] I recently was asked which feature
[07:37] should I prioritize for my software and
[07:39] usually I put them into two buckets the
[07:41] product features and the growth features
[07:44] and I split my time 50% for each bucket
[07:47] for instance for this little uh piece of
[07:49] software that I built and for all of the
[07:52] product features I have one goal in mind
[07:54] is to reduce the churn I just go to my
[07:56] stripe dashboard and I look at the
[07:58] subscriber turn rate and my goal is to
[08:00] make it go as low as possible and when
[08:02] you mix reducing turn and building
[08:04] features you end up building features
[08:06] your users want and for that I have
[08:09] built in my software again a little um
[08:11] feedback board page where my users can
[08:14] submit whatever they want to see in the
[08:16] product they can also up vote what other
[08:18] people post and so as a business owner I
[08:21] know exactly what my users want then I
[08:24] just list all of them by priority and I
[08:26] build them into the product for instance
[08:29] the one I working on right now is to let
[08:31] people search their uh analytics for a
[08:34] custom date wrench the goal with the
[08:36] product features bucket is to make
[08:38] people love the product so much that
[08:40] they don't want to churn and then
[08:42] there's is the other bucket which I call
[08:43] the growth features bucket it's features
[08:46] that users normally don't request it's
[08:49] more like my creative brain wants to add
[08:52] something uh because I think it might be
[08:54] valuable for my users one of them for
[08:56] instance which I shipped recently is uh
[08:59] in the email report use my users get
[09:02] from data fast at the bottom there is a
[09:05] growth Insight which is like an AI that
[09:07] is trained on the data from my customers
[09:10] to help them understand some patterns
[09:12] and how to make more money from some
[09:14] specific marketing channels this is not
[09:17] something I can ask my users because
[09:18] this is something I can only guess from
[09:20] my mind and the goal with this kind of
[09:22] bucket is to try a new vertical for my
[09:25] product to try to um find something that
[09:28] makes the product so good because it has
[09:30] this specific feature that my users will
[09:33] want to spread the word about it that I
[09:35] can update the lending page copy and say
[09:38] that this product can also do that which
[09:40] is amazing um it has some sort of like a
[09:43] grow business growth or virality
[09:46] embedded into it and I just split my
[09:48] time 50% improving the actual product
[09:51] and 50% adding new features and this is
[09:54] how somehow on data fast I'm able to
[09:56] increase the number of active
[09:58] subscribers without losing much of them
[10:01] and I'm not 100% sure where this is
[10:03] going to go but that's the blueprint I
[10:05] trust to grow this software to a million
[10:08] doll in
[10:10] valuation finally this Sunday we're
[10:12] going to have some first meet up in
[10:15] Paris oh yes no this is this is two days
[10:19] right yes this is totally mad look 500
[10:23] likes okay
[10:25] BR this is so crazy we just thought it
[10:28] would be nice to meet people behind the
[10:30] camera who are into like making apps and
[10:32] building little startups on the internet
[10:34] and I make a random tweet with a form
[10:36] for to submit just you know if you want
[10:38] to meet us like we open meet up actually
[10:40] I feel it's a very unplanned un nothing
[10:45] we don't have a script we don't have a
[10:46] place it's like open Meetup in the
[10:48] middle of Paris and I just posted that
[10:50] the Tweet got 500 likes which is a lot
[10:52] and then the four 130 people wow 13
[10:57] people coming in the Jan l yeah we
[11:00] thought like just 10 to 20 people sign
[11:02] up then it would be amazing because we
[11:05] posted very in the last minute and it's
[11:08] out it's like 3° outside it might be
[11:11] raining it's outdoor there's no splend
[11:13] or whatever 130 people actually we we
[11:17] might do it again in Bali and New
[11:19] Zealand very soon and I think if we both
[11:22] like it we can create like a even
[11:26] schedule of places where you're going to
[11:28] go even we're going to organize and I
[11:30] still don't know exactly how to
[11:32] structure the event but at least we can
[11:33] you know organize them in advance people
[11:36] can register and eventually we get to
[11:38] meet someone across the world
[11:42] yeah why you're
[11:44] concerning no serly this is going to be
[11:47] a mess we are 200 participants for the
[11:49] Meetup are going to manage everyone I I
[11:52] rely on you you're the one me yes I am
[11:56] I'm developer you know like uh you know
[11:59] I you the social person here how can I
[12:01] speak to 200 people in open space I
[12:04] think we we really I think we clearly
[12:08] underestimate how big 200 people is and
[12:11] let's say only 50% of them come that's
[12:14] 100 people and Mark is super nervous
[12:18] it's his first time like a speaking from
[12:21] dness I'm I'm extremely nervous I'm
[12:23] extremely nervous well you got this it's
[12:26] going to be fine people love you and
[12:28] people all want
[12:29] hear the story I hope it's valuable for
[12:31] people who are coming I really hope so y
[12:33] see you
[12:37] there we can I think we will make like
[12:40] two to three minutesand I'm not radio
[12:42] programmer I have take the Cod fast
[12:44] course of Mark maybe one month ago this
[12:47] is why I was really jealous of you guys
[12:50] because uh you can just take your ideas
[12:52] and bringing to life computers and I
[12:54] cannot so that's why I take the course
[12:56] of Mark it was really help so maybe some
[13:01] testimonials life testimonials so
[13:03] because uh programming it's uh really
[13:06] complicated for people who don't have
[13:08] the code uh it's a really hard to
[13:11] understand the the full picture and the
[13:14] course really help me because uh it
[13:16] takes everything maybe on the surface
[13:19] and uh and help me have the big picture
[13:22] understand what is really uh building a
[13:25] product8
[13:27] years8 years oh okay 8
[13:32] years have
[13:36] problem uh the lesson is even if the app
[13:39] is a very very simple app you don't know
[13:42] what user is actually going to Value so
[13:44] just ship it
[13:46] sh uh it was inspired a lot by this
[13:48] community so thanks everybody who is
[13:50] doing this crazy [ __ ] uh it's um yeah
[13:53] it's a huge motivation thank you
[13:55] everything and don't forget to put this
[13:56] freaking payable
[13:59] I'm poine and I started to create SAS I
[14:02] think three years ago uh with many
[14:04] failures I created websites Etc but uh
[14:08] each time I started a project I just
[14:11] abandoned just start if you have an 0 so
[14:15] and uh by the way it's to uh stick with
[14:18] it uh share your journey because when
[14:21] you are sharing people are here to help
[14:23] you to give you advice if you do
[14:25] everything in the shadow nobody will
[14:27] know and of course you're ID will remain
[14:29] secret but uh if you don't want your ID
[14:32] to be secret if you want to earn money
[14:34] with it so just uh ship it don't
[14:37] overthink and uh talk a lot about your
[14:40] project because everybody can help how
[14:43] do you find a good idea okay so I think
[14:47] yes I tried many different topics like I
[14:50] tried to create a fun Instagram account
[14:53] I tried crypto I tried b2c and I think
[14:57] product that was failure wasn't a
[15:00] failure at the end because it teached me
[15:02] a lot when you think your idea is good
[15:04] when you have idea how to Market it try
[15:07] to do things but if it doesn't bring any
[15:09] traction just for at a certain moment
[15:12] just drops the idea I think we just had
[15:14] a meet up I just talked to Fabian and
[15:16] Carlos and they all say I mean not all
[15:19] but some people say they came they took
[15:21] a flight to come to this meet up that's
[15:23] crazy yeah it was it was just a tweet in
