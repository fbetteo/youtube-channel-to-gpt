[00:02] we live
[00:15] okay and are we live on Twitter as well
[00:19] I think we are here we
[00:22] go up and here we
[00:28] go welcome everyone welcome to the live
[00:31] uh Yep this is working okay uh hello
[00:34] this is Mark uh welcome to the YouTube
[00:37] live this is day four of building a
[00:39] software small software startup uh live
[00:41] on YouTube twitch and Twitter if you're
[00:43] on Twitter I added a link to the YouTube
[00:46] uh uh live the quality is better there
[00:48] so you you'll have uh more chance to see
[00:50] what I'm uh typing and coding um we are
[00:54] uh we we we're day four of uh building
[00:57] this little startup live so we already
[00:59] have a product that's working with a pig
[01:02] wall users can login and today we're
[01:05] going to focus on the landing page and
[01:07] make the copywriting which is one of the
[01:09] most important part and for that we have
[01:11] a very special guest which will uh I
[01:14] will introduce in a few minutes if
[01:16] you're coming from Twitter probably a
[01:17] lot of you already know him um if you
[01:20] have no clue who I am I am Mark Lou I am
[01:22] a solo prer and I live here in Bali I
[01:25] have uh no ambition to go big uh no
[01:28] unicorn no employee no VCS I just build
[01:31] my own tiny uh internet businesses uh as
[01:35] you can see here those are all the tiny
[01:37] things that I've made uh and now it's
[01:39] making about $55,000 a month I have zero
[01:41] employee and it's 19 90% profit and I am
[01:45] a stripe user um six of those uh sites
[01:48] that you can see here are making money
[01:50] and one of the most common customer
[01:52] requests that I get is can I get an
[01:54] invoice and can I update this invoice um
[01:57] and it's not a very funny task to do so
[02:01] I would always have to go to stripe
[02:02] download the invoice send it back to the
[02:04] customer and sometimes if the customer
[02:05] ask for like they say they didn't get
[02:08] the right name or they need to add their
[02:10] business detail like V or those kind of
[02:12] things to the invoice I would have to
[02:14] screenshot the PDF invoice update it on
[02:16] Photoshop and send it back to the
[02:17] customer which is uh very Dreadful and
[02:19] to be honest very boring so I'm making
[02:22] Zenvo um to fix that so uh this is the
[02:26] product that we've built live in the
[02:28] last 3 days uh uh this is a very simple
[02:31] app where uh once you're logged in you
[02:34] get a unique link and you connect your
[02:37] stripe accounts you can have one or 10
[02:39] or 20 stripe accounts it doesn't matter
[02:41] um I've already connected five of mine
[02:43] and this is live and what happens is
[02:46] when a customer asks for an invoice I
[02:48] will'll just send them my link and then
[02:50] they could type their own email inside
[02:53] and then they could search for their
[02:54] invoices and they will see all the
[02:56] payments they've made for any of my
[02:57] stripe businesses so you can see here
[02:59] this this customer pay two times for
[03:00] Indie page and um if they want the
[03:04] invoice they can just download it or
[03:06] they can also update it so uh J say
[03:09] Miguel can say that he doesn't leave in
[03:11] New York but instead he live in Los
[03:13] Angeles and then he clicks download the
[03:15] invoice and that person will have a
[03:18] beautiful invoice ready for
[03:19] accountability or uh whatever this is uh
[03:23] so this is working this was built live
[03:25] uh during one of those lives so
[03:26] yesterday and the two days before and
[03:28] today we are going to work on the
[03:29] landing page and for that we are going

[09:46] perfect all right brother uh well thanks
[09:49] for thanks for
[09:50] coming I know it's not inviting yeah
[09:53] it's not an easy thing to do so happy
[09:55] happy to have you here um you've been
[09:58] you've been doing marketing for uh I
[10:00] think what something like four years or
[10:02] something more um like I started
[10:07] entrepreneurship seven years ago and I
[10:09] started marketing like six years ago
[10:10] like I mean I started directly with
[10:12] marketing
[10:13] basically okay okay so you are a
[10:16] marketer that turned into a developer I
[10:18] know you you've been making ABS I think
[10:20] you have took notes that is at 3,000
[10:23] monthly recurring Revenue you sold make
[10:26] uh makeing no that is mine you sold logo
[10:29] uh your logo app AI last year for
[10:31] something like
[10:33] $60,000 yeah you have a good okay so you
[10:36] have a good mix for both so what we're
[10:37] going to be doing today uh uh for people
[10:40] who are joining um this is the app we
[10:42] are going to make the landing page about
[10:45] uh so this is just a simple invoice
[10:47] maker and um simple place for stripe
[10:50] account owner to uh search edit and
[10:53] download invoices for their own
[10:54] customers Nico is also a stripe user so
[10:57] he knows the pain of having to send
[10:59] those invoices to customers manually and
[11:02] we're going to uh start with the copy
[11:06] and for that we're not going to edit
[11:08] anything we're going to we're not going
[11:10] to code we're going to go in Google doc
[11:12] and we're going to uh do some uh
[11:14] copyrighting like pure
[11:17] copyrighting yeah I I think that's a a
[11:20] mistake lot of Indie do is like you know
[11:21] they see like a nice landing page and
[11:24] they're like oh I'm going to do that and
[11:25] just replace it with my copy and like it
[11:28] can Works uh like sometimes but you
[11:32] don't get the most out of it so usually
[11:35] I like to start my copy with Google Docs
[11:38] and I think my most performing copy is
[11:41] the one I made for maker that guide and
[11:43] I started from Google Docs directly so
[11:46] because you you you if you just use a
[11:50] template you are limiting yourself you
[11:51] like have to think inside a box like oh
[11:54] how does that thing fit in there you
[11:56] know and not how do I make my design fit
[11:59] the copy so always think copy first and
[12:02] design you know come later after that
[12:04] after you've done the the hard part okay
[12:06] so when you do landing pages for this
[12:08] one like makers uh ads. guide you would
[12:12] go on Google Drive on Google Docs and
[12:13] you will write just pure text
[12:16] first yeah yeah I can even uh I think I
[12:19] can find the draft so you can show it uh
[12:22] let me just search quickly but uh yeah I
[12:26] mean I always try to start with Google
[12:28] Docs
[12:29] okay should be here um going to add this
[12:33] we're going to say what is the product
[12:35] stripe in Self Serve
[12:40] invoices all right so we both have
[12:42] access to the Google Drive that's right
[12:44] here and I don't we have never done that
[12:48] before so it's a it's a new uh thing and
[12:50] I think we're going to try to write copy
[12:52] probably I bet Nico might have some like
[12:54] a structure of how he organizes copy so
[12:58] how to you know
[12:59] maybe before writing copy we'll even
[13:01] talk about customers and why they would
[13:03] even purchase these product and we're
[13:05] going to try to uh iterate all that and
[13:08] the goal is by the end of the stream we
[13:10] should have an entire copy that we uh
[13:13] that tomorrow I will pull in the landing
[13:15] page so I will make the tellwin CSS
[13:17] components and I will uh use the copy
[13:19] that we made today in order to have a
[13:21] proper landing
[13:24] page yeah I think so uh I think the
[13:29] first uh important thing to keep in mind
[13:32] is like what's the goal of the learning
[13:33] page and you know that's my sound stupid
[13:36] like obviously I want to get money and
[13:37] sales whatever but like be sure like are
[13:39] you going to want you know people to to
[13:42] sign up for the app or do you want
[13:44] people to purchase directly like you you
[13:47] have different options and based on you
[13:49] know your funnel and stuff like that
[13:51] like you might want to use one or the
[13:53] other so first what like what your main
[13:57] goal for this uh for this landing page
[13:59] is it to get people to try the app to
[14:01] get sign up to leave their email or to
[14:03] you know get The Upfront purchase like
[14:06] that's the very first thing like Define
[14:08] the goal of of your copy okay so maybe
[14:10] you can write this down the goal is very
[14:12] simple is to get sales and the pricing
[14:16] is for the it's going to be 99 I think
[14:19] but for the launch it's probably going
[14:20] to make it 49 or something like this and
[14:23] this is a pay W
[14:26] first login after
[14:30] okay so basically people go on the
[14:32] learning page then they read then they
[14:35] click the you know purchase whatever
[14:36] button and then they have to pay up
[14:39] front to access the app is that correct
[14:42] correct okay is that like a onetime
[14:45] purchase or subscription it is a onetime
[14:47] purchase and if you're watching the live
[14:49] stream uh it's available at zen. you can
[14:51] see the landing page is blank and now
[14:53] there is just a buy button when you
[14:55] click you have a checkout
[14:57] session
[14:59] okay okay
[15:01] and okay wait I'm not sure if that's
[15:04] intended but on the stream you have like
[15:06] the the technical like preview uh like
[15:11] what the window you see on the left side
[15:13] I don't know if it's intended or or not
[15:15] but yeah so so I can see you better
[15:17] otherwise I'm just facing uh I I have a
[15:19] feel like if I don't see you it's it's
[15:21] kind of weird maybe I'll give it more
[15:23] space Oh actually I don't need
[15:26] that oh wait I think I found a better
[15:29] way uh I'm probably going to do
[15:31] something like
[15:34] that okay yeah I'm going to do something
[15:36] like
[15:38] this okay and I think uh actually let's
[15:41] make the text a bit bigger because it's
[15:43] small to to read and here we can just
[15:46] use whatever I I just always use this
[15:49] one but uh yeah so okay we have a
[15:53] goal so get sales so basically get
[15:57] people
[16:02] right the purchases yeah yeah
[16:06] whatever um okay so then we have to
[16:11] Define like okay what the product is
[16:13] exactly like what the like the job of
[16:16] the product you know the benefits uh you
[16:18] know it's like very basic stuff every
[16:21] marketer say but that's I mean there is
[16:23] a reason it's just it help you get some
[16:26] clarity about like who you're to who
[16:29] you're going to Target and some like
[16:31] emotional lovers and stuff like that so
[16:33] I've been in the situation because I
[16:35] made like a you know like a similar mini
[16:38] app for myself not long ago just to get
[16:41] the invoice and I think so there are
[16:44] some Alternatives but uh you don't want
[16:47] you know people to have to sign up and
[16:49] stuff like that it's like ah it's a
[16:51] headache pay subscription for that I
[16:53] just want like a my customer to be able
[16:55] to just click one button they have an
[16:56] invoice and done no like you know I just
[16:59] I don't want to handle like bunch of
[17:01] complicated stuff and I think that's the
[17:04] main thing like the Simplicity of fuse
[17:06] is going to be the main leverage I would
[17:09] say it's just it just work it's easy
[17:11] it's simple you don't have to bother
[17:13] like you just click it works so I think
[17:15] that's the main the main goal so
[17:19] uh call it the angle I
[17:24] guess because obviously customer are
[17:26] going to be people who have like simple
[17:29] stuff they it's not going to be like big
[17:31] companies who you know have like tons of
[17:34] invoice and [ __ ] they probably have
[17:35] accountant for that so we just it's like
[17:38] Simplicity and Target I gu like people
[17:42] like us
[17:44] so
[17:46] preneurs that's you know usually it's
[17:48] like people from the European Union like
[17:50] the German who say like ah can he get
[17:52] their invoice so it's like people who
[17:57] yeah sell
[17:59] One Time products because stripe handle
[18:02] subscriptions automatically
[18:05] so one time products
[18:08] and I don't know if that's grammatically
[18:10] correct
[18:14] butes so that's that's a Target you
[18:18] think for subscriptions they don't we
[18:21] don't need to it's it doesn't make
[18:24] sense uh stri generate invoices for
[18:27] subscriptions so you don't need to to
[18:29] make them I think it it also makes it
[18:32] for uh onetime payments it's just that
[18:36] when people make a purchase they will
[18:37] get it right away and they'll get the
[18:39] the invoice from
[18:41] stripe but the problem is when they do
[18:43] their accountability later by the end of
[18:45] the month they forgot they got they made
[18:47] a purchase 20 days ago and they received
[18:49] that email with the invoice and so the
[18:52] first thing they would be in their mind
[18:53] is like oh I'm going to reach out to the
[18:56] support email to get that invoice
[19:00] um so that's right because I think there
[19:02] might be you know a few different uh
[19:05] problem that this source
[19:09] so
[19:16] tripe unless you enable it so there is
[19:18] an option to to get invoices for for St
[19:21] But first you have to pay for it and
[19:25] that can be like up to two bucks per
[19:27] transaction even if the customer don't
[19:29] need the invoice which is basically
[19:32] wasted money
[19:33] so
[19:35] uh let's start with that and then we add
[19:38] the other one so strike doesn't
[19:39] automatically
[19:43] provide so invoice for one purchase UNL
[19:48] enabled
[19:50] and and it doesn't work like you cannot
[19:52] get an invoice for a pass transaction
[19:57] so
[19:59] yeah yeah that's
[20:01] true once yeah once the invoice is made
[20:04] so
[20:05] yeah for past one time purchase
[20:11] uh
[20:19] okay
[20:22] um don't Genera inv voice
[20:25] okay uh so what were you mentioning
[20:27] because you said for you the main issue
[20:30] is that people forget or
[20:32] something so yeah that's kind of what
[20:34] you say here uh they they forgot they
[20:36] got the invoice sometimes by email and
[20:38] then later on by the end of the month
[20:40] when they have to do their
[20:41] accountability they reach out and they
[20:43] say like oh by the way can I get an
[20:44] invoice which they got but probably 20
[20:46] days ago so they forget
[20:48] it are you sure because strip and a
[20:51] receipt but not an invoice and that's
[20:54] very different because the receip is
[20:55] just say oh someone purchased that but
[20:57] the invoice you have the company
[20:59] information and stuff on it so I think
[21:01] that's for me that's the main issue I
[21:03] had like people were all like oh yeah I
[21:05] got um I received but I did not got a
[21:08] proper invoice like my accountant needs
[21:09] those information and the invoice blah
[21:11] blah
[21:12] blah okay okay okay so that's a good
[21:14] point you know
[21:17] what oh that's probably why I got so
[21:19] many emails okay
[21:21] okay yeah okay because if it was just
[21:24] that you can just say oh just look at
[21:26] you pass email and you will find but I
[21:28] think I think I think most people do
[21:31] that before contacting the the support
[21:33] okay okay
[21:35] um but I would actually I would put
[21:38] expensive differently um
[21:43] so okay and I think the last one is uh
[21:47] so there are lot of apps that exist if
[21:50] you to write something uh there are lots
[21:52] of apps who already exist but then you
[21:54] need to you know to sign up and stuff
[21:55] like that like it's just a [ __ ]
[21:57] headache
[21:58] um
[22:01] most existing apps are
[22:09] uh we just
[22:14] want or can
[22:23] just contact the support So for you the
[22:26] goal is to reduce the amount of customer
[22:29] support yeah and for people is to I mean
[22:32] they don't want to contact you they just
[22:33] want to get invoice
[22:36] easily um so that solv the problem for I
[22:40] think two people like customer and the
[22:42] customer of the
[22:43] customers
[22:46] um so yeah I
[22:48] think
[22:51] um I mean so actually normally you you
[22:54] define the problem before picking the
[22:55] angle just I was familiar with a product
[22:58] okay basically so what I normally do is
[23:01] just you write down all the problems the
[23:03] product solve you know maybe because you
[23:06] your product is one thing but it can do
[23:07] multiple things so for example for my
[23:09] main app to notes um you can use it for
[23:12] you know brainstorming you can use it
[23:14] for journaling like there are lots of
[23:16] use cases and the thing is So eventually
[23:19] on the long term you will pick like you
[23:22] will make one learning page per uh angle
[23:25] or per target audience but on the short
[23:27] term when you're just starting out it's
[23:29] just waste of time like just focus on
[23:33] you know making one single very good one
[23:36] but you need to focus on okay what's the
[23:37] most appealing angle like and you know
[23:40] if you for example if you read I don't
[23:41] know some comments or you talk to people
[23:43] and you see that most people like maybe
[23:46] 60 70% are interested by the like
[23:49] brainstorming option and not necessarily
[23:51] journaling then okay you need to focus
[23:54] on journaling on brainstorming sorry and
[23:57] not Journal
[23:59] so it's just about that Define all the
[24:01] problems and then you can just uh pick
[24:04] okay I'm going to focus on like you know
[24:06] this single problem this and that will
[24:09] be my main angle for the rest of the
[24:11] learning page so okay yeah that's how we
[24:14] would normally do it one tiny thing uh
[24:17] which I get a lot and this is the most
[24:19] annoying to handle is if customers
[24:21] forget to add their business details
[24:24] like their vat number all those kind of
[24:26] details probably
[24:28] most often they're Europeans they want
[24:31] to update their invoice and this is a
[24:32] very tricky thing to
[24:35] do yeah yeah yeah so I know like I know
[24:38] there are some regulations like in some
[24:40] countries you know you cannot edit in
[24:42] voice like it's absolute headache but
[24:44] again we are not targeting those people
[24:47] so I think we are just looking for
[24:50] people
[24:52] who uh who like want something easy they
[24:56] don't really care about all the big
[24:58] regulations they just want their invoice
[24:59] and you know
[25:00] pasta um so don't you think don't you
[25:04] think that would be
[25:05] working because currently what you can
[25:08] do is which you get your invoice you can
[25:10] just instead of having Nico and your
[25:12] email you could have Nico your business
[25:14] ID your business V8 and you can update
[25:17] it
[25:19] yourself what do you mean
[25:21] for
[25:23] for okay maybe maybe I'll I I'll I'll
[25:26] search I'll sh the most two common
[25:29] requests I get so can I get an
[25:33] invoice so that's I think what we
[25:35] highlight in the first part and can I
[25:37] update my evos
[25:42] details so the these are the most common
[25:45] questions that I I got all the time and
[25:47] I feel like this doesn't we don't I
[25:50] think this is already working uh you get
[25:52] you just get the invoice and instead of
[25:53] having the person name you can change it
[25:57] for the business bus name or you can add
[25:58] V
[26:00] details yeah but what I mean is that I
[26:03] know that in some countries they don't
[26:05] allow you to edit some invoice after
[26:07] they done or something I'm not sure but
[26:09] point is we are not targeting people who
[26:11] are you know okay I want like a like a
[26:13] very perfect square you know corporate
[26:15] level accounting or whatever it's just
[26:18] some people in the invoice I need to
[26:19] generate and Basta so that's a different
[26:22] Target from like you know big companies
[26:26] that have very specific requirement and
[26:28] regulations like so it's important to to
[26:31] keep that in mind we are talking to the
[26:33] solopreneur who really don't like don't
[26:36] have time for that he don't really care
[26:39] uh like because there are regulations
[26:43] but that not his main priority he just
[26:44] want to get invoice to customers so uh
[26:48] okay that's just something to keep in
[26:50] mind okay I keep I keep
[26:53] insisting because this is happening a
[26:55] lot with Shas is like
[26:58] sometimes I sell ship PL to uh probably
[27:01] some people are Freelancers so they have
[27:02] a little business inference for instance
[27:05] they're not big corporates so they don't
[27:07] care if the invoice is perfectly
[27:08] formatted but they still need to add
[27:10] their vat details to that invoice and so
[27:13] they're just a little number they want
[27:14] to add to their invoice and which now
[27:16] Zeno can make very easily and I think
[27:20] some other strip business owner can
[27:22] relate to that question so I think it
[27:24] would be it's I think it's kind of
[27:26] important to mention it in the problem
[27:27] in the current strip problem thing and
[27:29] because we're targeting solopreneurs
[27:31] we're going to make a copy for
[27:32] solopreneurs we don't care if a big
[27:34] corporate sign
[27:38] up yeah yeah uh like like yeah basically
[27:43] the point is we make something simple it
[27:45] doesn't have to be like regulation and
[27:48] stuff like as you said people add their
[27:50] invoice detail but Al it's important
[27:53] like if you ask them up front when
[27:55] people are checking out it's probably
[27:56] going to lower the conversion rate
[27:58] because some people will be like oh
[28:00] what's my V8 number I need to add it now
[28:03] I need to look for it and then they get
[28:04] Buzz or something so you probably even
[28:07] if it's like very little but you
[28:08] probably lose some sales if you add that
[28:11] immediately because it add more thing to
[28:13] the form and you want to keep things
[28:15] very simple people pay and everything
[28:17] else can go after you know all the
[28:19] details but the most important thing is
[28:21] they pay you get the money like that's
[28:22] the number one thing and you don't want
[28:24] to be distracted by like details uh like
[28:27] that
[28:28] I think
[28:29] that's oh I think what I mean yeah but
[28:32] maybe we're talking about two different
[28:34] topic actually um I'm talking about once
[28:36] you are a Zenvo customer so you've paid
[28:39] you set up your Zenvo uh unique
[28:42] link you will send it to your customers
[28:45] who will request invoices or request
[28:48] invoices
[28:49] update and so those customers will
[28:51] already have paid but they might have
[28:54] forget to add some details to the
[28:56] invoice
[28:58] but that's like that the I'm talking for
[29:00] like so we have customers who will pay
[29:03] for the invoice but they have their own
[29:05] customers yeah and they don't want their
[29:07] customer to put all their detail up
[29:09] front because it might reduce conversion
[29:11] rate yeah like it's just you know adding
[29:13] too much details on the form prepayment
[29:17] yeah so no I think we talk about the
[29:18] same thing I'm just talking about the
[29:20] customer of the customers basically okay
[29:23] okay was it okay okay uh but yeah okay
[29:28] let's so let's go back to the to the
[29:30] thing so the main goal of this first
[29:32] thing is you know you define like you
[29:35] get to just you write down what product
[29:38] solve you know like just target audience
[29:41] it's like not really brainstorming but
[29:43] trying to think about okay who is this
[29:45] for and you know this is like a this is
[29:49] like boring part of you know writing
[29:51] copy but I think that's essential
[29:54] otherwise people will you know you just
[29:55] write whatever go through your mind and
[29:57] it's not necessarily toward the perfect
[29:59] audience so yeah that's the first thing
[30:03] and so now uh we have the solution so
[30:07] this is basically what the invoice do
[30:10] and then is just like okay one click you
[30:13] know uh one click invoice no need for to
[30:17] manually send an email to your customer
[30:20] like it it reduce the support so
[30:22] basically we list the benefits like how
[30:25] how the app solve you know the all those
[30:29] problems
[30:32] okay do you want to type it
[30:35] in uh yeah okay I will do that check
[30:44] so how can you call it Define the
[30:47] solution I guess doesn't really
[30:53] matter yeah
[30:55] so let's see uh
[30:58] one
[31:00] invoice
[31:04] generation
[31:07] uh Ser
[31:10] up I need
[31:13] to support I would
[31:15] say uh I mean yeah that that's the main
[31:18] thing like it reduce support
[31:25] So support
[31:30] okay
[31:31] and I guess so I don't know if that
[31:35] happen to you but you know sometime
[31:36] people are like oh if I cannot get an
[31:38] invoice I would have to ask for a refund
[31:40] or something so that's something I I
[31:44] know some people ask me for like like
[31:46] yeah I I really need an invoice of the
[31:48] way I cannot PCH I have to ask for ref
[31:50] so
[31:51] [Music]
[31:53] um oh then you give me some ideas wait
[31:57] or
[31:58] whatever
[32:01] um and yeah I think I think those are
[32:03] the
[32:04] main the main areas
[32:07] break break Fork flow I know mean by
[32:11] break not really what do you mean in the
[32:14] sense that you there it's a kind of
[32:17] things you don't want to do right so
[32:20] you're in the mood you're you're
[32:22] producing good work and then suddenly
[32:23] you have to go to that strap account
[32:25] search for that customer there's
[32:29] a I know it breaks the workflow yeah
[32:31] yeah yeah okay yeah I see what you mean
[32:34] I would put it in the avoid refence area
[32:38] so like you know refund or like
[32:43] uh yeah I mean it's yeah yeah so not
[32:45] just refund but
[32:47] like
[32:49] uh how to
[32:51] say yeah okay never mind I yeah let's
[32:56] keep
[32:58] um as long as it's clear it's mainly I
[33:01] think people who are watching might not
[33:03] get like if the start reading like that
[33:04] but point is it doesn't have to be very
[33:07] clear when you write copy it just need
[33:08] to be clear for you unless you are doing
[33:10] it with other people okay um I'm um I'm
[33:15] the student here but maybe we can make a
[33:19] we can separate two things there are now
[33:22] we're defining the solution we get so
[33:24] one click Ser Self Serve invoice
[33:26] generation is somehow a feature and the
[33:29] goal is to reduce the support so I feel
[33:32] like there those are two categories like
[33:34] feature and what it provides on the
[33:37] customer yeah feature and benefits yeah
[33:40] so yeah um like basically I separate it
[33:44] like that but you can make a table or
[33:46] whatever it's just like basically
[33:49] benefit and how I do that so you know
[33:52] but I
[33:54] guess I guess uh then we can do like
[33:56] that
[33:57] because reducing support is a
[34:00] subcategory of breaking the workflow
[34:02] yeah like I mean it's pretty much the
[34:05] same thing so
[34:07] uh so yeah it is
[34:10] yeah
[34:14] okay
[34:16] so maybe this will be necessary
[34:20] paperwork
[34:25] that's so right maybe I'll try to
[34:28] reorganize this real
[34:34] quick kind of see this way oh you're
[34:36] adding colors is it what you did no
[34:39] you're uh no it's just a
[34:43] highlight okay but I actually sometimes
[34:45] do
[34:50] um okay wait
[34:52] uh wait I got confused in I have
[34:55] like open let me just close
[34:59] everything yeah
[35:03] um yeah so what so that the like upfront
[35:07] work and what I like to do uh as so you
[35:12] know you get those information either if
[35:15] you are a customer yourself like if
[35:17] you're targeting people like you or by
[35:19] talking to your customers and what I
[35:22] like to do is to divide things into
[35:24] three categories so that's like you know
[35:26] preparing for the copy but like you have
[35:28] things you know for sure so this is what
[35:30] like things that people told you you
[35:32] have things that you guessed and uh like
[35:36] things that you make a dediction and
[35:37] things that are just you know oh I think
[35:40] this is that that you don't have
[35:41] anything to back it up and this is like
[35:44] us when you do customer research which
[35:47] go like a bit before the copy but not
[35:50] that necessary here because uh we
[35:52] already know the target audience but
[35:55] yeah uh so this is just a I think if
[35:57] you're doing if you have to do customer
[35:59] research uh just remember to like make
[36:03] sure because you don't want to base your
[36:05] whole copy around something that you you
[36:07] guessed you need to be sure that this is
[36:09] an actual problem or or whatever okay
[36:12] this is where actually using your own
[36:14] prod product and experiencing your own
[36:16] problems really helps because you're
[36:20] very likely to make sure that the copy
[36:22] matches the need the problems the
[36:24] customer
[36:25] experience mhm yeah yeah yeah so cuz
[36:28] otherwise just like
[36:30] a guess or an educated guess and like
[36:34] you want to have like more than that
[36:37] ideally so
[36:39] um yeah I think I think that's a good
[36:43] good enough for now uh but actually let
[36:46] me check in the YouTube maybe if
[36:49] questions or anything about that
[36:51] maybe uh we do
[36:55] have yeah
[36:59] uh yeah Che what's your Spotify
[37:05] like now we can we can answer that later
[37:07] or not answer at all for
[37:10] now yeah I don't see question on the
[37:13] YouTube live but maybe on the twitch or
[37:14] something you you can see some I don't
[37:17] know I I'll I'll let you know I have the
[37:19] questions here I'll let you know if
[37:20] there is anything relevant to
[37:21] copyrighting I think now we can move on
[37:24] uh I think it would be nice if we can I
[37:26] think finish the copy within two hours
[37:28] do you think that's
[37:29] [Music]
[37:30] doable uh so not the final copy for sure
[37:33] but we have we can have a draft for like
[37:35] in two hours yeah easily but the like a
[37:38] real you know final copy take for me
[37:41] take me like few days to finalize
[37:43] everything to have everything on the
[37:44] actual landing page but for the Google
[37:47] dogs draft we can uh finish that yeah
[37:49] okay um so I think now we can um like
[37:54] Define the hero so for me the goal of
[37:57] the hero is just
[37:59] to give like to tell exactly why are
[38:01] people on this page so you know tell
[38:03] what the product does maybe you know so
[38:07] show some kind of demo or something and
[38:09] then the rest of the landing page is
[38:11] here to you know uh answer people
[38:14] objections and questions or whatever so
[38:18] there are lots of templates uh like you
[38:22] know Ida uh problem agitate solution
[38:25] whatever and
[38:27] like you don't have to stick to those
[38:30] they're good when you're sarting out
[38:32] when you you know you need to to have
[38:34] like a gide but you don't necessarily
[38:35] have to stick out but for me I found
[38:37] that a hero giving like as much
[38:39] information as possible but of course
[38:42] while still being
[38:43] short uh is what seems to work best but
[38:47] there are no one way of doing copy like
[38:50] that's you know a problem with an
[38:53] infinite amount of solutions so uh we
[38:56] can just
[38:57] let's start with that and then we will
[38:59] see from the rest so let's do a I like
[39:03] to just start with the hero so we need
[39:05] to have I usually like to have like a
[39:07] big headline a sub headline some kind of
[39:10] description a call to action and then a
[39:13] way to visualize to visually represent
[39:15] the product what you're selling so I
[39:20] think I have um if you want to show some
[39:22] example you can show the landing page of
[39:24] to notes and uh make a ads guide uh I
[39:28] think it's it do it pretty well so here
[39:30] you have you know it directly like
[39:32] immediately you can see turn miss it out
[39:34] inter actionable notes uh so it give you
[39:37] an idea already okay what this is about
[39:38] and then you have the number one AI
[39:40] voice note app uh I think the headline
[39:42] can definitely be improved but it give
[39:44] you like a good overview but the
[39:47] important thing here on the right side
[39:48] you have a live demo so I think no
[39:51] matter what you have like a quick demo
[39:52] like that just you know people can see
[39:55] how the product works immediately
[39:57] uh it's just better than you know they
[39:59] could read like like you know like a
[40:01] five minute video like they could watch
[40:03] a five minute video or read a lot of
[40:05] text but here they can just try the
[40:06] product themselves they can visualize
[40:08] themselves using it so I think that's uh
[40:12] probably what could work best in this
[40:14] case and I think on the maker ads guide
[40:17] I have just uh a picture showing the
[40:21] results so like uh I think it's like two
[40:24] 300 invested and yeah so yeah yeah so
[40:27] 250 invested and $1,000 of sales so it's
[40:32] it show basically the the
[40:34] benefit and so you want to
[40:37] really um make people visualize how the
[40:41] life could be with this product
[40:42] basically so in this case they can do
[40:45] that by trying the demo of the product
[40:47] they can see oh wow I could do that with
[40:48] the product Etc and in the other one is
[40:50] just oh wow this is what this person got
[40:52] as a result so maybe I can get that too
[40:56] so so for me that the important part of
[40:58] hero so people know immediately okay
[41:01] like is this planning page good for me
[41:03] or not like do I keep reading or do I
[41:05] leave the page so I think that's what we
[41:09] will try to make here so headline sub
[41:12] headline not mandatory but I like to
[41:15] have one and description and call to
[41:17] action so actually uh Che
[41:25] just okay
[41:34] so of the hero it's
[41:37] just um maybe filter out I don't know
[41:50] um um okay
[41:53] so we have the headline so I think what
[41:56] I like to do is
[41:58] just
[42:00] to
[42:02] okay so uh then basically I mean just
[42:06] write anything that come through your
[42:08] mind uh all the headlines IDs you can
[42:10] have so let's see uh the so the very
[42:14] first thing is we want to catch people
[42:16] attention because they're on the page so
[42:19] we somehow got their attention but it's
[42:21] still not done yet we want to make them
[42:23] clearly understand like
[42:26] I like is it you know uh is like why is
[42:29] this page good for you why is it going
[42:31] to interest you
[42:34] so uh yeah actually might beer like
[42:37] that um so let's see it could be
[42:41] something so it need to to be something
[42:43] they can relate to so I think in this
[42:45] case it could be something like I read
[42:49] of uh let me
[42:53] think so sometimes you want get the
[42:56] exact words you want so what I like to
[42:59] do is just to put brackets R
[43:03] of
[43:05] of that so you just capture you know the
[43:08] ID but not necessarily the shape sort of
[43:11] and you can come back to it later but
[43:13] the goal here is just to to brainstorm a
[43:16] bit um you can use Char GPT for that
[43:19] actually uh you can get you know decent
[43:23] idas but I think when you're starting
[43:25] out it's good to you know try to make
[43:28] the the muscle work because otherwise
[43:30] you will always be dependent on on Char
[43:32] PT so I would suggest try to get at
[43:35] least you know five to 10 headline ID of
[43:38] your own then try try GPT to see if you
[43:41] can find something
[43:43] better um so never send a stripe invoice
[43:48] ever
[43:49] um I feel this one is a bit weak
[43:53] because like
[43:56] people don't want not to S send a stripe
[43:59] invoice like it's not the problem but
[44:01] it's just like
[44:04] um like they need to like as you said it
[44:08] breaks the workflow and stuff like that
[44:09] but the immediate problem is not never
[44:11] St send a strip invoice like I don't
[44:14] like they want to to send a stripe
[44:16] invoice in this case so I'm not sure
[44:19] this would
[44:20] Works um but let's see what we can come
[44:23] up
[44:24] with and I mean may be a bit boring
[44:27] doing live stream because you have to
[44:29] think so there will be some some blanks
[44:31] but let's see there you go man I mean if
[44:33] you need to think go go ahead think I'm
[44:35] also try to think
[44:39] [Music]
[44:54] uh
[45:10] I think this one uh again this is not
[45:13] the final version of it but because it's
[45:15] way too long but the simple solution to
[45:18] invoice for your onetime purchase with
[45:19] stripe so simple uh like it directly
[45:25] right go into the like okay it's going
[45:26] to be you know something simple like no
[45:28] sign up whatever uh send invoice for
[45:31] your one time purchase so people who are
[45:35] have onetime purchased product can
[45:36] directly relate to that they're like oh
[45:38] okay this is like U you know this is for
[45:41] me I do that and we stripe so we are
[45:44] being you know specific and people are
[45:46] like okay this is I do one time purchase
[45:48] I do stripe so that's probably going to
[45:51] interest me but I think just having
[45:53] those two is not enough we need to have
[45:55] a bit more more of that but I think
[45:58] onetime purchase and stripe is going to
[46:01] be essential for the either the headline
[46:04] or the sub headline but we need to have
[46:06] a way to make people directly say okay
[46:09] this if you have that this is for you um
[46:12] I I like it man I think stripe is
[46:13] important I think the onetime purchase
[46:15] is not the most important here because
[46:18] then you filter out all the people who
[46:20] do subscriptions and I remember with
[46:22] habit Garden for instance I would still
[46:24] get people asking me for invit
[46:28] is but with
[46:30] um with stri normally they get it in
[46:33] their email like it automatically send
[46:36] it that's why I don't think that's the
[46:37] main
[46:38] target like maybe it's you know I don't
[46:40] know what like some people could be
[46:42] interested but I I really don't think
[46:44] that's the main target like with talk
[46:45] notes I don't think I've ever had anyone
[46:47] asking me for an invoice because Stripes
[46:50] send the email automatically after the
[46:51] purchase you don't have people asking
[46:54] you oh maybe you could still well
[46:59] okay I think subscriptions but I think
[47:02] it's also because I don't think toote is
[47:04] intended to it's something you purchase
[47:06] as a customer you never purchased this
[47:08] on their business for for ship they do
[47:11] actually I have lots of business for uh
[47:13] for to notes I have lots of business who
[47:15] use it but uh and they never ask you to
[47:18] edit their invoice they never say like
[47:20] hey can you uh you know I forget to add
[47:22] my business details that that's meant I
[47:24] got so many emails like this I forget to
[47:26] add my business details to the invoice
[47:28] yeah please add this to the invoice and
[47:30] send me back I get this so many times
[47:32] for ship
[47:33] fast H well I I don't know I never got
[47:36] any message about
[47:38] invoices using subscriptions and I know
[47:41] most of my customer are like uh Prof
[47:43] like half of them at least are Prof
[47:45] professionals but I mean we can okay
[47:48] maybe we can remove um one time purchase
[47:50] I guess um but let's make a variant so
[47:54] the yeah I think we could remove it
[47:57] because it's
[47:58] it's I mean both work the
[48:01] same
[48:04] so I would I would still so the other
[48:07] thing I would at this stage I would not
[48:09] remove anything unless it's like really
[48:12] bad or whatever but I would just try to
[48:14] add as much information as possible and
[48:16] then we will remove the worst one so to
[48:19] send invoices for your strike purchase
[48:22] um I'm not a big fan of purchase but
[48:27] transactions I don't know we can see
[48:28] that we can like right now we're just
[48:31] capturing the global ID to send um
[48:34] invoices for your stri
[48:36] transactions um so let's see what we
[48:40] [Music]
[48:45] have just want something
[48:50] simple uh so we can we can also talk
[48:53] about support somehow
[48:56] so let's see uh
[49:04] stop yeah that could Works maybe we can
[49:06] plug stripe somewhere after but I think
[49:10] yeah we can put a logo I think of stripe
[49:12] somewhere in the demo
[49:15] probably yeah yeah yeah so yeah
[49:22] um and I think so a great way to like
[49:25] represent that could be to have like a
[49:29] you know those notification popping up
[49:31] saying like oh where is my invoice can I
[49:33] get an invoice stuff like that I think I
[49:35] did that for one of my app oh man I love
[49:40] that oh man I absolutely love that I
[49:42] think I'm going
[49:43] to this is good I'm going to add
[49:45] notifications like this the hero
[49:47] sectionally that exactly this is can I
[49:50] get an invoice can you update my invoice
[49:52] please send me an
[49:54] invoice yeah this kind of stuff uh
[49:58] yeah uh I did that for one of my
[50:01] learning page back then and people were
[50:02] like oh wow that's actually you know fun
[50:04] and you can put some fun things like
[50:06] like if you get people's approval sort
[50:08] of they will like oh that's funny you
[50:09] know like they spend the time like they
[50:11] really are me like they they know what I
[50:13] need like because those are real message
[50:16] from real customer or something let me
[50:18] see if I can find them I think there is
[50:20] a business that does that uh I think
[50:23] it's something like with your mailbox
[50:25] where you reduce emails you receive or
[50:27] something mail
[50:31] blocker all sorry I'm disturbing you
[50:34] I'll let you move on with that I'm going
[50:35] to try to find that
[50:36] product no I was also looking for my all
[50:39] learning page but the JavaScript is not
[50:41] save I think uh but I think you can also
[50:43] try muzzle
[50:46] app actually that's where I got the
[50:48] original ID from and you will see on the
[50:51] top right you will have some yeah
[50:52] notifications popping up it's like old
[50:55] this
[50:56] like that should give the ID yeah so I
[50:58] think that's a great way to show
[50:59] visually the pain point you know like
[51:02] people will directly be like oh yeah I
[51:04] can feel that you know I got all those
[51:05] [ __ ] messages saying where's my
[51:07] invoice like the typical German guy ah
[51:10] can you get an invoice so I think lots
[51:12] of solo pronos can relate to that okay
[51:16] yeah I like I like that okay so this for
[51:19] sure we'll be there and so probably the
[51:21] angle we should we should go for the
[51:24] headline
[51:26] should be probably a positive one like
[51:29] not the first one or not the last one
[51:33] those two are kind of like negative like
[51:36] I don't know if you see what I mean the
[51:37] the other two are kind of like a
[51:39] solution like they're like hey you know
[51:40] you it's the simplest solution and you
[51:42] can relate because you've seen that
[51:44] notification oh actually no maybe
[51:47] not I would I would still not rely fully
[51:50] on the notification because yeah I don't
[51:52] know for some reason it might not show
[51:54] properly or whatever I would still keep
[51:56] the headline the main the main
[51:58] thing
[52:00] um but actually I like to I tend to
[52:04] avoid putting like negative headlines
[52:06] sort of I prefer
[52:08] to formulate it in uh you know in a
[52:12] positive
[52:13] way um yeah I think never pay again to
[52:16] send an invoice could Al work but I
[52:19] don't think that's the main issue like I
[52:21] honestly I wouldn't mind paying 20 cents
[52:23] per invoice when people ask me but it's
[52:25] just I don't want the headache of like
[52:27] you know any bleed for everything or
[52:29] something
[52:30] [Music]
[52:32] um I think this could this one could go
[52:35] in the description for sure uh but I
[52:37] think the headline should focus really
[52:39] on the main pain point which is here the
[52:41] like Simplicity or the headache of you
[52:44] know doing the customer support I think
[52:46] the cost is secondary
[52:48] probably yeah yeah
[52:51] um so I mean we can always come back to
[52:54] our headlin after so uh just move on um
[53:01] sub
[53:07] headlines
[53:11] oh
[53:13] uh
[53:15] okay because I want I want that in the
[53:24] description
[53:28] really what you want to catch people
[53:30] attention is something they can relate
[53:32] to so that's why you always need to be
[53:35] very
[53:37] specific uh in the headline like the
[53:39] more specific you can be the better it
[53:41] is uh but sometime it can also work
[53:44] against you because obviously the more
[53:46] specific you go the less amount of
[53:49] people will relate to the headline so
[53:51] you will lose some customers
[53:55] uh but you will convert other better so
[53:58] you need to find the right balance
[53:59] between you know precision and uh like
[54:02] rich or like volume I guess
[54:05] [Music]
[54:07] um so uh no why demo oh you read that so
[54:13] uh you can
[54:14] write
[54:22] red we have someone from twitch uh a
[54:25] super team who is actually working for
[54:27] an invoicing company you say there are
[54:29] so many points in invoicing
[54:32] Solutions yeah yeah I think it's like
[54:37] that's like that's why when you make a
[54:38] product like you have really lots of
[54:40] angles you can go with like maybe one
[54:42] product focus on you know having sure
[54:44] you have like a very perfect invoice
[54:47] that will fit the need of your German
[54:50] customers accountant perfectly maybe
[54:52] other focus on the simplicity so like
[54:55] maybe if a product is working and you
[54:57] know you can try to replicate it for
[55:00] another like angle sort of lots of way
[55:03] to go with that
[55:09] um yeah the product is focus on stripe
[55:12] transaction invoices yeah um I'll let
[55:15] you think Nico I'll show a quick demo
[55:16] for if people are joining now this is
[55:18] called Zeno yeah um this is a very
[55:23] simple app like this where as a stripe
[55:27] accounts owner I have those are my
[55:30] actual real stripe businesses those are
[55:32] live and customers ask for invoice or to
[55:35] update those invoices and what Zenvo
[55:37] does is you have a unink link that you
[55:39] can send to your customers and when they
[55:42] input their
[55:44] emails if I see some actual emails
[55:47] here then they can retrieve the invoice
[55:50] they've made with any of my strip
[55:53] accounts so in this case in the page for
[55:55] $45 and they can either download the
[55:57] invoice or edit it change their uh
[56:00] billing address billing details V and
[56:03] all that and then download the invoice
[56:13] again and just so there is a interesting
[56:16] comment so
[56:17] from Russian surf puppy so do you ever
[56:21] try to write multiple version of a copy
[56:23] and select what works uh yeah
[56:26] actually sometimes like it's good to
[56:28] write multiple copy just remake
[56:30] everything from scratch uh and like just
[56:35] try try and see if it CS better uh but
[56:39] usually that's how I start at least you
[56:40] know I just write my IDs like that uh
[56:43] but then after when you you know you
[56:46] launch like because you Al you don't
[56:48] want to be stuck for you know one month
[56:51] on the copy like just at some point you
[56:53] have to accept that you're going to
[56:55] cheap an un perfect copy but normally a
[56:57] good product should work even with a in
[56:59] perfect copy like as long as you have
[57:02] the minimum sort of uh so you can always
[57:05] you know come back to it change it later
[57:08] or remake it from scratch I actually did
[57:10] it for some product remake the whole
[57:11] copy from from zero again and that's
[57:14] fine um so yeah let's see for the
[57:20] description
[57:23] um you don't want to pay $2 to stripe
[57:26] your invoice uh I feel this is way this
[57:29] is like a too complex sentence there is
[57:34] negation toer I don't know not a big fan
[57:37] but let's see what we can have from that
[57:39] [Music]
[57:53] um
[58:13] invoice I think this one is a good
[58:15] thought tired of receiving 10 messages
[58:17] per day asking for an
[58:20] invoice
[58:23] uh
[58:25] but I think I really want to put
[58:27] somewhere like the oh [ __ ] I cannot I'm
[58:30] stuck like like what the [ __ ] is the
[58:32] solution because there is really I think
[58:34] for every person
[58:36] who go through that it's like there is
[58:38] this [ __ ] moment where you realize that
[58:41] uh stripe you actually you're stuck you
[58:43] cannot generate invoice from stripe like
[58:45] you have no solution other than doing
[58:47] the invoice manually so like
[58:50] the oh [ __ ]
[58:53] moment uh
[59:12] I think if we can speak to this specific
[59:16] event it will make the copy even more
[59:18] relatable and people would like oh yeah
[59:19] that's definitely a product for
[59:21] me
[59:23] um
[59:29] so let's
[59:33] see so we can also have like yeah some
[59:35] kind of relatable
[59:37] angle
[59:39] so you can although if you want to so if
[59:43] you take the example of
[59:46] uh maker as guide I think at some point
[59:50] I talk in the copy at the first person
[59:53] like oh I've been there I've done that I
[59:55] don't know I don't remember where but if
[59:57] you scroll down a
[59:59] bit uh bit
[60:03] more uh yeah here so that's also a
[60:07] possibility if you are part of your
[60:09] target audience you can directly use
[60:11] first person like oh I've been there
[60:13] I've done that this is why it's Su this
[60:15] is how you can do better that's
[60:16] something that can work if you are part
[60:18] of the target audience so people can be
[60:20] like oh wow this is like one of us so
[60:22] the product is definitely going to work
[60:23] for me
[60:26] um so here I think maybe we'll change it
[60:30] but the idea have is like we've all been
[60:45] there your ideal custom used the auto
[60:49] page is coming with their appr in their
[60:50] head why do I have to pay to the
[60:53] laar
[61:00] do you think about sending invoice out
[61:03] being
[61:07] done do you think about sending invoice
[61:09] automatically on a transaction being
[61:11] done on one of your product
[61:21] ah I guess I have to check the strip
[61:24] account
[61:35] um emails I
[61:53] think
[62:00] yeah that could be an interesting uh
[62:02] that could be an
[62:03] interesting part like sending invoices
[62:06] right upon a successful
[62:09] checkout no idea if that would work
[62:18] um what I did for makers I because I had
[62:21] the problem right after the purchase you
[62:24] arrive on a thank you page and you get
[62:26] like a you know like a thank you video
[62:29] this is how you can access the guide
[62:30] stuff like that but I also have like a
[62:31] big button that really stand out saying
[62:34] like generate an invoice and I think I
[62:37] didn't got any anyone asking me for
[62:40] invoice in then because it's directly sa
[62:43] it yeah so I think and you could yeah I
[62:47] think this would be I now now I I I I
[62:50] see how this work if you are building
[62:53] something you can create a customer
[62:55] portal
[62:56] like Stripe have a solution where I
[62:59] think it's actually
[63:01] here
[63:02] um there is a customer portal on stripe
[63:06] where uh yeah I didn't make a purchase
[63:08] with my account but normally you would
[63:09] have access to your customer ID the
[63:11] credit card you use the the actual
[63:15] invoice so I don't think this would be
[63:17] needed I think this is not like this is
[63:21] used for people who forgot they have an
[63:24] account and they paid like 20 days ago
[63:27] and then they're doing their
[63:27] accountability because they have the
[63:29] report every uh 15th of the month
[63:31] something like that and then the first
[63:34] thing that comes to their mind is not to
[63:35] log into their accounts but to reach out
[63:37] to the business owner like to the
[63:38] customer support to ask for an
[63:41] invoice instead of having to search
[63:43] through the user dashboard of course
[63:45] some do and that's why you know we don't
[63:47] receive like 100 emails per per week but
[63:50] some of them don't and they'll just ret
[63:51] to customer support and that's what I'm
[63:53] trying to solve with invoice and on the
[63:55] second stage this is more targeted but
[63:57] I'm trying to solve people who did not
[63:59] provide business details or messed up
[64:01] like they read their email with their
[64:04] business name and instead of typing
[64:05] their name they made a typo in it and
[64:08] they're like oh I want to edit my
[64:09] invoice this is more like a kind of like
[64:11] post purchase like later before uh doing
[64:14] your accountability thing solution that
[64:17] I'm trying to provide if that makes any
[64:23] sense
[64:25] I lost
[64:30] everyone and so just uh so I moved
[64:33] the what I was saying like we've all
[64:35] been there the moment you realiz you fog
[64:37] because stripe can gener invoices for p
[64:39] transaction and even if you could you
[64:41] need to enable it and they charge up to
[64:43] $2 for all transaction so I moved
[64:45] it at the bottom because I think it's a
[64:47] bit it might be too long for a
[64:51] description so we might use it in the
[64:53] body cop I don't know yet but I just put
[64:56] it aside and actually someone asked uh
[65:00] so do we find question do you find
[65:02] question helps or do they come across
[65:03] too aggressive and saly and actually
[65:05] questions are really good if you can use
[65:07] them because it like it open like a a
[65:12] loop sort of uh and people will want an
[65:15] answer so like uh you know
[65:18] like uh how to describe it I
[65:21] think open
[65:23] loop you can Wikipedia page I
[65:35] think yeah so basically people will want
[65:38] an answer so they are more like like if
[65:40] you put if you ask a question they will
[65:42] be more likely to read the rest because
[65:45] if you ask a question it's likely that
[65:46] you will give the answer like it's
[65:48] expected it's a marketing copy so it's
[65:51] just a good way it's really good way to
[65:52] catch people attention uh usually I use
[65:55] it in headlines when necessary like
[65:58] maybe for example uh I use like if you
[66:01] was selling something that reduce the
[66:04] cost uh I don't know of I don't know
[66:06] advertising or something you can say
[66:08] like oh are you wasting like a thousand
[66:11] of dollar per month in you know fees or
[66:15] whatever and uh then you like people who
[66:19] will match this like who actually spend
[66:21] thousand in on you know stripe fees or
[66:24] something they directly relate to that
[66:26] and they will want the answer to that so
[66:28] it's like oh yes it's me but you need to
[66:30] ask it in a way where people will be
[66:33] like either like oh yes that's me or
[66:35] maybe like did you know you could do do
[66:38] that and people be like oh no I didn't
[66:39] know I'm interested let's learn more
[66:41] about that I don't if that's clear
[66:46] enough
[66:48] um for the description bother do you
[66:51] think because your approach
[66:55] it looks like
[66:56] you what I usually do is I try to I gave
[67:00] people like some kind of like a promise
[67:02] of what they will get in the headline
[67:04] and then I explain how I'll give them
[67:06] this promise so I would say something
[67:08] like you know Zeno is the the simplest
[67:12] solution to uh send invoices and sell
[67:16] Ser invoices to your
[67:19] customers uh yeah I mean that can yeah
[67:21] that can work uh but I would I would try
[67:24] to be very more specific in the
[67:26] description like uh
[67:29] because like the
[67:32] description like people who reach this
[67:34] point are more interested so you can
[67:37] give a bit more details you know give
[67:39] you know just write a more lengthy copy
[67:42] so I would just I would add a bit more
[67:44] in there
[67:46] [Music]
[67:49] um but uh so you don't have to
[67:58] your customer
[68:01] fine uh I would even ask like
[68:05] generate because that like that there is
[68:08] nowhere where it say oh you can actually
[68:10] make the invoices so I would just make I
[68:14] would replace fine by generate it it
[68:17] doesn't or
[68:18] create okay
[68:20] okay
[68:22] like
[68:24] [Music]
[68:25] it will I will use so the way it works
[68:28] it will search for customers on their
[68:32] emails find those customers in stripe
[68:34] API and see if they have any invoices
[68:37] under their name so if they don't have
[68:38] invoice they will not get an invoice
[68:40] they will not get any
[68:42] results no but so that the thing stripe
[68:45] do do not generate an invoice
[68:48] like they need to generate it stripe
[68:51] will so what you do you look for
[68:52] transactions not invoices
[68:54] so that's why I think it's important
[68:56] because people if you if you write like
[68:59] find people will be like oh then this is
[69:01] for like uh only existing invoices you
[69:06] know what I
[69:07] mean it is it is I think that's where we
[69:10] have to uh be on the same page here CU
[69:13] and I think stripe makes an invoice all
[69:15] the time he might not send it but he
[69:17] makes an invoice all the time let me
[69:19] show you what I what I do on
[69:22] the uh retri invoice I mean unless you
[69:25] en if you enable the option for it yes
[69:27] they they will show an invoice
[69:31] but this is what I do strip account uh
[69:35] retrieve yeah I think you you retrieve
[69:38] the the ficients and then you find the
[69:40] matching transactions right I search the
[69:42] stripe
[69:44] invoices based on the customer ID which
[69:48] I got from the customer
[69:50] email but then the problem it's not
[69:52] going to work if you don't manually
[69:54] enables like basically if you have that
[69:57] you can just um click stripe send
[69:59] invoice button and it it should work
[70:01] because strip do not automatically
[70:03] generate the invoice it does I I
[70:06] tried I think I try with all products it
[70:09] does all the time it might not send the
[70:10] email to the customer but it does all
[70:12] the
[70:13] time actually okay uh is it is it live
[70:17] like can I try it for my own
[70:21] thing the yeah yeah sure
[70:25] you mean I will give it a try after
[70:26] Zenvo right yeah yeah Zenvo yeah yeah
[70:29] yeah it's it's working so for instance
[70:32] for
[70:33] uh whatever uh like I I try to plug all
[70:37] my products to it and then I can search
[70:40] any of my ship pass customers for
[70:41] instance and I would find their invoice
[70:43] so it's a onetime payment I haven't
[70:44] enabled
[70:46] anything but strip will create an
[70:48] invoice for any I think any payments
[70:50] that's made in the
[70:52] checkout so the point here uh you know
[70:55] there might be some more complex
[70:57] solution and some problem that I'm not
[70:58] aware of but I'm I'm trying to make this
[71:01] a very tiny product for now and trying
[71:03] to serve only my needs and hope that
[71:05] some other people will have it is that
[71:08] even though they would get an invoice
[71:09] either strip didn't send it to them I
[71:11] don't know and if it send it to them
[71:13] they received it like maybe 20 days ago
[71:15] and when they do their accountability
[71:16] they forget that they got an email and
[71:19] so their first reaction would be to send
[71:21] me an email and say like can I get an
[71:22] invoice
[71:24] and so they already have the invoice
[71:25] it's in stripe I would have to go in the
[71:28] customer section I would have to find
[71:31] the payment they made download the
[71:32] invoice and send it back and the worst
[71:34] part is when they ask me to edit that
[71:38] invoice um yeah okay I see but okay uh
[71:43] we'll have to verify that because I have
[71:45] doubts because I spend like one hour
[71:47] with a support asking them for an option
[71:50] to get the invoices but and they said me
[71:52] there is no option if you didn't enable
[71:54] it but um I think like yeah so then you
[71:58] need to like it's a different
[72:00] problematic then
[72:02] because for me personally my problem was
[72:05] um like I just don't have any option
[72:09] like there is no other option the
[72:10] invoice do not exist so I have to
[72:12] generate it manually to create manually
[72:14] an invoice and I think because I made a
[72:17] post on Twitter lots of people were
[72:18] saying oh yeah I have the same issue
[72:20] like blah blah blah so at least even if
[72:24] okay maybe there is an option that exist
[72:25] or whatever I think most people are not
[72:27] aware of it and if you say find invoice
[72:31] the word find imply that it already
[72:33] exists but if it doesn't matter if it
[72:35] exists or not people think it doesn't
[72:36] exist so yeah it's
[72:40] um I don't think like I think the word
[72:43] generate is more appropriate here but I
[72:46] might be wrong I mean that's depending
[72:49] on the target audience okay I think I
[72:52] mean in the case of Z
[72:53] voice it will be only to find invoices I
[72:56] will not be able to generate them if you
[72:58] don't have an invoice with stripe if
[72:59] you've never purchased with the business
[73:01] you will not get the invoice so to stay
[73:04] relevant with the products I will stay
[73:05] with
[73:07] find and then I will double check the
[73:10] stripe invoicing thing later and maybe
[73:12] we'll chat later like do some debugging
[73:14] and try to understand what is actually
[73:16] going on why do you uh the customers of
[73:18] yours don't get the invoice and mine do
[73:20] get the
[73:21] invoice but one thing for sure okay is
[73:24] that for my actual current stripe
[73:25] businesses they will create an invoice
[73:28] in stripe and I can find it with the API
[73:31] and so the IDE is really to find to let
[73:33] instead of like doing manually for
[73:34] customers and having to answer those
[73:35] emails have a Zen dispute like Zen voice
[73:38] sorry uh send one link and then
[73:40] customers Self Service to find their
[73:45] invoices so maybe you can make the copy
[73:47] for that and later on we can we can see
[73:50] you know if there is a another
[73:52] alternative to this product
[73:56] okay um okay
[73:59] yeah that on the
[74:02] side oh yeah um finally don't the STP
[74:07] invoice we don't have to um I would
[74:19] add it's just one minute setup reduce
[74:21] customer support so I think
[74:24] this basically shows everything maybe
[74:26] let your stripe
[74:30] customer that way we got really
[74:31] everything so we have stripe uh find
[74:35] edit download the May oh uh yeah there
[74:40] like that I think you want to get to
[74:43] show
[74:44] the relevancy as soon as possible but
[74:46] maybe but maybe I
[74:50] think I think let your customers that
[74:53] this sentence is quite hard already so
[74:56] maybe we can put it here and probably it
[74:58] will be in the
[74:59] headline
[75:01] so we'll have I I have a feeling we'll
[75:04] have stripe anyway show everywhere there
[75:06] will be the stripe logo and the demo
[75:08] there will be the stripe logo um is also
[75:10] probably going to be in the headline and
[75:11] maybe we focus because I think like this
[75:13] part is quite important
[75:17] here uh yeah but I like I don't think Z
[75:20] invoice is really relevant so um maybe
[75:23] you can just write let your customer
[75:24] find edit and download the stripe
[75:26] invoices so you can just remove this
[75:29] part um so you don't have to ruce
[75:31] customer so yeah let your customer find
[75:33] their invoices but then you can just
[75:35] remove Stripe from here uh but if you
[75:38] don't put it here or in the headline or
[75:40] something and I think even if it's here
[75:42] you need to add like some kind of fq
[75:44] because people will be like oh is it
[75:47] like only for stripe or does it also
[75:48] work for you know maybe like lemon
[75:50] squeezy or something so I think this
[75:52] important I would add it here I think
[75:54] that's going to be an objection so I'm
[75:55] going to add uh fq
[76:02] part oh wow okay you you you move
[76:05] forward
[76:08] here
[76:09] [Music]
[76:11] um okay
[76:15] so yeah then I think if we go with your
[76:18] option I think this one is the the best
[76:21] one uh so we don't have to Ru support
[76:23] customer support so it show like this is
[76:25] a benefit in just one minute so it's
[76:27] just like oh wow how fast like how fast
[76:30] is it uh you just need one minute
[76:34] setup
[76:35] so customer
[76:37] support with a one minute setup with
[76:40] just a one minute setup maybe something
[76:42] like that we'll see later um but yeah I
[76:45] think we can go with this one for
[76:49] now and let's
[76:52] see
[77:04] um then let's see
[77:21] uh think we can use
[77:23] that as headline too so if we don't end
[77:26] up using this one then that could also
[77:28] be good headline find edit and edit and
[77:31] download stripe invoice and just one
[77:32] click or generate or whatever but I
[77:35] think that could work
[77:37] too
[77:40] uh I think that's not really the point
[77:45] here I think what they what I want is
[77:48] like uh something that tells me like oh
[77:50] you know never take care of a stripe
[77:54] invoice yourself let your customer do
[77:59] it so maybe something like selfs serve
[78:02] like we can yeah because actually we
[78:04] never mention Self Serve anywhere so
[78:06] that could be a place for the sub
[78:08] headline actually like self serve the
[78:11] like the first Self Serve invoice
[78:14] solution or something like that maybe
[78:16] like I think adding s self the word self
[78:19] serve somewhere would show like oh this
[78:22] is like people do it on their own I
[78:23] don't have to manually you know like it
[78:25] it basically prove that oh you it
[78:28] doesn't take time so wouldn't that make
[78:30] sense in another part of the website
[78:32] because now we're trying to get
[78:35] attention so it's good it's a self
[78:38] solution but probably it's it's good you
[78:40] know we have a feature stuff that show
[78:41] that shows uh customers self serves
[78:44] their
[78:46] invoices so I wouldn't put it in the
[78:48] headline but that can go in the
[78:50] description like because like your um
[78:54] goal of the hero is not to catch people
[78:56] attention that the headline goal but
[78:57] then the the goal of the headline is to
[78:59] make people read the rest so you want to
[79:01] like you want to give him forward the
[79:03] product but I
[79:05] guess uh because what I I think we can
[79:09] do is M so mtion is somewhere maybe in
[79:11] the description and have like some kind
[79:14] of demo where people can oh try yourself
[79:16] and they can generate an invoice oh but
[79:18] yeah no it only work if they pay
[79:21] um H yeah then I guess a video I mean
[79:25] yeah that a video I think the video
[79:27] would do the work
[79:28] here
[79:30] mhm I think it's I think I think there's
[79:33] a for me at least that you the number
[79:37] one reason I build a product is like I
[79:39] don't want to take care of this myself
[79:40] so something that that sells
[79:43] me uh free time less support Less
[79:47] customer support like something you know
[79:49] that my day is busy I have a bunch of
[79:51] things to do I don't want to take care
[79:53] of this so it relieves a burden on my
[79:56] mind and that's what I want to see in
[79:58] the
[80:01] headline yeah I mean if you if you find
[80:03] like a short formulation for that but
[80:06] like you need to tie it
[80:08] to uh how to
[80:10] say uh not the product necessarily but
[80:14] it need to like fit the reading flow
[80:16] basically uh if you just because if you
[80:20] just throw something like oh save you
[80:22] know time doing customer support that
[80:25] that could fit for any product and like
[80:28] I'm sure like you know most people would
[80:31] love to have more time but people need
[80:33] to understand quickly this is what it
[80:35] does for you so maybe you can put it in
[80:36] the headline but then the Hub headline
[80:38] need to say something about the the
[80:40] product or something like you need to
[80:42] tie it in a way or another to the
[80:46] product Oh so it could be something
[80:51] like Ser invoices so you for your
[80:55] customers
[80:59] actually yeah
[81:04] um something like this and here I don't
[81:08] think I'm a big fan of this one I think
[81:10] the payment the fact that we pay I think
[81:12] is not really important this one
[81:15] is yeah you yeah you actually you WR it
[81:20] here yeah focus on your startup not the
[81:21] invoices
[81:24] uh yeah I guess that could Works focus
[81:27] on the startup not the
[81:31] invoices the
[81:39] name oh this is nice Focus your start
[81:41] invoices ship your startup in days not
[81:45] weeks yeah yeah I guess I mean that
[81:48] that's a good uh focus on this not this
[81:51] focus on your startup not this I I I
[81:53] think this kind of formulation can work
[81:55] for any product made to improve the
[81:58] productivity of Founders but I think
[82:01] this one can works but I would pick like
[82:06] managing strip invoices Ty of managing
[82:08] invoices or something because it's too
[82:11] too long but that could
[82:13] Works
[82:15] um
[82:19] um I think those three headlight
[82:25] yeah speak the most to
[82:27] me I'm not so not a big fan of stop
[82:30] wasting ours sending invoices because
[82:34] sending in the invoices take like one
[82:36] minute so but maybe managing invoices
[82:39] stop wasting hours managing invoices or
[82:42] something like that I don't know
[82:45] uh like but it need to be related to
[82:47] customers so I don't
[82:50] know I mean like a missing I think if
[82:54] this
[82:56] is this is clear now if if it's an
[82:58] invoice isely for the
[83:01] customers uh no because it could be your
[83:03] invoice that for example you make a
[83:05] purchase and you but with a stripe I
[83:08] think that can work because it imply
[83:09] that oh this is for like payment methods
[83:12] so I think this one in this state could
[83:14] works so actually I think we have three
[83:17] pretty good headlines yeah so sir inv to
[83:21] work
[83:23] them first now let's see for sub line so
[83:26] we want to add a bit more I like the
[83:29] like Sur invoice for customer so so
[83:33] put
[83:38] uhing striping
[83:42] [Music]
[83:48] voices
[83:50] yeah I this one SE serve invoices for
[83:53] your customers because you directly see
[83:55] what the product is okay so apologies in
[83:58] advance um if you hear some sounds that
[84:01] sounds like someone is having sex my
[84:03] wife is doing a workout and she's
[84:06] wearing earbuds she doesn't know she's
[84:07] making sounds just so we're clear
[84:17] here
[84:18] um maybe I put like a background music
[84:23] a little
[84:25] cafe cafe Loi
[84:27] Cafe yeahi
[84:30] Cafe um so I think yeah I think this is
[84:33] a good flow we start with one of those
[84:35] three then Ser invo for your customers
[84:38] and then we can add a bit more with the
[84:40] description so
[84:45] uh yeah actually I think I think this
[84:48] one is good so that doesn't mean that
[84:51] the final version but we all already get
[84:53] something to get started and we can
[84:55] always go back to that so now I think
[84:58] it's a good time to we use all
[85:00] creativity but let's use CH GPT to see
[85:04] if we can find some more um
[85:07] examples actually you can
[85:09] use
[85:11] um let me find the link because I made a
[85:14] char4 copy specifically uh let me just
[85:17] find
[85:20] it uh yeah copy
[85:24] GPT customers find edit and so you don't
[85:27] have
[85:31] to edit
[85:33] and rce customer support in just one
[85:36] minute okay I think we're pretty good
[85:38] here I mean um yeah it's it's upo but
[85:45] um do you think do you think we should
[85:48] cuz this is not perfect but you know we
[85:50] can slip on it and and see it again to
[85:52] tomorrow cuz if we want to do the
[85:56] problem agitation the feature
[85:59] stuff uh and finish before it's night
[86:01] time here in belly uh what what do you
[86:04] think yeah yeah true
[86:06] true uh yeah I think yeah I think we can
[86:08] just go with that for actually uh I will
[86:10] just throw the link to
[86:12] the um chat GPT in case you want to use
[86:16] it later or whatever
[86:18] um yeah copy gbt so I I trained it on
[86:22] like copyrighting material so oh let me
[86:25] send that to the chats I think if I can
[86:28] on
[86:29] OBS let's see what we get I think uh I I
[86:33] sent it to the okay to the YouTube
[86:39] chat I'll send it to Twitter
[86:43] then oh there's no
[86:46] someone yeah uh on Twitter there is
[86:49] right yeah
[86:51] true and actually just someone give a
[86:54] headline idea actually not bad give your
[86:56] clients one click access to invoice
[86:58] without paying extra 0.4 that would be a
[87:01] really good invoice uh good uh
[87:03] headline uh if we focus more on the like
[87:07] money angle um but I think that could
[87:10] like that could fit somewhere else but
[87:12] yeah um okay so here we have the hero
[87:18] and like so people at this point should
[87:21] know
[87:22] pretty much what the product is about
[87:25] but I think it would be interesting
[87:27] to to show an example so that's where a
[87:30] video like a quick demo video would be
[87:32] handy so either on the right side or at
[87:37] the bottom showing how easy it is like
[87:40] like you you do like
[87:41] a screen Studio demo or something like
[87:44] that
[87:45] [Music]
[87:48] um yeah I think that could do the trick
[87:52] you just thinking do you think people
[87:55] will uh play the do you think the video
[87:58] would work because there are two ways we
[88:00] these people will never watch a two
[88:02] minutes video at least not on the
[88:04] landing page on the hero section so do
[88:06] you think it's better to have like a
[88:08] 10-sec video where we can see a a
[88:10] customer like maybe oh okay no maybe
[88:13] that makes sense maybe like a
[88:14] notification pop up that says can I have
[88:15] an
[88:17] invoice and it sees the person typing
[88:19] back like oh just check out your find
[88:22] your invoice here it sends the link and
[88:24] the customer we can see the customer
[88:26] typing in the
[88:28] input okay okay that would make this
[88:31] perfect yeah I think I think I would uh
[88:33] I would do that like as a as a you know
[88:36] autoplay video like looping no sound
[88:38] whatever on the right side but like
[88:40] maybe like 30 second maximum or
[88:42] something like
[88:43] that and then you can add like Al more
[88:46] complex demo video like oh this is how
[88:49] it works you know like a like a one
[88:51] minute video something actually I would
[88:53] split test with and without the video
[88:54] because lots of people would be like
[88:56] watching the video and probably get
[88:58] distracted after so they would leave so
[89:01] I would test to see if the conversion
[89:03] rate change but yeah that could be a a
[89:05] demo video could work
[89:07] too just so uh we uh because uh the at
[89:12] least the way I do things is I like I I
[89:15] try to avoid split testing and testing
[89:18] stuff at the beginning cuz I have no
[89:20] clue if actually people will wants to
[89:22] use this product no confirmation no
[89:25] validation and so I feel like if you
[89:27] split something before you know if
[89:29] people are willing to try it it doesn't
[89:31] you would you could split test something
[89:33] like very different then you could split
[89:34] test startup e startup B but split test
[89:37] headlines split test videos when you
[89:39] have a a startup ID I feel I feel it
[89:43] doesn't make sense it makes sense when
[89:44] you have an established product like
[89:46] ship pass like um your Indie guides for
[89:49] maker your guides for maker for this
[89:52] so I think uh like at the beginning you
[89:57] anyway you won't have the traffic
[89:58] necessary to run a proper split test but
[90:00] I'm talking about the long term like
[90:02] this is something you want to try and
[90:04] because you there will be something you
[90:06] will not put on the copy right away but
[90:08] just keep it in mind for you know later
[90:10] maybe test it so uh I will
[90:14] like yeah if you pay yeah I think if you
[90:16] ask to pay up front I would make the
[90:18] demo video available right away so
[90:21] people can see
[90:22] or maybe depends two possibilities um
[90:27] you can have like a how it works thing
[90:30] with like some short video that play in
[90:31] autoplay like step one like link your
[90:34] stripe whatever then step two send the
[90:37] link to your customer step three
[90:38] whatever and that would replace a demo
[90:41] video uh or you get rid of that and you
[90:44] put a demo video instead of like you
[90:46] talking like hey this is how it works
[90:47] blah blah
[90:49] blah but I think I think to get started
[90:52] I would go with the how it
[90:54] works no video that way people can just
[90:58] uh so the um can you go on the talk
[91:00] notes landing page
[91:03] yeah if you scroll down I have like yeah
[91:06] this how it works so you can just show
[91:07] something like
[91:10] that to that's I think that
[91:14] makes but basically yeah you want to
[91:16] show like oh this is look this is how
[91:18] easy it is like literally with a 3
[91:21] seconds video you can see you know how
[91:22] it works yeah because I think if I make
[91:25] an entire video from people receiving
[91:29] emails to replying back with the link to
[91:32] customers
[91:33] finding their invoices and downloading
[91:36] them I think it's might be a bit tricky
[91:38] and I think as you say it's better to
[91:40] have how it works one two and
[91:43] three yeah and maybe eventually have at
[91:46] least for the
[91:47] yeah at least for the back end so like
[91:50] to explain like
[91:52] you know yeah basically like the more
[91:54] detail so I would I would still add like
[91:56] the video of someone typing like to to
[92:00] really show visually in the in the hero
[92:03] or maybe put the mobile notifications
[92:05] but then you have like a big empty space
[92:08] and then you have the how it works yeah
[92:10] I think the mle app landing page is
[92:13] quite nice like not like you know that's
[92:15] kind of like vertical landing page big
[92:18] headline sub headline description call
[92:20] to action and here here this is not a
[92:23] demo of the product but this is going to
[92:26] remember pain yeah and then after we
[92:28] could have a how it works now that I get
[92:31] your attention now that you know that
[92:32] this product is going to save you time
[92:34] and uh headaches on stripe invoices then
[92:37] you scroll and you have how it works
[92:39] create your link send it back to your
[92:41] customers s sery
[92:43] invoices yeah I mean I so I would um I
[92:48] would put something more before the how
[92:50] it works uh
[92:52] um maybe like you know like a a typical
[92:56] problem agitate
[92:58] solution um so actually if you um you
[93:03] can you can do that very easily and
[93:05] Visually by doing so what I did with uh
[93:08] I think you also did it with ship fast
[93:10] like you know doing this thing is like
[93:12] five hours doing that five hours and I
[93:15] also did it for maker side guide like
[93:17] with the guide without the guide and
[93:19] this is some kind of problem agitate
[93:21] solution like more like problem
[93:24] agitate like mine do problem agitate
[93:26] solution yours do only problem agitate
[93:30] um but I feel so you don't have to write
[93:32] a whole paragraph explaining like oh you
[93:35] know you're doing that like because I
[93:36] started actually uh with a big paragraph
[93:39] and I was like no [ __ ] it it's just too
[93:41] much text I'm going to make something
[93:42] visual but to start with I think it's
[93:45] okay for the draft to just write a big
[93:47] paragraph like this is a problem the
[93:49] solution and then after when you do the
[93:51] actual design you okay now how can I
[93:53] make this more visual you you shrink it
[93:55] down to something like that oh okay so I
[93:59] would add I would add like problem
[94:01] agitate solution then how it works and I
[94:06] mean the product is fairly simple so it
[94:07] doesn't really need much information so
[94:10] then I would just add like the price and
[94:12] then
[94:13] the
[94:14] um like yeah like fq or something like
[94:18] that I'm trying to think of some other
[94:20] objections but
[94:23] yeah so problem agitate solution and the
[94:26] second one would be the high
[94:29] works yeah which is kind of a solution
[94:33] uh it's like yeah it's so yeah it's
[94:36] pretty much solution you just show how
[94:38] easy it
[94:39] is um then I would add the price box and
[94:42] then the
[94:45] fq so this is somehow the
[94:48] features and then pricing
[94:52] in
[94:53] fq are we good with that so we have the
[94:55] hero section here at the
[94:58] top and then we have the problem agitate
[95:01] solution how it works pricing fq does
[95:03] that sound good to you yeah yeah I think
[95:06] that's pretty
[95:08] good um trying to think of think of
[95:12] something else
[95:14] but yeah I think that's uh I think
[95:17] that's pretty much it I mean like the
[95:19] point is not to make the whole Landing
[95:21] page right now is just to get a Ru draft
[95:24] and then we can iterate that um so yeah
[95:27] I think that's
[95:28] good and
[95:31] uh so for the problem Ed solution I
[95:35] think for now at least and you can okay
[95:39] you need to choose if you make like a
[95:41] with without or if you write some copy
[95:44] uh just keep in mind it's okay to write
[95:48] text people you know will read if it's
[95:50] interesting enough
[95:52] but don't put too many chunks of text
[95:54] next to each other so the problem I had
[95:57] with the first version of uh makers that
[96:00] guide is that everything was text which
[96:01] was like really boring block of text so
[96:03] then that's why I ended up making things
[96:05] more visual but I think in your
[96:08] case uh can either yeah I think it's
[96:12] okay to write but I feel for this
[96:16] product that would Al be a good
[96:17] opportunity for with without because you
[96:20] can make a clear comparison so that
[96:22] could be like with uh the invoice then
[96:26] it's like uh each invoice is free or
[96:29] something like invoice don't cost you
[96:32] 0.4% or
[96:33] 0.2 like free invoices you know you like
[96:37] that's something you can actually
[96:38] compare so I think that could work
[96:42] here
[96:45] um let me
[96:50] think I think so that's one of those
[96:53] case you could just make both
[97:00] so make one text version and
[97:03] one like table
[97:08] version
[97:11] okay let's
[97:18] see maybe like uh
[97:23] I'm trying to do a little research on
[97:24] stripe
[97:26] invoices to see uh you know if we're not
[97:29] missing
[97:50] something
[98:04] okay
[98:20] um
[98:40] custom permission to create a new
[98:50] voice
[98:56] discount custom
[99:20] information
[99:50] for
[100:18] he this right
[100:37] trying to think what else we can put
[100:45] here and so that's why the work like the
[100:50] thing we did at the beginning is
[100:52] essential because then you can go back
[100:54] to it like Define the problem so we have
[100:58] expensive doesn't generate invoice for
[101:01] invoices for past onetime
[101:03] purchase uh I need to update my invoice
[101:07] data so that something we can add
[101:19] here
[101:22] and yeah I think that's a pretty good
[101:23] comparison already we have like a good
[101:25] with and without and we could make a
[101:27] text version of that because you also
[101:29] don't want your landing page to be like
[101:31] a a carnival with like pictures and [ __ ]
[101:33] everywhere so you want some text like
[101:35] you want a good ratio with the good
[101:37] balance between text and like visual
[101:40] things uh but I think like you need to
[101:45] see how it looks like at the end when
[101:46] you make the actual copy but I think it
[101:48] should be fine uh just
[101:52] don't make it too
[101:54] like um I don't know too like not fun
[101:58] but like I don't know um just keep keep
[102:02] it simple yeah I think just keep it
[102:04] simple because then we have the how it
[102:06] works with the videos just under it so
[102:08] you don't want to have like a you know
[102:11] something popping
[102:12] everywhere um so just how it works what
[102:17] do you usually write for headlines above
[102:19] like this
[102:24] uh do you make a promise do you say
[102:28] something like the
[102:30] simplest so it's more to remind that
[102:32] this is for S SASS and softwares uh as a
[102:37] bit for SEO because I'm trying to rank
[102:38] for advertising for SAS so it's a mix of
[102:42] you know reminder like so people be like
[102:44] oh yeah okay this is really for me uh
[102:46] but also to try to you know get the some
[102:49] keywords for for but it's just just to
[102:52] bash you know to repeat people this is
[102:54] for software this is for software this
[102:55] is for software so we be like okay this
[102:57] is for software like they will really
[103:00] put it there uh but it's not necessary I
[103:03] would
[103:04] say
[103:07] um
[103:09] okay okay you're
[103:13] right and it's Al like cuz I think so
[103:16] there are lots of you know Facebook ads
[103:17] scores and stuff but the fact I
[103:19] mentioned the first because I don't
[103:21] think there is
[103:22] really at least as far as I know like
[103:25] guides specifically made for funer like
[103:28] India hackers who are looking to learn
[103:30] Facebook ads for software and SAS so I
[103:33] think the first one like it show oh this
[103:35] is like unique thing or whatever so Al
[103:38] to reinforce that a bit I don't remember
[103:40] exactly the logic but probably something
[103:42] like
[103:44] that
[103:45] [Music]
[103:49] um
[103:52] okay how it works I think
[103:55] uh for this one I think
[103:58] you yeah I mean you can have more maybe
[104:02] one two three four doesn't matter but I
[104:03] think for this one you
[104:05] more uh would be more relevant if you do
[104:08] it because you know the
[104:10] app and wait what
[104:12] so what I'm going what I like to do if I
[104:16] so if I include like videos or gifts or
[104:18] something that play automatically on the
[104:20] page what I like to do is just to have
[104:22] uh A visual representation so uh maybe
[104:25] you want something like
[104:29] that and here we can have like a
[104:32] video
[104:35] of yeah okay but you want to show in the
[104:38] video
[104:44] so that you have the headline and
[104:47] usually for that kind of video I don't
[104:49] like
[104:51] you can have like a layout with on the
[104:54] one side you have the video on the other
[104:55] side you have like the headline and some
[104:58] description uh
[105:03] just I think it's with I key right yes
[105:06] youra key
[105:18] and at your
[105:25] okay uh then so s you to your
[105:49] customer
[105:52] then what what can we have here
[106:05] uh no like no sign up or
[106:09] whatever sign up required like uh I
[106:12] don't know I don't really like this one
[106:14] but I would put something like that show
[106:17] like put emphasis on the Simplicity you
[106:20] you know like oh they just need to one
[106:23] click whatever they don't need to sign
[106:25] up you don't need to do some kind of you
[106:27] know like the portal [ __ ] where you have
[106:29] to manually sign them up like whatever I
[106:33] would just put the Simplicity here
[106:49] and
[106:53] made
[107:12] on just writing random like just to get
[107:15] the ages but uh can start service
[107:19] system
[107:29] oh what like us when I write copy I I
[107:32] like to focus first on the on the flow
[107:36] so that's why the sentence it doesn't
[107:38] like doesn't really matter yet uh what
[107:41] matter is where are you taking the
[107:43] customer
[107:44] mentally so you know like you're
[107:47] obviously not going to write that like
[107:48] this sentence really sucks bo uh but you
[107:52] know okay like I need to talk
[107:54] about like no need to do it yourself
[107:57] anymore customer can do it self service
[108:00] and no need to interrupt the work so you
[108:02] want to talk about like the all the
[108:04] benefits related to uh you know the like
[108:09] you don't have to do it the actual
[108:11] sentence you can change it later but you
[108:13] just need to keep in mind okay this is
[108:16] the kind of stuff I want to talk about
[108:18] that's where I'm bringing customers like
[108:19] mental speaking and you can already
[108:21] tweak the rest after so if you like
[108:25] think about it like the the flow is just
[108:28] like how the mental state of your
[108:31] customer so in here we just want to give
[108:34] information and make them sure that this
[108:35] is for them they should keep reading
[108:38] like okay this you you should keep
[108:39] reading after like the headline like to
[108:41] show this for you Etc this give a bit of
[108:45] details but we want them to you know
[108:47] keep reading keep reading keep reading
[108:48] until they are convinced enough that
[108:50] they can click a call to action and
[108:52] that's really what the copy should be
[108:54] all about is like make them keep reading
[108:56] give information and then you know
[108:58] answer any question they might have and
[109:01] actually if you like if you make a sales
[109:03] call with someone uh it's us like you
[109:05] should ask questions to understand okay
[109:07] are they you know understand the
[109:09] situation so this part you should do it
[109:12] before writing the copy this is when you
[109:14] do customer research and then you ask
[109:16] about your solution and then customer
[109:18] will have question and you go back and
[109:19] forth and it's some point they will be
[109:20] like okay I'm interested and then you
[109:22] sign them up so that's pretty much the
[109:24] same process except you don't do the
[109:26] customer research during the copy sort
[109:29] of it's done in advance so you already
[109:30] know the customer and um yeah so you
[109:35] will give information about the product
[109:37] then answer objections Etc and when you
[109:40] give information about the product it's
[109:42] it's not like oh look my product is the
[109:44] best our product has been working for 10
[109:47] years blah people don't care about that
[109:48] you can you can tie that to emotional
[109:51] things and you like when you sell you're
[109:53] selling you know emotional stuff so it's
[109:56] not about the product like because I
[109:58] said a lot you should give information
[109:59] about the product but you should both
[110:03] give information about the product but
[110:05] also like you know Tip Tap in the
[110:08] emotions like oh this is how it makes
[110:10] better and stuff like that like both are
[110:12] really together so you're not just
[110:13] selling the product you're selling like
[110:15] the you know the solution to the problem
[110:17] and the product is just like a sort of
[110:19] like vehicle to do that to justify the
[110:22] price like oh okay we have this solution
[110:24] in this package and that's going to cost
[110:26] you that much but really you just
[110:28] they're all interested in the solution
[110:30] so you need to give information about
[110:32] your solution so that imply yes showing
[110:35] some features but showing like the exact
[110:38] problem is solved Etc I don't know may I
[110:41] think that was a bit confusing but uh
[110:44] point is yeah you should keep like focus
[110:47] on making people read the rest until
[110:48] they have enough and okay no I want to
[110:50] buy and that's why you should also have
[110:52] like lots of cod to actions everywhere
[110:54] in your
[110:56] copy um yeah Mak sense man it's like
[110:59] don't talk about the product but talk
[111:00] about what it does for
[111:03] customers yeah it's like I mean you you
[111:06] can talk about the product but it's just
[111:08] a justification like we have this
[111:10] product this is how it works this is how
[111:11] it solves the problem basically it need
[111:13] to be like the emotion need to be tied
[111:15] to the product and vice
[111:18] versa um
[111:21] I mean yeah I think that's a pretty good
[111:22] Baseline copy then we have the pricing
[111:24] box you can just uh very important here
[111:27] to mention that's a onetime onetime
[111:31] purchase
[111:34] [Music]
[111:36] um
[111:39] so that yeah the pricing I think the
[111:42] pricing section I
[111:43] think let me know if I'm wrong but I
[111:45] think after the hero section the pricing
[111:48] section is the most important part of a
[111:50] landing
[111:52] page uh yeah because I think so lots of
[111:56] people will maybe just read hero and
[111:58] they will skip the rest uh they will go
[112:01] directly to the pricing because they're
[112:02] convinced or maybe they just don't want
[112:04] to read they will keep scrolling down so
[112:06] you need to give like a recap of what
[112:09] they get basically uh I think I mean I
[112:12] think ship fast does it well uh I think
[112:15] makers that guy do it well
[112:18] um I don't think if you go to Danny's
[112:21] website Hot Pro I think pretty much all
[112:25] websites like it is a real like hack as
[112:28] a user when I go onto a website of a
[112:31] product I've heard about the I read the
[112:34] headline and then the second thing I do
[112:36] is to search for the pricing page I
[112:37] click the pricing at the top it goes to
[112:39] the section and I know I will have a
[112:40] recap of all the features and usually
[112:42] that's the easiest way to get
[112:44] information about the
[112:46] product yeah so yeah actually I think
[112:50] maybe you can show it on the live like
[112:51] if you go to headshot
[112:53] Pro you will see the the thing uh maker
[112:57] gu like everything you get just the the
[113:00] recap yeah this is yeah so this this
[113:03] could actually be the almost the hero
[113:05] section it's so much clearer yeah so
[113:09] like you get the big headline
[113:10] professional head shot for 10 times less
[113:12] than a physical shot and that's the
[113:13] exact like almost the same uh headline
[113:16] that he's uh testing then another you
[113:20] know description and then the price what
[113:23] they get and the call to action and some
[113:25] social proof I think that's a very good
[113:27] one uh but ship fast one is also pretty
[113:30] good there she
[113:34] it where is that
[113:38] see yeah all you get in the B plates
[113:40] little
[113:44] headline so what can we do here uh I
[113:47] think we should Rec we could actually
[113:49] use one of those headline focus on your
[113:51] startup we do the stripe invoicing or
[113:53] something like
[113:54] this yeah that's actually so that's why
[113:57] even if you don't use all your headline
[113:59] you can just you know yeah put another
[114:01] one here like it's always handy to have
[114:04] like multiple headline um but I think we
[114:07] can here don't don't rent the wheel like
[114:09] the you know pricing Box model works
[114:11] well so we're just going to use that uh
[114:14] no wait so this is for the features so I
[114:16] think the headline oh
[114:18] okay
[114:20] uh
[114:23] [Music]
[114:24] yeah maybe like
[114:26] a quick you know recap here like some
[114:29] text
[114:30] whatever
[114:32] um and yeah basically what they
[114:41] get
[114:48] um
[114:51] I think here you want to remove
[114:52] objections about the like oh like what
[114:56] do I get like do I need to pay for each
[114:58] invoice or something so one time
[114:59] purchase no subscription pay once
[115:01] generate unlimited
[115:04] invoices so I think this remove the
[115:07] biggest objections like it's one time
[115:09] purchase and have unlimited invoices
[115:12] unimited
[115:16] accounts yeah and this R counts
[115:27] um I think we already have unlimited
[115:30] invoices here oh yes sorry oh yeah
[115:36] exactly
[115:38] um there is this uh I don't
[115:41] know this I don't know how to frame that
[115:44] but you know the fact that all your
[115:46] invoices in stripe become just one link
[115:49] and then you send your link back to
[115:50] customers you let them do their
[115:58] thing Ser serve
[116:00] link we can always come back to that
[116:03] later uh we know what we we know we want
[116:05] to put it here to talk about that but
[116:08] you know we can leave it as it is for
[116:09] now and come back to it later so I'm
[116:11] just putting brackets
[116:14] um uh yeah I guess oh so we have the F
[116:19] IQ
[116:22] wait yeah okay got here so here
[116:25] basically you usually you cannot really
[116:29] put too much question in fq so if you
[116:31] have a slight doubt will people consider
[116:34] that just add it and that way you're
[116:36] you're
[116:37] safe
[116:39] um oh someone asked would you separate
[116:42] the pricing page from the leing page uh
[116:45] so TR depends uh like if you have like a
[116:50] complex pricing page so I actually I
[116:52] would show an example um can you go
[116:55] to to
[116:58] notes and I think there is a a good
[117:01] example of that so I have like a pricing
[117:05] section it's like a really just basic
[117:08] thing but if you go to talkn not. i.
[117:11] pricing wait oh yeah uh can you edit the
[117:14] address and remove the hashtag yeah
[117:16] pricing then I have actually I have two
[117:18] plans but I only promote one in my uh
[117:21] thing because I know most people will
[117:22] take the chip plan and the problem plan
[117:26] is usually people ask me first and I
[117:28] give them the address so I know the
[117:29] majority only take the the cheap one so
[117:32] I only promote this one on the landing
[117:33] page so you can have both uh if like it
[117:37] really depends on your audience I know
[117:39] in my case most people have the plus one
[117:43] uh but you might you know you might
[117:45] that's something I would need to test
[117:47] actually but so far that work well well
[117:50] for me so I don't want to break you know
[117:52] what works but you can have both just uh
[117:57] make sure your landing page is simple
[117:58] you don't want to confuse people with
[118:00] price you know it's like credit system
[118:03] or some [ __ ] like that like it will be
[118:04] like like you just want like to make it
[118:07] as easy as possible to just click and
[118:10] get the answer
[118:12] basically yeah yeah
[118:14] yeah that's yeah headline price incorpor
[118:20] R year of access what you get yeah this
[118:23] is
[118:27] important okay so what do you think
[118:30] there by the way for a call to action
[118:34] button
[118:35] um I mean something really simple like
[118:39] get order today or get try today I I I
[118:43] I'm not a big fan of try try it people
[118:46] will expect to be able to try it
[118:48] immediately so I feel you might get lots
[118:51] of people who are like oh I expected to
[118:53] you know try it so get Z invoice I feel
[118:56] you should sell it as a software like oh
[118:58] this is a onetime purchase so get the
[119:00] invoice I think that would work get Z
[119:02] invoice today or order Z invoice you
[119:05] know something like that if you do free
[119:07] trials try it for free try today try the
[119:11] invoice like just adap the word to the
[119:14] what you're
[119:15] selling
[119:17] um so get
[119:21] invoice um are you going to run a offer
[119:25] for the pricing
[119:26] section yeah I think um I think overall
[119:32] the price will be 99 and I think for the
[119:34] launch I will I'll leave it at
[119:37] 49 mhm okay so like that's 50% discount
[119:41] uh more than no yeah 50% discount
[119:44] basically roughly I think lifetime exess
[119:48] as you said he
[119:50] want unlimited strip
[119:56] accounts yeah uh I think yeah then fq
[120:00] questions we don't have
[120:01] to unless you want to but I think we
[120:04] don't necessarily have to make the
[120:07] answer yeah we can do it like on the go
[120:09] yeah yeah yeah is is there any question
[120:11] that comes to your
[120:14] mind
[120:16] um does it work if I like
[120:19] let's see
[120:22] um maybe
[120:25] change does it work only for scribe to
[120:27] does it work for lemon squeezy or
[120:30] whatever like I don't I'm not sure that
[120:33] could be a thing and you can say no
[120:35] directly like but I think that's one
[120:38] major question people be like oh does it
[120:39] work for lemon sque or something so the
[120:41] wording need to make it clear that you
[120:43] have to use
[120:44] stripe um is it scker yes uh let's see
[120:50] um like does it work for one time
[120:57] purchase like if I if it was me back
[120:59] then I would be looking for like does it
[121:01] work if I don't have invoices already if
[121:06] I didn't
[121:07] enable uh invoices on
[121:11] stripe do you think it's this maybe it's
[121:13] the same question what would be the best
[121:15] way to phrase
[121:18] it
[121:19] what do you
[121:20] mean Drive
[121:24] invoice those two are kind of the same
[121:28] now uh no it's separate because like
[121:33] does it work for subscription like no I
[121:35] think it's it's separate okay and I
[121:37] would even add another one
[121:40] um does
[121:42] it
[121:44] f
[121:47] actions uh but yeah I don't really see
[121:49] anything
[121:51] uh I don't really see anything that
[121:53] coming to my mind right
[121:57] now
[122:02] transactions I think I think that I
[122:04] think that's probably something I will
[122:06] feel as I get uh customer questions yeah
[122:11] yeah yeah and I think something really
[122:13] important that your landing page is not
[122:15] you know static like you need to improve
[122:17] it like if you get feedback from your
[122:19] customers you need to tweak things like
[122:21] yeah it's just something that evolves
[122:23] over time and you can then make multiple
[122:25] learning Pages for each you know um type
[122:29] of users or stuff like
[122:33] that yep yep okay
[122:36] okay but I think that's a good draft
[122:39] honestly to get started I I just need to
[122:42] you know then like we have the copy then
[122:45] you can think about making the like a
[122:46] nice design around it but should
[122:48] wouldn't be that hard uh add some social
[122:51] proof lots of call to actions a bit more
[122:55] like visual stuff and I think that
[122:57] should be a good starting point yeah I
[123:00] think it is yeah get um yeah something
[123:02] that's important I think this uh you and
[123:05] then from makeer book who mentioned it
[123:07] add social proof if you can so if you
[123:10] have any friends who is who might be uh
[123:14] in use of the product give them the
[123:16] product for free do something that you
[123:19] have like real humans trying the product
[123:22] and you can add you know their feedback
[123:24] on your landing page that shows that
[123:26] some uh people are actually using it and
[123:28] benefiting from it I'm probably going to
[123:31] have to ask you a little testimonal Nico
[123:33] if that works out for
[123:36] you no problem that's something I wish I
[123:39] had two weeks ago yeah all right I think
[123:44] man I think
[123:45] we're I think that's a solid base for
[123:47] tomorrow
[123:49] yeah yeah yeah definitely I would still
[123:52] um you know run GPT to try to find some
[123:56] extra idas uh slep on it you will
[123:59] probably get more ideas tomorrow but at
[124:02] least that's a good start we got
[124:04] the the flow going like we start by
[124:07] showing people okay this is what it is
[124:09] about this is you know if you have this
[124:11] problem this is for you keep reading
[124:13] then you show like okay this is what's
[124:15] going to be your life with and without
[124:18] this product
[124:19] then this is you know how it works like
[124:21] the
[124:22] solution then this is how much is going
[124:24] to cost you and then you have extra
[124:25] objections or something yeah that can
[124:28] also uh works
[124:30] okay okay well maybe you can check if uh
[124:34] there's some people in the chat who are
[124:36] curious about marketing and I think
[124:37] maybe we can we can wrap up this little
[124:40] uh uh copywriting
[124:43] session mhm yeah yeah yeah
[124:47] yeah oh yeah there was a question by uh
[124:52] I don't know how you pronounce it uh
[124:54] Jose Jose well whatever but I remember
[124:58] reading recently LinkedIn someone
[125:00] suggested that uh something along the
[125:03] line start like something now versus get
[125:06] started now so it's always good to be
[125:09] more specific if you can but start
[125:12] sending invoice no kind of sucks so like
[125:16] start freeing up time don't really tie
[125:19] to the product so it's okay to just stay
[125:22] General if you can but if you have like
[125:25] a you know if you can make it very
[125:27] product specific yeah it's way
[125:30] better Jose okay J sorry for my uh
[125:35] accent well
[125:38] yeah
[125:42] um only see the YouTube questions so I
[125:45] don't know if there are other question
[125:47] yeah we get the little uh
[125:49] um troop of people coming from twitch
[125:52] but I think uh no serious question
[125:55] there and someone asking who will create
[125:58] the landing page uh that will be me
[126:01] tomorrow I'll use everything that Nico
[126:04] wrote today and add it to tell wi CSS
[126:07] components and have hopefully AIC page
[126:10] to show tomorrow and available for
[126:13] purchas I mean you also wrote nice stuff
[126:15] honestly like the yeah the the head and
[126:19] stuff that was some like pretty good
[126:21] ideas sikman that was fun having
[126:24] you yeah well I hope it was be if I hope
[126:28] it was useful and yeah I mean I guess uh
[126:33] that's pretty much it I mean if if
[126:36] anyone is into marketing I think it's uh
[126:39] it's a good uh recommendation to follow
[126:42] Nico on
[126:44] Twitter which is Nico
[126:46] J um sharing some good valuable tips in
[126:50] there and also building at the same time
[126:52] a startup called tootes which is I think
[126:55] at 3,000 monthly recurring Revenue right
[126:57] now and at the same time making
[127:00] it300 three okay that's an extra 10%
[127:03] 3.3k mrr and at the same time uh sharing
[127:07] your knowledge uh that you got from
[127:09] ads uh in this guide that you released
[127:12] recently uh this is actually this helped
[127:15] me uh set up my Facebook ads campaign
[127:19] uh which uh I think we are sitting at
[127:23] like something like a $51 per
[127:26] purchase uh seven purchase in the last
[127:29] seven days so that's one purchase per
[127:31] day which is exactly it because we spend
[127:34] uh 50 bucks per day and one purchase is
[127:36] worth $1.99 so that's a four time 4X
[127:40] return on investments so um yeah that's
[127:43] actually pretty good it it is pretty
[127:45] good yeah this is all thanks to you cuz
[127:46] you you've set up the entire Facebook
[127:48] ads for for me uh and so you made a
[127:51] guide here where you actually share what
[127:53] you learn as a marketer uh for Facebook
[127:55] ads and the same times you help other
[127:58] Indie makers like me and yourself with
[127:59] toote where you have your own software
[128:01] that you promote with Facebook ads and
[128:04] this is how you grew to 3.3k Mr so if
[128:07] you're uh here in the Stream uh
[128:09] definitely recommend checking out what
[128:10] Nico is
[128:13] doing yeah I mean Prett too much so it's
[128:16] uh I mean ads are pretty nice to grow
[128:18] but uh it's uh I like I wouldn't
[128:22] recommend to start uh directly with uh
[128:26] doing ads for this new little app
[128:29] probably do some uh validation first but
[128:31] I think that could be a fun thing to do
[128:32] after like a live stream like okay we
[128:35] have validation we try ads that could be
[128:37] something fun I hope I hope the product
[128:39] hits uh the market and we get there uh
[128:41] we're going to live stream everything
[128:44] that's pretty fun man I mean this is the
[128:45] first like I would never expect to have
[128:48] a guest
[128:49] I would never expect to live stream last
[128:50] year uh I did it and now like I'm having
[128:53] a guest like experts like you coming up
[128:55] to the show that's pretty fun it's
[128:56] pretty cool
[128:58] so uh yeah let's see what that goes man
[129:01] it's yeah yeah yeah but I think uh yeah
[129:04] we got pretty good consistent viewers
[129:06] like uh like toward the since the
[129:09] beginning but uh yeah I hope this was
[129:12] helpful and I mean just let me know if
[129:15] you need a I don't know more ideas or
[129:17] something and I think um put the uh you
[129:20] should give the link to the chat GPT
[129:23] like copy GPT I think a few people ask
[129:25] for it so maybe in the YouTube
[129:27] description and stuff like that could be
[129:29] useful so we can down yep uh do we still
[129:32] have it
[129:34] here oh [ __ ] I think I removed
[129:37] it oh uh okay I will I will send it to
[129:40] you on on WhatsApp and you can e after
[129:42] okay Budd uh I think I put it on my uh
[129:45] on my Twitter okay okay okay so the
[129:48] definitely check out Nico's Twitter he
[129:49] has made a GPT assistant or whatever GPT
[129:53] thing to help uh you know write copies
[129:56] Bas on your existing
[129:57] copy and I think we can wrap up for this
[130:00] uh I'm probably going to switch back to
[130:02] my typical stream uh solo stream thing
[130:05] uh to give a little bye-bye to uh people
[130:08] watching and um
[130:11] yeah all right well it was a pleasure
[130:14] see you another time thanks for joining
[130:16] man it was a pleasure to write the C
[130:18] with
[130:19] you yeah see R budy all right yeah
[130:27] yeah all right um and I think this will
[130:30] be the end of the stream for today it's
[130:32] a bit early but things went really well
[130:34] and a bit faster than I thought it would
[130:37] um so we have as a quick recap we've
[130:39] made this little startup thing um in the
[130:43] first day one day two day three on
[130:45] YouTube uh there um if you want to watch
[130:48] the recap uh on my YouTube channel
[130:50] you'll see all the videos uh there where
[130:52] we actually coded that thing the product
[130:55] the product went live yesterday um it's
[130:58] a simple stripe invoice uh generator to
[131:01] help business owners avoid doing
[131:04] invoicing thing as you can see here this
[131:06] is live for me I have connected some of
[131:08] my strap accounts and then I have a
[131:09] unique link here that I can say to my
[131:11] customers where they can retrieve their
[131:12] invoices edit them and download
[131:15] them um we have an empty Ling page for
[131:20] now as you can see here there's just a
[131:21] buy button Nico wrote a really nice copy
[131:25] today so we have a solid base for
[131:27] tomorrow I'm going to tune in and make
[131:29] the entire landing page uh so I'm going
[131:31] to go back to the text editor to the vs
[131:33] code editor and actually writes the
[131:36] entire copy um yeah I'll tune in in for
[131:39] a few minutes in the chat if you guys
[131:41] have any question and then tomorrow will
[131:44] be probably the last day of streaming
[131:45] until we are live
[131:55] would you recommend a demo on the
[131:56] landing page uh yes definitely a demo uh
[132:00] if
[132:01] possible try to do it for all my apps
[132:03] Nico who was here earlier has a demo of
[132:06] his um AI tool that summarizes your uh
[132:11] voice notes into actual notes uh you can
[132:14] press here and you can actually do the
[132:16] entire uh demo here
[132:18] and I try to um sometimes in my in the
[132:21] case of for instance ship pass one of my
[132:23] next CH boiler plate it's hard to show a
[132:26] demo so I have an image that Recaps
[132:28] exactly what the product is about what
[132:30] you get when you uh purchase so
[132:31] definitely recommend it to add a little
[132:33] demo somewhere above the fold on your
[132:35] Ling
[132:41] page will you promote it on ads and yeah
[132:44] I think Nico here mentioned that it's
[132:47] good to do ads once you have some kind
[132:49] of
[132:50] validation um if you start if you have a
[132:53] few you know customers already if you
[132:55] have a good landing page you can run ads
[132:57] and be profitable otherwise you can try
[133:00] I'm not U you know very good with that
[133:02] but you could try to run ads to validate
[133:04] a need uh but I think you would need to
[133:06] know what you're doing otherwise you
[133:08] might just end up earning some money how
[133:10] do you get your client
[133:12] acquisition how are you finding your
[133:14] clients to link them how sorry I mean re
[133:18] read this how do you get your client
[133:20] acquisition for instance how are you
[133:23] finding your clients to link
[133:25] them so I'm not sure but if the question
[133:28] is about how would I get customers for
[133:30] the tool um this would rely mostly oh
[133:34] probably because yeah um I build in
[133:37] public on Twitter so I have a little
[133:39] audience there and um those people are
[133:43] also like me using stripe so they might
[133:45] have the same problem as me I'm not sure
[133:47] yet but I have to test it so I build a
[133:48] product I'm going to share it with a
[133:50] couple of tweets and if uh you know
[133:54] people react to it it means that they
[133:55] might be something I'm also going to
[133:57] launch on product hand Hacker
[134:02] News um yeah taking a little bit time to
[134:06] load oh they changed the header yeah I'm
[134:08] going to launch on product hiker news
[134:09] reddits and see um if they are uh some
[134:13] people some demands
[134:16] there
[134:24] what inspired you to what inspired me to
[134:26] start streaming
[134:28] uh I think I
[134:30] so probably you guys know who Peter
[134:33] levels is um I love what he's doing I
[134:37] got really inspired by what it did and
[134:41] um this really changed my life like
[134:43] seeing his tweets and seeing his little
[134:46] projects uh and so I decided to do the
[134:49] the same but um taking it to a different
[134:52] um format uh he he he's been writing a
[134:56] lot on blogs before now he's I think
[134:58] he's doing most of his sharing most of
[135:00] the things he learned on Twitter I think
[135:02] there is some kind of uh connection um
[135:06] is quite friendly to have a YouTube live
[135:08] and so I'm yeah I'm giving YouTube a
[135:11] little uh little try and also uh this is
[135:14] uh you that might sound crazy but I'm a
[135:15] bit slower when I'm doing things on
[135:17] YouTube but on the flip side I feel like
[135:21] if I commit to a stream I have to show
[135:23] up and once I'm here I cannot just check
[135:25] my phone and you know go on Instagram so
[135:27] there is some kind of extra productivity
[135:29] that I get from being Live on
[135:35] YouTube what time will the stream be
[135:38] tomorrow and what time zone um so this
[135:41] is 3:00 p.m. my time here in Bali um I
[135:45] will show up tomorrow I guess around
[135:47] 10:00 a.m. 10 to 11:00 a.m. and I'll be
[135:49] streaming until the Ling page is done
[135:52] which uh will take a unknown amount of
[135:56] time I hope to be done by the end of the
[135:59] day um if you are on YouTube you can
[136:02] check the the replay of all the lives
[136:05] that I've done in case you you cannot be
[136:06] here uh during the
[136:09] livetime what Niko Facebook
[136:12] software use what ni Facebook software
[136:18] where you talking about you used to
