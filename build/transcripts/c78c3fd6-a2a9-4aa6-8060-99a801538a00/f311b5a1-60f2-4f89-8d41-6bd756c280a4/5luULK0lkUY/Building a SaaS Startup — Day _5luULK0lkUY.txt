[00:02] all right I think we are
[00:04] live let me know if you guys can see me
[00:06] hear me uh how's the quality is it good
[00:09] um if you're joining on
[00:11] Twitter uh I think it is live so yeah if
[00:14] you're joining on Twitter I'll drop a
[00:15] link to the YouTube video the broadcast
[00:17] quality is so much better um good
[00:19] morning everyone whatever you're from in
[00:22] the world it's midday 30 here in Bali
[00:25] and we are live for day seven of
[00:27] building a small software startup here
[00:29] live on Twitter twitch and YouTube um if
[00:33] you have no clue who I am my name is
[00:35] markl I've been building little startups
[00:37] on public in Twitter meaning that I
[00:39] share everything that I do learn and
[00:41] earn on my Twitter profile and I have
[00:44] currently 21 side projects uh some of
[00:46] them are making money and those who are
[00:49] making money generate customer support
[00:50] and one of the most common requests I
[00:52] get for customer support is can I have
[00:54] an invoice and can I edit my invoice so
[00:57] I am building Zenvo with which is a
[01:00] little no code tool for stripe you
[01:03] connect all your stripe accounts you get
[01:04] a unique link and you have selfs served
[01:07] invoices for your customers so if
[01:09] customer has to edit or generate or
[01:11] download an invoice you send the link um
[01:14] they do their little thing and they will
[01:16] get a private link where they can view
[01:17] all the invoices that they uh all the
[01:20] payments that they made with your
[01:21] business and they can uh do whatever
[01:23] they want with their invoice either
[01:24] download them or edit their business
[01:26] details um sometimes you know you make a
[01:29] typ point your name or you want to add
[01:31] your V8
[01:32] number this is available in zvo so the
[01:35] product is done we have been building
[01:37] this Live on YouTube um for the past
[01:41] week or so and today we are going to
[01:44] focus on the Ling page um let me double
[01:47] check making sure that we are actually
[01:49] properly live and I'm not talking in the
[01:51] void all right I think YouTube is
[01:53] working
[01:55] okay let me update the thumbnail as well
[02:01] that should be somewhere here okay and
[02:03] I'm going to share the link on Twitter
[02:05] if you guys are joining from there yep
[02:06] it's live on Twitter I will say uh
[02:09] better
[02:11] quality on
[02:14] YouTube and here we
[02:17] go okay um things are working well okay
[02:22] so let me know uh in the chat or
[02:26] something you know if uh everything is
[02:29] good you can see and hear properly make
[02:32] sure that sometimes my mic is doing
[02:34] crazy
[02:42] stuff all right I hope it is
[02:48] fine I have my little phone here so I
[02:51] can see
[02:53] messages
[02:57] and uh do whatever it's needed if uh the
[03:00] quality is not good so anyway uh we are
[03:02] back to it so we made uh we prepared the
[03:06] Ling page
[03:07] yesterday we just made the section above
[03:10] the fault we have a little header and we
[03:12] have this hero section this is not done
[03:15] I'm going to have to replace those
[03:16] images where real customers and I think
[03:18] the most important part is that
[03:20] notification thing at the top right
[03:22] where we try to agitate the problem that
[03:27] um TR business owners experience like me
[03:30] for instance where um you would get
[03:31] messages from customers asking for uh
[03:34] invoices and this is a bit annoying so
[03:37] uh this is what the promise of the
[03:39] startup does so uh spend time though
[03:41] here I think the main approach for the
[03:43] lending page um there's two benefits of
[03:45] using the product one is to save the
[03:48] stripe invoice fee for onetime payment
[03:50] is
[03:50] 0.4% on every Revenue so one is saving
[03:55] uh that fee and the other benefit is to
[03:59] actually save some time without having
[04:00] to generate those invoices manually for
[04:02] customers uh reduce customer support um
[04:06] you know like forget about invo
[04:07] basically forget about invoices and uh
[04:09] focus on your startup this is a product
[04:11] that's going to be mostly used by Indie
[04:14] makers so I think this headline makes
[04:17] sense um we have a
[04:20] clear not the best but at least a good
[04:22] message uh emotional message where you
[04:24] know like people want to be productive
[04:26] and efficient on their work so focus on
[04:28] your startup and not the stripe invoices
[04:31] I think there is a part missing here
[04:33] which is probably we want to highlight
[04:36] the fact that it's for stripe to build
[04:38] whatever trust or the people can
[04:41] actually relate right
[04:44] away so I probably going to try before I
[04:46] move on with the next sections I'm going
[04:48] to rewrite these later but I I'll I'll
[04:50] make first a draft an entire draft of
[04:52] the landing page I am think I'm going to
[04:54] try to see
[04:56] if I can add stripe logo here or maybe
[05:00] they will look weird I don't
[05:09] know we can try stpe
[05:13] logo I actually think I do have the
[05:15] stripe logo somewhere oh no
[05:21] nice stripe long and we are going to put
[05:23] it in Zenvo app and
[05:26] Bingo and here
[05:30] I have zoomed on my screen so you can
[05:32] see the code properly I hope please let
[05:35] me know if it is not uh clear
[05:39] enough so getting back to that thing
[05:42] here uh in the hero section I'm going to
[05:44] try to
[05:47] import board
[05:54] stripe
[05:58] image
[06:00] up and I think we call it strike
[06:04] long and
[06:06] here this might look absolutely horrible
[06:10] but I get to give it a try Source stri
[06:21] image he this is way too big in line
[06:25] with uh eight
[06:28] Maybe
[06:31] let's see there's trip
[06:38] invoices oh yeah I think the
[06:42] image yeah I think I'm going to run into
[06:52] a think we need to find a um a way to
[06:55] say this is for stripe we're using the
[06:57] stripe logo for inst brain
[07:00] [Music]
[07:02] recognition going to think where could I
[07:05] put
[07:09] this
[07:13] maybe
[07:22] alt say is maybe at the top of
[07:28] this
[07:31] create light I think would
[07:39] be this the most beautiful
[07:45] but little
[07:51] big probably going to have to rewrite
[07:54] all
[07:58] that
[08:14] up gener
[08:18] sh oh the chat okay chat is here yo Jack
[08:21] yo
[08:23] wev um focus and the startup generates
[08:26] stripe invoices
[08:28] automatically
[08:30] I like it it might be a bit
[08:41] long yeah that's a little
[08:45] bit Yeah the speed's a little bit too
[08:48] long make Shing no
[08:58] is
[09:02] let your customer generate and download
[09:04] their stripe invoices so you don't have
[09:05] to save stripe invoic 1 minute no code
[09:08] setup
[09:14] reduce I think I might stick with the
[09:16] logo right
[09:28] there
[09:33] make powered with
[09:52] trip
[09:53] [Music]
[09:58] Len
[10:36] um I think we can move on F now for the
[10:40] second section so if you are joining for
[10:42] this live for the first time you can
[10:44] check the replays of the previous live
[10:46] uh We've made I think it was last Friday
[10:48] or last Thursday a live with someone a
[10:51] partner uh a friend of mine actually
[10:53] called
[10:54] Nico um he's a really good
[10:57] marketer and he joined the live uh and
[11:01] we together we made the copyrighting for
[11:03] the landing page so I'm copy pasting
[11:05] what we've wrote before so the hero SE
[11:07] is done next we going to have a problem
[11:09] agitate solution or I think in our case
[11:12] we're going to say something like with
[11:14] and
[11:15] without and so I am going to gently copy
[11:18] what it did so he made a maker ads maker
[11:21] for what I say that a course an ads
[11:24] course Facebook ads course for Indie
[11:27] makers um in is actually um I've been
[11:31] working with Nico for uh the past couple
[11:33] month for one of my uh projects called
[11:36] CH fast and he has been running ads on
[11:39] my behalf on my Facebook ads account and
[11:41] this is actually a screenshot of mine uh
[11:43] he has been making um was that I
[11:48] think he's been running ads for like $60
[11:51] per day and it's making about $200 of
[11:54] out outputs outcomes so definitely
[11:57] recommend checking out his guide it is
[11:58] is really
[11:59] good um and we are going to copy this
[12:02] little component here so a headline and
[12:06] two
[12:07] boxes how does it look on yeah
[12:12] okay think we are going to go back here
[12:15] and say
[12:17] section
[12:20] class well actually maybe I should build
[12:22] a components that will be
[12:26] clear copy paste this
[12:29] and we are going ah actually I'm stupid
[12:32] I'm using a Bott plate of mine
[12:34] which already has a problem component
[12:37] give me a
[12:48] second I do have a problem agitation
[12:57] components we're going to call it
[13:04] here so this is a component that comes
[13:07] from with the B plate we are going to
[13:09] reuse that
[13:14] one in our case we want a before
[13:20] after so probably what we're going to
[13:22] say in the
[13:27] problem
[13:30] Tri
[13:35] invoices without the
[13:41] fee let's see maybe that could be a good
[13:57] one
[14:14] that
[14:19] generates
[14:24] invoices
[14:27] automatically
[14:30] um compliance
[14:32] does is it does this word here
[14:38] compliance not sure how it's spelled in
[14:40] English
[14:41] compliance
[14:43] compliance generate compliant invoices
[14:46] is it important we say
[14:52] this all right maybe I'll I'll get back
[14:55] to it later generate invoices
[14:56] automatically and here we are going to
[15:01] have going to remove that instead we're
[15:03] going to have two Dives last
[15:06] BG whatever text whatever adding
[15:12] eight and leaving
[15:16] relaxed duplicate that here we're going
[15:19] to have a BG red 200 I
[15:25] think and
[15:26] here green oh no maybe not what did he
[15:41] use all right maybe we'll make our own
[15:44] colors because we have a white
[15:45] background big
[15:47] green in
[15:50] here a little bit too
[15:53] much probably not enough anyway text
[15:57] um
[16:06] green 500 okay so here we're going to go
[16:08] back to the copy
[16:11] and we are going to copy that
[16:17] say waste
[16:20] time jpt is is actually go pilot is
[16:23] good I mean not really good but he knows
[16:27] what we're doing here
[16:29] without
[16:31] Zeno and with
[16:36] Zeno uh least
[16:41] of the
[16:46] TS okay okay okay
[16:57] okay
[17:05] I think this should be text left yeah
[17:08] we're going to why is the text at the
[17:10] center where did I put that yet
[17:16] here think we going to do this right
[17:24] there
[17:27] wa is supposed to be at the center what
[17:29] is going on
[17:32] here generates
[17:40] invoices where did I mess up oh I think
[17:43] MX AO
[17:48] maybe
[17:57] okay
[18:03] it's
[18:27] ready
[18:37] LG think yeah that's probably the reason
[18:40] it's a bit too much
[18:43] here
[18:49] base maybe we can make it
[18:53] 200 it's a little difference okay in
[18:57] here we so which we are going to copy is
[18:59] that thing
[19:01] here send them to customers track if
[19:04] they paid all right copilot is not bad
[19:08] just doesn't know the the real Hustle
[19:10] the waste two hours in customer
[19:27] support
[19:35] a of $2 per
[19:38] invoice near
[19:53] create and
[19:55] finally and update detail what
[20:13] generated I think this part is important
[20:16] so Nico made a tweet that uh went pretty
[20:18] viral in our little
[20:21] community and he said 50 messages from
[20:24] customers acting for
[20:27] invoices
[20:29] is it not
[20:31] available we got to see what people say
[20:34] I have the same what do you use to
[20:35] record
[20:38] this we I kind of want to see what
[20:40] people say there to try to reuse the
[20:42] same language to use
[20:45] so yeah that makes the that would
[20:47] hopefully make the copy a bit
[20:50] better can I add my V8 number to the
[20:52] invoice that is a
[20:56] part so we need yeah we need to to have
[20:58] some part I can't updates can't update
[21:00] details once
[21:15] [Music]
[21:20] generated issue than
[21:27] men do want
[21:44] question we have a comment here
[21:47] that
[21:49] sense feature date on your subscription
[21:53] so that's not for us have the same
[21:55] request mining up so far around five
[22:17] okay
[22:26] um
[22:34] so manually
[22:36] create it'll be the first
[22:43] one
[22:45] or or pay
[22:48] up man them or pay up to $2 per
[22:53] invoice power is
[22:56] wasted
[23:01] okay that's
[23:07] legit up toer
[23:09] invoice in Customer
[23:19] Support
[23:26] update
[23:35] I kind of want to say
[23:44] uh
[23:48] invoices Self Serve
[23:56] invoices
[24:39] we can reuse that sster invoices for
[24:42] your customers saler without invoice
[24:45] manually so manually create invoices a
[24:48] up to
[24:49] [Music]
[24:51] two up to $2 per invoice waste hours in
[24:55] customer
[24:56] support
[25:05] here we might want to save eat
[25:18] Etc I think that's legit
[25:26] uh
[25:34] Self Serve invoices for your
[25:42] customers see what we get
[25:56] here this is
[26:56] design
[27:11] iight all the tweets and put it in ch
[27:13] GPT and ask them for key terms oh that's
[27:15] a good
[27:20] idea that is a good ide
[27:26] sir
[28:05] like
[28:14] that not going to work no audio ah can
[28:20] you maybe that's why I'm
[28:22] speaking can you wait let me try the
[28:25] stream just maybe cuz sometimes I'm I'm
[28:27] also quiet I'm trying to think and I
[28:30] suck at thinking without why speaking so
[28:33] let me
[28:37] check okay I think the audio is live I
[28:40] was just trying to to think okay okay
[28:43] perfect yo
[28:48] Navin very Focus
[28:50] mon I thought you muted yet
[28:56] I'm think thinking thinking thinking is
[28:59] the new
[29:25] muted I think we get the why here um
[29:28] without same
[29:32] voice you can
[29:34] say
[29:36] traditional um
[29:40] default stripe invoice um stripe
[29:52] invoices yeah just do
[29:55] this it is not uh
[29:59] right invoices without Zen
[30:02] voice and of
[30:07] course of course we have the solution
[30:17] um
[30:22] Emeral here we are going to
[30:25] say and
[30:52] rolled
[30:56] with
[31:05] going back to the copy
[31:14] um Self Serve
[31:21] invoices
[31:25] alices oh yep we need for the config
[31:28] part so we are going to
[31:30] need where we need import um config I
[31:34] think y config and here we say
[31:39] pay config do stri
[31:43] do plans.
[31:46] Z
[31:52] price you're going to say one
[31:55] time okay
[31:57] is going to
[31:59] be
[32:06] here oh I think I know what I'm going to
[32:09] do yes I
[32:11] know hey one time generate unlimited
[32:17] invoices
[32:23] uh
[32:26] update
[32:35] upd editable editable
[32:40] invoices say compliance I think I will
[32:43] have to rework on
[32:47] that waste how ising customer support so
[32:50] here we need to have something that says
[32:54] uh no more customer support
[32:59] I'll need to re rework the copy a little
[33:02] bit trying to highlight gener
[33:11] forer
[33:14] invoices okay I think we're going to say
[33:16] this is
[33:22] with or
[33:25] maybe with
[33:31] SM right seems to be working
[33:55] um
[34:00] yes I like that better
[34:02] okay it's too red for some reason okay
[34:06] so this and probably here we will need
[34:10] two hero icons that says Cross or
[34:14] close micro and we are going to do
[34:19] a oh yeah I should have written
[34:21] this
[34:23] H an
[34:25] array an array
[34:29] of strings with the
[34:32] four uh piece of
[34:35] text below map over
[34:39] it and return a l
[34:49] item
[34:51] sh Mo Miss GPT I don't want to do it
[35:02] no read an AR
[35:06] stre hey come on I give you something
[35:12] here
[35:14]  this is not bad I think maybe we'll
[35:18] give it a little help we're going to say
[35:22] manually come on at this time you you
[35:24] should know
[35:25] man
[35:28] yes
[35:30] boy and we're going to say class um fle
[35:35] Gap 2 item
[35:37] Center and we are going to show the
[35:42] item and as well as this little cross
[35:46] there okay we can remove
[35:52] that and I think we can give
[35:55] it
[36:00] we can say shrink zero just in case and
[36:03] we can say text
[36:04] [Music]
[36:08] rows
[36:10] 600 or maybe just Tes row maybe
[36:19] opacity give it 60 maybe maybe
[36:25] 75
[36:34] um what do we have after relaxed we have
[36:38] lose
[36:40] okay okay maybe we want to make it
[36:55] lose
[37:06] this is better um and we will need to do
[37:09] the same stuff
[37:11] valid for the text the positive part
[37:16] there it is going to
[37:18] be
[37:23] here we need to do that here
[37:29] this and I hope you are going to be
[37:31] smart Mr
[37:32] GPT give me the entire stuff
[37:36] no no more customer support
[37:43] any you should do ASMR videos your voice
[37:47] is so relaxing wow that's when I
[37:50] appreciate it and I think that's
[37:51] probably the first uh time I've heard
[37:54] that I think it probably the mic that is
[37:57] making it sweeter than it really is I
[38:00] appreciate it man I will make sure to
[38:02] remind that to my wife later
[38:06] today software as a
[38:09] subscription um hello from twitch
[38:12] software as a subscription I guess if
[38:14] you're asking or if it's a question
[38:16] about SAS I think it's called software
[38:18] as a
[38:19] service and we're making a little
[38:21] software for stripe to generate invoices
[38:23] on
[38:25] autopilot
[38:28] SVG and we are going to
[38:31] add
[38:34] this right
[38:38] there all right C Ser
[38:53] invoices
[38:55] time
[39:15] yeah I know it's a service but these
[39:17] days it might as well be a subscription
[39:20] software as a
[39:21] subscription okay you have any example
[39:25] of that
[39:31] back to it so we have our invoices right
[39:33] here
[39:36] um think this is
[39:40] cool manually create invoice or pay up
[39:43] to to per
[39:48] invoice and here we're going to say
[39:50] unlimited for maybe we don't need to add
[39:53] these four unlimited
[39:55] invoices
[39:58] powered by
[40:00] stripe Self Service stripe invoice
[40:03] without
[40:04] invoice stripe invoices plus invoice s
[40:07] server invoices manually Cur invoices
[40:10] pay up to $2 per invoice or pay 49 one
[40:13] time for unlimited invoices hours in
[40:15] Customer Support no more customer
[40:17] support editable invoices to stay
[40:20] compliant can't update details on sent
[40:25] editable inves to stay
[40:28] compliant oh everything is a
[40:30] subscription oh I get okay I get what
[40:31] you mean yeah man I think it's a really
[40:33] good point you're raising uh actually I
[40:36] remove subscriptions from most of my
[40:38] products and this is doing way better
[40:40] for me uh this will not be a
[40:43] subscription product actually it's going
[40:45] to be a onetime payment thing so here it
[40:47] is you for the launch time you're going
[40:49] to pay 9949 and you're going to have
[40:52] unlimited invoices I try to stay away
[40:54] from subscriptions and this is working
[40:56] Well for
[41:02] now I think we have a little pricing
[41:05] page maybe it's a little bit too
[41:07] big maybe we need to make five Exel or
[41:11] something did that change anything no it
[41:13] didn't it did it's a good question what
[41:16] do we have here we have a 5 XL for
[41:25] that
[41:27] serve
[41:28] invoices Focus n
[41:42] invoices but dve myself trying to get
[41:45] into subscription model I have servers
[41:47] that cost every month so I need every
[41:48] income I
[41:51] mean I get I get the same I also have to
[41:54] run my servers but for instance my
[41:56] versal accounts which is where I host my
[41:59] front end and backend I have 20 plus
[42:02] apps running I also have um you can see
[42:06] the traffic here those is the entire
[42:09] traffic I get so my biggest app has 1.7k
[42:13] visitors per 24 hours um 600 for this
[42:17] one so I get maybe I don't know two to
[42:19] 3,000 visitors in total per day and my
[42:23] bill for versal which is almost almost
[42:25] the only bill that I have is like 20 or
[42:27] $25 per month and so I can't afford to
[42:32] you know make a products get couple
[42:34] thousand visitors and waste a couple
[42:36] cents on traffic I usually find that
[42:40] it's very easy to get profitable even
[42:43] without subscriptions unless you have I
[42:45] don't know whatever this is AI cost or a
[42:48] really heavy cost but like everything
[42:49] that's Bend width or even
[42:52] storage like it's pretty cheap nowadays
[42:55] and what you don't uh you know what you
[42:59] spend what you don't what what you get
[43:02] from not having subscription which mean
[43:03] more customers because it's much easier
[43:05] to sell a one time payment in the end
[43:07] you it will cover the next band Witter
[43:10] also
[43:13] so is that the cloud service you're
[43:15] using better option I do not know about
[43:17] VPS uh and I have no idea I have no idea
[43:21] I've been using versal since I started
[43:22] coding and Heroku a little bit in the
[43:25] past
[43:26] um this it's just working for me it's uh
[43:29] 20 bucks per month you can have
[43:31] unlimited apps and I think you
[43:34] are U this is an overview of what I use
[43:38] per month uh you see here I am going
[43:41] over the image optimization stuff
[43:43] because I'm trying to play around with
[43:45] SEO so I might spend 25 bucks this month
[43:47] instead of 20 middleware invocation okay
[43:51] maybe 26 bucks this month bandwidth I'm
[43:54] 133% so I'm far far far from reaching
[43:57] over than that my bill has never been
[44:00] over $25 or $26 per month so far and
[44:04] I've been doing this for two years and
[44:06] I've had website going viral couple
[44:08] thousand visitors per
[44:10] day see not sure about VPS
[44:15] though you have a customer I think one
[44:18] time payment are kind of logic with
[44:19] monthly payment you have a customer
[44:21] lifetime value one time payment all you
[44:23] to get this customer value completely in
[44:25] the first payments yes that is a good
[44:28] point here and from customer 10 points
[44:31] man just you know I boat this little
[44:34] thing here our ring it is quite pricey I
[44:38] think this is probably
[44:39] $400 to track my fitness and my slip and
[44:45] I cancelled my free trial after it
[44:48] expired um it's like $6 per month to
[44:52] access the data and this is stupid but
[44:55] you you know I just I don't know just
[44:58] the fact that I pay monthly for
[44:59] something that makes
[45:00] me just I don't know it creates some
[45:03] where I I'm going to really really
[45:05] really value how much how much I get
[45:08] from this and whether I decide or not to
[45:10] pay for it if they have kept it or if
[45:12] they actually if they increased the
[45:13] price by $100 and they made it like I
[45:15] don't know 500 or 600 I would have buy
[45:17] the ring and not even think but now I
[45:20] don't use the ring anymore and they
[45:22] don't get my data so it's I don't know
[45:23] it's I feel it's a bit broken for some
[45:26] for some system I think like if there is
[45:27] no
[45:28] recurring um value you get from it there
[45:31] is no point of having
[45:35] subscriptions you started
[45:37] Forevers where do you host your database
[45:39] I I host my database on Atlas mongodb
[45:43] and I have um so which is
[45:46] free um and I when I get a business that
[45:50] relies on data like for instance Indie
[45:52] page where people store their uh data
[45:57] here so it's like a Linkin bio or a mini
[46:00] LinkedIn for startup
[46:03] Founders so there some datas are being
[46:06] stored in the database for that I paid
[46:08] for backups on mongodb Atlas which is I
[46:11] think seven bucks per month so in case
[46:13] something goes wrong I can retrieve the
[46:15] data otherwise if it's not uh important
[46:19] like if it's uh I don't if I can afford
[46:22] to lose the data because it's not big
[46:23] deal then I I just have a free database
[46:32] would it cost you anything to export
[46:34] your data if you want to move to another
[46:36] cloud service usually this is how you
[46:37] get
[46:39] luck this is a good question man yeah
[46:41] that's RS will kind of have my
[46:44] uh yeah if if I don't know something
[46:47] goes wrong and I have to move to another
[46:49] service I have no clue how I'm going to
[46:50] do
[46:52] that is it's even worse than
[46:54] Banks
[46:57] you have a recommendation for a host for
[47:00] a postra database I have no clue when I
[47:03] think super base I heard it's good uh
[47:06] but I cannot I cannot uh tell really
[47:09] because I don't really use it for
[47:12] production what does that even mean
[47:14] several lless function execution
[47:18] um I don't even know where that is I'm
[47:21] I'm um I look at the I just look at the
[47:24] dollar sign here and just make sure it
[47:26] doesn't go over the roof that's the only
[47:28] thing I know here I don't I don't really
[47:29] look at
[47:33] it but the
[47:38] expert right time to build then
[47:43] um yeah we want to keep that so we are
[47:46] going back to the Ling
[47:49] page what do we have here maybe maybe
[47:53] maybe see
[48:04] that better yeah that creates a little
[48:05] bit more spicy spicy it is a spicy
[48:09] landing
[48:12] page all right I think that's a bit
[48:14] better it creates more space and we
[48:17] might want to do the same for The Gap
[48:19] and then I will stop procrastinating
[48:21] with colors and just move on okay sell
[48:25] services for your customers stripe
[48:26] invoices without invoice stripe invoices
[48:28] plus
[48:33] invoice
[48:35] okay all right we're going
[48:37] to rerun that a little bit later and
[48:40] then we're going to move on to the other
[48:42] part so now we have the hero section
[48:44] with the demo here so whenever someone
[48:46] LS on landing page they will see those
[48:48] annoying notifications on the top
[48:51] right Focus start up not invoices L your
[48:53] customer generate and their start
[48:55] invoices so you don't have to call to
[48:57] action bullet point
[49:02] okay sell serve invoices okay so
[49:05] customer can serve the invoices don't no
[49:08] more customer support editable invoice
[49:09] to say complaint and then we
[49:12] need some kind of how it works like one
[49:16] to three you know to show the flow and I
[49:20] think we will make small videos for that
[49:24] maybe
[49:31] um well maybe we just copy a piece of
[49:34] text maybe we'll just copy the text
[49:37] maybe we don't need actually
[49:39] video uh it's kind of boring
[49:51] though we're going to add a new section
[49:53] to the Ling page and see how that goes
[49:56] import
[49:59] features
[50:01] um oh I think I'm I'm not going to be
[50:03] using a fast component because I
[50:06] need something a bit different this
[50:08] time I think I need something like this
[50:13] actually I need something like that one
[50:15] two three photo on the left or on the
[50:21] right that's what I need
[50:24] here
[50:26] for
[50:28] features I can just use that component
[50:31] and delete
[50:34] it which one should I be your listicles
[50:42] maybe yeah of course if I don't add it
[50:44] to the page this is not going to be
[50:46] shown
[50:54] us
[50:58] I probably want to do this too so I
[51:02] think those annoying notifications are
[51:04] nice but
[51:05] when why is it
[51:11] there okay
[51:14] I I think it is
[51:18] because because I changed the position
[51:20] somewhere lay layout
[51:23] layout container Style
[51:33] container
[51:42] um let me
[51:45] think I would I how would I add media
[51:49] queries
[51:51] here does anyone know um I'm using react
[51:55] hot
[51:56] toast uh the container style I would
[51:59] like it to be
[52:01] three RM
[52:04] only on large devices like tablets or
[52:09] desktops and right here it is
[52:17] shown yes I need to change the inside
[52:20] here
[52:22] so what a media query
[52:26] a
[52:27] react good question container
[52:33] Ty media queries when no
[52:36] they and keep different size and
[52:38] different FES oh
[52:41] yeah
[52:53] it right
[52:59] yes of course this is not how I'm going
[53:00] to do it um
[53:03] um or or no no no no okay I know what
[53:07] I'm going to do this was not a smart
[53:10] move I'm going to say left and so these
[53:13] should be even yes sir okay that's
[53:19] better okay I think this is fixed anyway
[53:22] I don't need to yeah okay this good
[53:30] and we need to remove those remove like
[53:32] the entire we need to clear the
[53:37] interval when the user pass through a
[53:39] certain point of the page because this
[53:43] becomes
[53:51] annoying so wherever this is we should
[53:56] have click
[54:07] interval so this and here
[54:15] if if user
[54:19] scroll
[54:21] as the
[54:23] hero hero
[54:25] section stop the interval and remove all
[54:28] toasts let's see how that works Roll
[54:32] Clear
[54:33] [Music]
[54:39] interval oh pass the hero section after
[54:47] the rolling at least the screen
[54:54] height
[55:01] window okay
[55:07] if let's see what we got here it's not
[55:11] dismiss oh yeah okay it's dismiss okay
[55:13] let's see so we have just one two three
[55:17] okay and nope it is not
[55:24] working
[55:27] here we want to do
[55:54] um that function is not being called
[55:57] where did I mess
[56:04] up looks like I am not actually
[56:07] scrolling oh no no okay that works
[56:13] now 747 what is that thing
[56:23] here
[56:48] toast remove
[56:50] [Music]
[56:53] all
[56:56] to instantly to are
[57:00] remove h no tell me there is something
[57:03] to dismiss all the toast maybe not toast
[57:07] does
[57:10] dismiss
[57:23] see
[57:29] all right here we're going to okay so we
[57:31] here we stopped sending the notification
[57:34] which is
[57:37] good I think see if that works or
[57:53] not
[58:01] uh Yep this is not going to work
[58:23] remove
[58:33] okay one of them
[58:52] worked yeah just conso Lo the tost
[59:02] this one is the one that
[59:04] works let's try it
[59:08] again okay that looks like it's working
[59:11] now we need to
[59:18] um going to do something like that
[59:21] where
[59:23] is
[59:25] that's map
[59:27] that's each message
[59:31] we this is quite dirty but it doesn't
[59:35] matter this we are going to
[59:38] return the index string
[59:42] index and then for
[59:45] each no no no no we don't even need to
[59:47] do that for
[59:50] each
[59:52] TNI we're going to say remove
[59:58] let's get back to
[60:00] it I have two
[60:02] toasts I'm going to scroll up and he
[60:05] removes them okay and dismiss maybe
[60:09] let's see would be a nicer
[60:15] way okay not
[60:18] bad visible
[60:23] animate
[60:37] don't care about that
[60:42] uh see we have one
[60:46] toast two
[60:50] toasts we are going to scroll and they
[60:52] should be dismissed okay
[60:55] this is better
[60:58] now we make sure that we remove the
[61:01] handle scroll listener we remove the
[61:05] interval
[61:10] okay although although although although
[61:13] there is something with
[61:16] the ah I think it's because I'm using a
[61:19] retina display so it's probably not
[61:23] knowing when I pass
[61:28] the let's start
[61:32] again so 30 scroll out I think it's
[61:37] because is
[61:42] it and only now it's going to remove
[61:45] those
[61:48] um it says the dog you can toast thanks
[61:51] man oh wow thanks ni all I wish I had
[61:55] seen that before I like to build some
[61:58] code for no reason
[62:07] sometimes when
[62:14] user let's see let's see let's
[62:17] see I'm here I load the page I get those
[62:21] notifications okay going to scroll
[62:26] then here they're going to be
[62:29] removed I probably want them to be
[62:31] removed a little bit
[62:34] earlier this is quite
[62:48] annoying we can
[62:53] see
[62:58] plus 200
[63:03] maybe
[63:06] see okay that looks like a
[63:10] good good place to remove those
[63:23] notifications
[63:25] okay does it work on mobile let's
[63:36] see okay here when we get there we are
[63:39] getting no more notifications okay going
[63:43] back to the features
[63:46] listicles I think we won't need any of
[63:49] that we also probably won't any of those
[63:53] this is going to be a very very simple
[63:54] component with a very few
[63:58] things don't need that and we don't need
[64:02] that basically just a placeholder
[64:09] component
[64:12] um see what we get in the copy we had
[64:15] something that says sub
[64:19] spending
[64:23] um
[64:26] oh maybe that could be the headline for
[64:28] the let's
[64:31] see that could
[64:33] be in the here
[64:42] section see what we got now we have this
[64:45] TI of managing stripe invoices stripe
[64:48] invoices with invoice without invoice
[64:50] plus invoice okay here we have sell
[64:53] serve invoices for for your customers
[64:55] and we can have 1 2
[64:59] 3 seems like the way to
[65:11] go self Ser invoices for
[65:16] customers right I think in this part
[65:19] we'll have to explain a little bit um
[65:22] actually not a little bit quite in
[65:23] details how the product
[65:26] works it time for me to get a little
[65:28] [Music]
[65:53] lunchtime
[66:37] re
[66:53] custom
[67:00] all right
[67:05] um one two
[67:19] three let's see if we get some nice
[67:22] Tae
[67:29] I think it is features maybe feature SE
[67:32] there we
[67:37] go oh actually I can
[67:48] use
[67:51] actually that would be a great use use
[67:54] for a ship fast component I think
[67:58] um yes I probably used the wrong
[68:01] component let's see if we get something
[68:03] better with the
[68:04] features
[68:08] accordion in three steps so
[68:12] up we are going to add the title
[68:16] somewhere
[68:22] there
[68:25] and in the page we can replace this
[68:28] light
[68:31] features accordion is it how it's called
[68:34] I think it
[68:35] is and
[68:37] here we
[68:39] have a three steps part where we can say
[68:43] a connect your strip account to send the
[68:46] link and three cell serve
[68:52] invoices that could work work out with
[68:54] images on the right to show probably we
[68:57] need we have less text to show so we can
[68:59] make
[69:02] features can make
[69:05] it like this this could actually be a
[69:09] bit
[69:14] smaller and instead of having emails and
[69:17] section in said we could
[69:18] [Music]
[69:22] have
[69:25] probably here we want to
[69:28] say it item
[69:31] item maybe the index of the
[69:37] item
[69:44] oops one two three oh
[69:48] actually love
[69:50] you emails and here we could have
[69:53] something that that
[69:54] says um connect your stripe
[69:59] [Music]
[70:00] accounts con STP
[70:02] accounts here we can say
[70:10] um let
[70:14] your send link to your customers send
[70:17] link to your
[70:19] customers sending to customers and here
[70:21] we would have some like um
[70:25] customers
[70:27] generates
[70:28] generates customers generate invoices we
[70:32] don't need that
[70:33] part and we have a one two three steps
[70:37] image or video on the right this should
[70:40] not be
[70:41] here oh okay no it should be here
[70:49] yeah it should be here okay
[70:52] um so here connect your strap
[70:59] accounts sending to your customers
[71:01] customers generate invoices one two
[71:03] three
[71:05] steps I think this is quite
[71:22] Goods send L to your customers and
[71:25] generate generate invoice
[71:47] autoing
[71:52] notifications
[72:02] it's fun that notification doesn't go
[72:04] away why is oh because yes
[72:08] okay oh yeah yeah
[72:16] yeah hey remove oh this is the
[72:22] interval
[72:40] extra maybe here we give
[72:52] it
[73:00] and those scroll we want to give it
[73:03] the lar
[73:08] interval is my
[73:14] interval we give it a function and we
[73:18] say we pass that
[73:22] function
[73:24] do we need to do that maybe we can just
[73:25] do
[73:30] that interval and I think we also need
[73:32] to do the exact same thing
[73:51] here window up
[74:04] all right is this going to
[74:10] work arguments record
[74:20] um yes of
[74:22] course
[74:28] one notification
[74:32] two okay that's working and now if I
[74:34] reloads in the middle of the page I
[74:36] should not I did get one no no
[74:43] [Music]
[74:52] no
[74:58] oh yeah of course we need to clear the
[74:59] time
[75:07] out
[75:21] um what you're doing
[75:24] Mark what is
[75:39] that c time out instead of clear
[75:52] trouble yes of course I messed it
[76:04] up oh maybe
[76:21] this okay that was abs L
[76:24] useless this is not even working
[76:28] anymore does
[76:30] work is it no I think it is working
[76:33] now
[76:41] okay oh
[76:44]  this
[76:45] is I didn't sign up for
[76:49] this
[76:52] oh
[77:13] oh it looks like I don't get any bug for
[77:15] now so I'm going to leave
[77:17] it and going to run with it they have
[77:21] bugs yep I do have a bug here here
[77:23] because I didn't
[77:25] reload let's see if there is a really a
[77:28] real real engineer there there's no need
[77:31] to you can go live on X yes you can so
[77:34] the component runers and and firing the
[77:37] function again and again the component
[77:39] reenders and firing the function again
[77:41] and again
[77:50] um I think well
[77:53] I I won't aim for this to work perfectly

[127:36] are yes we are
[127:41] okay welcome welcome welcome back so
[127:43] this is day seven of the live stream
[127:46] building a little software startup here
[127:48] on Twitter twitch and YouTube we are
[127:52] making a stripe invoice generator and
[127:55] editor um let me show you if I can have
[127:58] a working example of this um you connect
[128:00] all your strap accounts and then you
[128:02] have a uni link that lets your customers
[128:04] retrieve and edit and download their
[128:07] invoices from any of your stripe
[128:10] accounts um B they get a unique link and
[128:13] they see all the purchases they made
[128:15] with your business they can view the
[128:17] details you have your business data on
[128:19] the left and there is the customer data
[128:21] on the right they can edit the invoice
[128:23] before they get it um sometimes
[128:26] Europeans usually they need to add their
[128:28] V number uh or whatever to the invoice
[128:31] and then they click download and boom
[128:34] they have a functional invoice here they
[128:37] can use for accountability or
[128:39] whatever this is working the product was
[128:41] built in the first days of the stream
[128:43] and now we are working on the Ling page
[128:46] um we have built we've made the copy
[128:49] with niik Jan
[128:51] Jan whatever um he came on the live
[128:55] stream last week we made a copy so we
[128:57] have um a word here Google doc it's a
[129:00] Google doc we have a Google doc with all
[129:02] the copy that's needed um we have made
[129:06] the hero sections already we have a
[129:08] little demo not not a demo but like a
[129:10] reminder um for people using stripe what
[129:13] how annoying is it to really to receive
[129:16] email about invoice
[129:19] um there it
[129:20] is and then when we scroll we have a
[129:23] with and without and now we are
[129:25] designing this feature section which is
[129:27] somehow like how it
[129:29] works and this is going to be in three
[129:32] steps first connect your strap account
[129:34] second send your link to your customers
[129:36] and
[129:37] third third is going to be um generate
[129:41] invoices customer generate invoices by
[129:43] themselves um I think I'm going to shoot
[129:45] a little video for each of those I hope
[129:49] I can do this on the live stream I think
[129:50] I can I'm going to be using SC screen
[129:52] studio and we will be uh we should be
[129:56] done with the landing page by hopefully
[129:59] today and if possible I would love to
[130:02] get Mr Dan kov on the stream someday to
[130:04] roast a landing page this will be a fun
[130:07] thing uh if you guys know him U please
[130:11] tag him on Twitter tell him to come tell
[130:14] him that um this is more important than
[130:16] playing paddle
[130:19] and hopefully you'll be joining and
[130:20] roasting that Ling
[130:23] page okay um one little thing
[130:28] here buing
[130:31] me it's too
[130:33] [Music]
[130:43] green okay
[130:45] so
[130:46] uh actually we could have used a color
[130:49] primary DG
[131:01] primary no too much
[131:07] okay okay we're going to remain with
[131:10] emerald and I'm going to still
[131:12] procrastinating with
[131:14] this come on Mark
[131:17] okay
[131:18] all right so we're back sell serve
[131:20] invoices for customers and here we want
[131:22] to
[131:24] add conect strip accounts
[131:27] so we want a couple things here we want
[131:30] to say Fe
[131:47] accordians is it going to work it should
[131:50] work let's
[131:55] see it is working
[132:16] okay think secondary okay good good good
[132:21] we we
[132:22] connect one your connect Tri accounts so
[132:26] um how we going to do
[132:33] that
[132:35] add
[132:37] any my account you
[132:43] want customers to be able to generate
[132:58] it
[132:58] takes few
[133:01] seconds just a few seconds it takes just
[133:03] a few seconds to add a
[133:08] new
[133:09] [Music]
[133:16] account
[133:19] secured
[133:22] using oops where are
[133:26] we stripe API restricted API
[133:45] Keys No code
[133:49] no coding
[133:52] required no coding required this is
[133:56] important it takes just a few seconds to
[133:58] add a new account and it's secured
[134:04] using it's not quote
[134:06] actually it's
[134:11] this A+
[134:16] okay
[134:18] and
[134:22] it's
[134:24] um maybe we'll make just an image for
[134:27] that because that's not very very
[134:45] important custom
[134:51] maybe maybe maybe maybe we can take a
[134:54] screenshot of
[135:05] that and here we can say
[135:09] um
[135:14] start Z invoice maybe here we can have a
[135:17] square
[135:18] whatever 180 by
[135:22] 180 show
[135:26] that we can also have a background color
[135:30] of
[135:32] this and what we can do is oh wait may I
[135:36] need just higher
[135:39] quality big
[135:41] [Music]
[135:44] zoom
[135:46] up
[135:48] here nice and
[135:52] clean full height and here we going to
[135:54] say maybe going to make a little
[136:00] component we can fill it with
[136:04] white uh borders will
[136:07] be whatever 50 no that's too much 35
[136:13] maybe
[136:15] 35 TR
[136:18] Str stroke stroke would
[136:21] be the exact same
[136:26] color probably two or
[136:29] three all right it look a little bit
[136:31] like the
[136:32] [Music]
[136:34] same and we are going to
[136:37] make maybe
[136:39] four and supposed to
[136:43] be um Dash there we go and we're going
[136:46] to say add a new account
[136:49] here
[136:51] plus add new
[136:54] account and I think we're using we are
[136:57] using the font gabarito which is the one
[137:00] I'm going to be using font
[137:06] bold this color
[137:08] is this one
[137:12] here and I think it's going to be a
[137:15] phone 48 Maybe
[137:22] a beit too small
[137:29] 64
[137:46] okay
[137:55] group that and we can say
[138:09] [Music]
[138:11] bingo that as well and we are going to
[138:14] display it in the
[138:16] center
[138:22] I think what we can
[138:28] do I
[138:30] think this useless
[138:36] part should we make it this color or
[138:38] should we make it
[138:46] black
[138:50] kind of cool just to show that you can
[138:52] have multiple serp accounts and we can
[138:55] explore
[138:56] that say
[139:00] whatever then we are maybe going to
[139:04] style this a little bit otherwise it
[139:05] will look
[139:07] weird on the page
[139:10] so clean shot X and see if we can add a
[139:15] little bit
[139:16] of
[139:18] and see
[139:24] gradients
[139:26] here maybe
[139:30] green add anything okay that's pretty
[139:39] cool I want to keep a light color maybe
[139:43] this one that
[139:46] one
[139:52] all right let's try to export that
[139:56] thing which we are going to say
[140:00] feature
[140:02] one and we want to put it in our app
[140:06] folder
[140:08] nope app okay going back here we are
[140:12] going to import the feature one image
[140:20] at feature one and here in this part
[140:23] we're going to say I think it's called
[140:24] video
[140:27] image image and we're going to
[140:35] say Type image and the path will
[140:40] be we don't need and let's see if that
[140:43] works cannot resolve that
[140:46] image
[140:48] whatever oh yeah of
[140:51] course
[140:58] okay let's see what we got um it is
[141:02] cropped how did we get the image here
[141:09] youan oh I think I know
[141:16] why
[141:25] do we need this background probably no
[141:27] we probably don't need this is not
[141:29] beautiful
[141:31] so BR back to figma we're just going to
[141:34] export that thing remove the
[141:37] noise all that feature one
[141:40] image
[141:44] here
[141:46] see
[141:49] replace that should be better still not
[141:53] okay I think it's because we need to add
[141:55] a we need the image to be somewhere
[142:00] inside oh yeah size width object cover
[142:03] object
[142:08] Center what is the actual size of that
[142:11] oh
[142:16] yeah okay object contain and I think we
[142:19] are going to round
[142:21] that rounded
[142:25] Excel round it he doesn't want to
[142:29] round did I make a typo
[142:31] [Music]
[142:44] somewhere what are you doing mark
[142:47] oh maybe
[142:49] here oh yeah okay
[142:55] okay actually they should be rounded
[143:01] no oh it's
[143:05] because oh yes yes
[143:16] yes
[143:36] oh yeah okay the aspect Square okay
[143:38] that's where I messed up
[143:41] okay okay connect your STP account Zen
[143:44] Voice by dispute in the page add new
[143:46] account okay it just take a few seconds
[143:48] to add new account and it's secured
[143:49] using Straight rested API Keys No coding
[143:51] required send link to your customers
[143:53] that's the second
[143:55] part which

[153:14] will okay
[153:16] here we go we are becoming designers
[153:26] now so it would have something like this

[169:09] does it look
[169:10] now maybe
[169:13] terrible
[169:15] let's see I think I've lost oh that's
[169:18] why I don't see it I think I've lost my
[169:19] tab switching
[169:21] stuff it's working but just I cannot see
[169:24] which tab I'm going to maybe it's
[169:26] because oh I know it's because I have
[169:29] the other
[169:32] screen that is messed up um display
[169:35] maybe I hope it doesn't up the
[169:38] stream let me know if you can still see
[169:40] my screen I'm going to try
[169:43] something
[169:46] um what is it this is it this should be
[169:50] that let's see how the stream looks
[169:58] like
[170:04] okay okay it's still
[170:07] working hello
[170:09] Joe um is there to create a fake email
[170:12] conversation uh maybe
[170:15] I was a figma oriented
[170:19] today Inception this is it this is the
[170:21] Inception
[170:23] man I think we're going way deeper than
[170:25] they did in the movie it's probably like
[170:27] 10 or 20 levels
[170:31] here all right let's see how that looks
[170:36] now connect stripe accounts Zeno by
[170:39] dispute at new account
[170:41] okay okay this is okay this is okay
[170:48] [Music]
[170:51] like Bush invoice
[170:53] please um share your link so customers
[170:56] can generate invoices for any of the
[170:57] payments and all your s accounts you can
[170:59] Ade the link on the user dashboard as
[171:06] well if you can say send your link to
[171:10] customers so they can generate invoice
[171:12] you can also unbend the link of on a
[171:14] user dashboard for
[171:17] instance and then three customer
[171:19] generate
[171:26] invoice and I think for this part I am
[171:28] going to make a little
[171:30] video why because why
[171:36] not because we might want to show that
[171:39] part here edit on download your
[171:43] invoices
[171:59] okay
[172:01] um I probably going
[172:11] to let's
[172:13] see
[172:15] Gmail your Zenvo link where it
[172:43] is
[173:01] content so maybe we can't say something
[173:04] like
[173:07] this C the
[173:11] link you
[173:19] [Music]

[173:46] stream all right I'll see oh no maybe
[173:49] actually I don't you can see my green
[173:51] screen bingo I think I don't need

[173:55] make things
[173:58] simpler remove my
[174:00] face I camera preview don't record
[174:10] camera no microphone no system audio
[174:13] Studio display camera camera
[174:16] [Music]

[174:20] think don't record
[174:25] camera all right
[174:30] um I think we'll need to make an
[174:35] entire think we're going to make these
[174:37] videos

[222:29] tab stop wasting how maging stri this
[222:33] STP invy reduce customer support and
[222:35] focus on your
[222:38] startup then make
[222:49] sense TR invoice Fe custom use on your
[223:04] startup these
[223:08] counts the Voice
[223:38] Link
[224:03] is invo limited Self Serve
[224:07] invoices limitate strap account
[224:09] complaint
[224:12] no
[224:15] minute maybe we don't need to say it's
[224:17] compliance it's kind
[224:20] of implied somehow like it makes it's
[224:23] normal to have compliant invoices it's
[224:25] not really a feature I think the fq will
[224:29] be important here so we are going to
[224:32] reuse another Shi fast
[224:36] components called f
[224:38] IQ and
[224:41] and bingo we have an fq right
[224:46] here so I think I have a few questions
[224:50] in mind so first is
[224:56] um uh what's invoice it's a good
[225:08] question
[225:18] can can
[225:25] customers can people

[225:38] into psychiatrist mode right here what
[225:40] is the meaning of life is this a real
[225:56] question exactly uh let's go back to the
[225:59] list of questions if we had

[237:04] yes uh very
[237:06] clean you thank you thank you
[237:09] don't pay additional
[237:12] fees will you have only one plan option
[237:15] you share in the past that is better to
[237:17] have several options for users to feel
[237:19] they are getting more value I think so
[237:24] um because I don't know I don't I
[237:26] haven't thought about it much to be
[237:28] honest but I think there is it's a very
[237:31] tiny product and I don't know what else
[237:34] I could I could
[237:37] offer
[237:39] the thing yeah for now there is only one
[237:41] plan that one plan that comes in
[237:45] mind oh much time did you did it took
[237:49] how much time did it take for you to
[237:51] learn the code things I want to learn
[237:57] to I've been coding for six years and I
[238:01] spent the first four years
[238:03] doing the wrong the really wrong way
[238:06] learning Frameworks before learning the
[238:08] proper language so I learn stuff like
[238:12] react native without knowing how to do
[238:15] JavaScript so I think it would be much
[238:17] faster if I learned now and also I
[238:20] didn't know back then but I was learning
[238:22] everything I could and this was not the
[238:24] smart thing because uh as you can see
[238:26] when I'm programming I'm always doing
[238:28] the same thing over and over I don't do
[238:30] any complicated stuff um so there
[238:33] there's a bunch of stuff that are
[238:34] absolutely useless when you
[238:37] code and I didn't know that so I learned
[238:39] kind of everything and this was not
[238:42] needed so yeah couple years I think I
[238:46] don't know I
[238:47] think within 3 months fulltime you can
[238:52] become from zero to making apps like
[238:55] those
[238:58] ones yeah it's safe to say
[239:04] that and it's yours
[239:07] forever
[239:09] D the reduce customer support and focus
[239:11] on your start link unlimited sell serve
[239:13] invoices Unlimited St accounts one
[239:15] minute no Cod setup do I have to use
[239:17] stripe yes does it work for one time
[239:19] purchase does it work if I don't use
[239:21] tripe
[239:22] ining
[239:24] yes you work for past transactions it
[239:27] does is it secure where
[239:32] is this right here okay yes we use TR to
[239:37] access we use restricted API keys to
[239:40] access your account using the minimum
[239:41] recorded data gener inv it and customers
[239:44] see other other
[239:47] other customers can only view edit and
[239:50] download their own invoices if a
[239:51] customer retrieves a payment if a
[239:53] customer retrieves a payment they will
[239:55] have to comp the email address to view
[239:56] to access and edit access the payment
[239:59] data
[240:03] okay I think this is
[240:07] probably
[240:10] off I'm going to check my rber
[240:26] access
[240:28] secure
[240:30] yes yes okay and finally we are going to
[240:34] bring the last part of the Ling page
[240:37] which is a
[240:40] future
[240:52] um St list your
[240:55] customer strip
[240:57] invoices it easy let your customer
[241:00] generate and download invoices
[241:03] themselves no manual work no stripe fee
[241:06] no stripe fee
[241:09] no more copy pasting no more
[241:15] headache no more manual work no strip Fe
[241:18] no more headaches
[241:21] okayy right is good support goes to my
[241:26] email yes pricing links to here the blog
[241:31] does not
[241:32] exist um the footer
[241:37] blog should be

[241:43] also
[241:48] removed actually I'm testing a lot of
[241:53] stuff there is no affiliate program for
[241:56] Zenvo but I have a feeling that
[242:02] Google will actually push some okay it's
[242:06] is just a test let's see that works
[242:08] right we get the footer um we probably
[242:10] want to do the fiq
[242:22] with okay all right we have a landing
[242:25] page

[243:03] shaking I have my little
[243:07] setup
[243:20] oops refund found

[244:41] page I'll have to go back to it
[244:45] tomorrow to very like yeah always double
[244:48] check the learning page um because it's
[244:51] never perfect especially not in the
[244:53] first
[244:54] time it's not buggy okay so we have
[244:58] those S of notifications at the top
[245:01] right we have a checkout link that is
