[00:00] adding a free plan to your product
[00:01] sounds like a good idea but it's killing
[00:03] your Revenue only 3% of free users will
[00:06] upgrade to the Premium plan let's take
[00:08] an example let's say you have a free
[00:10] plan and a $10 per month plan that means
[00:13] your average user is worth 30 cents to
[00:15] your business now let's say that you
[00:16] need about $3,000 per month in order to
[00:19] maintain your lifestyle that means you
[00:21] will need 10,000 new users every month
[00:24] or about 75,000 monthly visitors I don't
[00:27] know how about you but that sounds like
[00:28] an insane amount of work for solo
[00:30] entrepreneurs especially if you have a 9
[00:32] to5 and you have to handle everything
[00:34] for a startup there are three
[00:35] alternatives to free plans in case you
[00:38] somehow need to show a part of your
[00:39] product to customers before they
[00:40] purchase the first one is offering free
[00:43] credits you basically let your users try
[00:45] your product but for a very limited
[00:47] usage the second alternative is having a
[00:49] short free trial with a credit card
[00:51] ahead and the third alternative which is
[00:53] my favorite as a developer is to take a
[00:55] standalone feature of your app and make
[00:57] it as a free
