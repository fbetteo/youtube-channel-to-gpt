[00:00] let's talk about Tex Tac I get a lot of
[00:01] suggestion from software Engineers who
[00:03] mention that I could save some money by
[00:05] switching to another text Tac or maybe a
[00:07] new UI components Library that's trendy
[00:09] but I never listen to them and I always
[00:11] stick to the exact same text stack and
[00:13] thanks to that in the last 2 years I was
[00:14] able to ship 21 products and those
[00:17] products are getting 260,000 page views
[00:19] per month and are making over $50,000 in
[00:22] revenue and I'm working solo and I
[00:24] handle the customer support and there is
[00:26] barely any problem and the Tex tack only
[00:28] cost 67 us per month all right now let
[00:31] me show you exactly the tech that I use
[00:33] all right so for the front end part I
[00:35] use reactjs it's a very popular
[00:37] JavaScript library it has a bunch of
[00:39] extra Library like drag and drop
[00:41] features for instance that can plug and
[00:43] play right away and some people say that
[00:45] it's quite complicated I only know 10%
[00:47] of reacts I just use use State and use
[00:50] effects in 99% of the cases it's way
[00:52] enough for all my apps then I pack all
[00:54] that into a nextjs application it's very
[00:57] good for page routing and to have nice
[00:59] page is ranking on Google and it's also
[01:01] super easy to use to style my apps I use
[01:03] tawin CSS I feel like it's much easier
[01:06] than CSS because the style is return
[01:08] return directly on the right HTML tags
[01:10] so it's easy for me to understand what's
[01:12] going on and on top of that I use a UI
[01:14] Library called Daisy UI it has a bunch
[01:16] of components like uh buttons form cards
[01:20] that make things way faster to ship
[01:22] there are a bunch of new design Trends
[01:24] popping up every day which means new UI
[01:26] components libraries coming out and to
[01:28] me that's just distraction customer
[01:30] don't care if I'm using the latest
[01:31] gradient colors or whatever so I stick
[01:33] to that UI Library it's clear it's
[01:35] simple they have 30 or 20 plus themes
[01:38] that I can customize so whenever I ship
[01:40] a new app I would pick a theme and find
[01:43] a cool type face on Google phones and
[01:45] boom I have an entirely design cool
[01:48] looking apps that's up and running all
[01:50] right and for the backend part for my
[01:52] API I would use next year's serverless
[01:54] functions whenever I clone a Nexus
[01:56] project I just add a file in the API
[01:59] folder and I have an entire API endpoint
[02:01] that's up and running I don't need to
[02:03] install packages I don't need to
[02:04] maintain an OS it's just working so well
[02:06] for me and I never had any trouble with
[02:08] overcharge for several less so all good
[02:10] with that for the database I use mongodb
[02:12] I don't know why developers don't like
[02:13] mongodb I love it it's so simple I click
[02:16] a button I open a new database and in
[02:18] minutes I can make queries and I can add
[02:20] anything I want to that database it's
[02:22] just so simple and I absolutely love it
[02:24] I set up a m0 cluster for each new
[02:27] project that I start which is free and
[02:30] just in case things go wrong I do
[02:32] occasional backups cost me about $10 per
[02:34] month and so if something goes wrong I
[02:36] can still use a database backup and
[02:38] restore all the previous data when I'm
[02:40] coding on my computer I use a local
[02:42] version of mongodb that lets me avoid
[02:45] making a network request to the
[02:47] production database when I'm coding so I
[02:49] can code in a train in a plane remote
[02:51] somewhere in the countryside if there is
[02:52] no internet and the the database is here
[02:55] and I can do everything I want and I
[02:57] also don't mess up the production
[02:59] database just in case on top of mongodb
[03:00] I add mongus which simplifies the
[03:03] queries they're more English friendly I
[03:05] would say all right and all my apps use
[03:06] user logins to send things like magic
[03:09] links so that they can sign up with a
[03:11] secure token I would use mun as an email
[03:13] provider for that it's free to get
[03:15] started it's super easy and you can set
[03:17] up a bunch of domains that you want for
[03:19] each of the apps at the moment I'm
[03:21] recording the video I spend three to
[03:23] four us per month in order to send 3 to
[03:26] 4,000 emails which I think is really
[03:28] cheap and finally I use stripe in order
[03:30] to process payments whether it's onetime
[03:32] payments subscriptions credits it works
[03:34] for literally anything stripe API is a
[03:36] little bit daunting when you are getting
[03:38] started there are a bunch of things
[03:40] going on so I will link to an article
[03:41] that I wrote to help you handle stripe
[03:43] subscriptions all right so for the
[03:45] hosting part where my websites are
[03:47] actually leing I use versal for that uh
[03:49] so I push my changes to a GitHub repo
[03:52] and then versal automatically pulls the
[03:54] changes that I made and deploys it to
[03:56] versal instance and I have 21 projects
[03:59] running on versal at the moment it gets
[04:01] over 50,000 visitors a month and I still
[04:04] pay $20 a month so overall pretty good
[04:07] really happy with versal and the
[04:08] Simplicity it's bringing and all my
[04:10] databases are hosted on mongod DB Atlas
[04:13] where I have over 21 clusters and most
[04:16] of them are m0o cluster which are free
[04:18] to monitor data to actually see what's
[04:20] going on in my apps I use a few Services
[04:23] first is plausible it's a simple script
[04:26] analytics that lets me track how many
[04:28] visitors are my my site and sometimes
[04:31] occasionally I will track events like
[04:33] did people click on that button or not
[04:34] it's costing me $29 per month at the
[04:37] moment which is surprisingly the most
[04:38] expensive part of my text te if I
[04:40] receive a customer email support and
[04:42] something goes wrong there's a bug that
[04:44] I don't know where it's coming from I
[04:45] will check the virtual deployment logs
[04:47] it's free to check the last 24 hours and
[04:50] it's usually when I catch the bug and
[04:51] for advanced monitoring things like
[04:53] split testing I would do it manually
[04:56] with the database I would store some
[04:58] kind of like integer in the database
[05:00] randomly and then just make the relevant
[05:02] query in the database see I don't let's
[05:04] say like the last 100 sign up customers
[05:06] filter them by their split test number
[05:09] and see which one purchased which one
[05:11] didn't I don't use any other services
[05:13] for that because I barely track any data
[05:15] and if I need to I would just use the
[05:17] raw mongodb queries and finally some of
[05:20] my products need specific features so
[05:22] for instance I would use AI models for
[05:24] products like logo fast where I help
[05:26] people generate logos or for Workbook
[05:28] PDF to help
[05:30] the help again people will generate
[05:32] workbook to learn a new language I use
[05:34] GPT for under the hood and I spend about
[05:36] $20 per month in open AI credit if I
[05:39] need any other cloud services I would go
[05:41] to Amazon web services the two most
[05:44] common that I use are awss 3 a big
[05:47] bucket where I can host images and this
[05:49] is what I use on Indie page where people
[05:51] upload pictures of their startups or
[05:53] their profile picture this is where the
[05:54] image would go and I also use from time
[05:56] to time AWS think cloud front it say CDN
[05:59] so images or videos load faster for
[06:02] things like a course for instance and a
[06:04] final touch it is not really part of a
[06:06] text tack but I hire a junior software
[06:09] engineer called GitHub co-pilots it cost
[06:11] me $10 per month and it's helping me
[06:14] code way faster I'll link to another
[06:16] video I made about how I turn on a
[06:18] startup ID into the first $1,000 in 4
[06:21] days using GitHub copilot when I learned
[06:23] how to code I remember struggling
[06:24] finding the perfect text tack but I wish
[06:26] I knew this text tack don't matter
[06:29] customer don't care about the visible
[06:31] what matters is that you pick one text
[06:32] Tack and you stick to it it's like a
[06:34] muscle the more you practice one rep the
[06:36] more comfortable you'll get with it and
[06:38] the faster you'll be able to do it and
[06:39] the faster you ship the faster you'll
[06:41] get customers all right that's the end
[06:42] of the video as always if you like the
[06:44] video you can like the video if you
[06:45] loved it you can subscribe to the
[06:46] Channel please also let me know in the
[06:48] comments if there are any topics you
[06:49] would like me to cover and until the
[06:50] next video just ship it cheers by the
[06:53] way I got someone to help me edit those
[06:54] videos so I can spend more time building
[06:56] apps please let me know what you think
[06:58] about the editing
