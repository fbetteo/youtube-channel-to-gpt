[00:36] quality sucked a little bit go live on
[00:39] Twitter
[00:40] too see how that goes Channel yesterday
[00:43] for some reason okay at least the sound

[00:48] time for the
[00:55] YouTube better
[00:58] quality check
[01:04] YouTube all
[01:07] right congrats hey yo

[01:20] all the messages okay they're
[01:23] here uh yes I am Live on YouTube the
[01:26] link is below the broadcast on Twitter
[01:29] uh the quality is normally better so
[01:31] check it out and not on Twitch yet I
[01:34] think I need to uh step up uh I'm not a
[01:37] streamer so I'm I'm learning as I
[01:42] go I think everything is is is
[01:47] working all right here we go um well
[01:50] hello everyone good morning it's uh
[01:53] 11:00 a.m. here in
[01:55] Bali and uh if you are coming from
[01:57] YouTube and you have no clue who I am my
[02:00] name is Mark I live here in Bali I build
[02:03] little internet
[02:06] businesses I have about 20 uh micro
[02:10] micro websites uh live now most of them
[02:13] are not making money some of them are
[02:14] making money and are paying the bills uh
[02:17] I've been building uh those startups or
[02:19] those websites in public on Twitter so I
[02:21] share um everything I learn everything I
[02:24] do everything I also earn uh there and
[02:28] I'm trying to um do the same for YouTube
[02:31] so having those live stream where I
[02:33] share what I do in a day and uh and see
[02:36] how that
[02:37] goes um those are all the little
[02:40] websites that I've made uh the reason
[02:43] why I'm doing this live stream now is
[02:45] because um among the six uh businesses
[02:48] that are making money um all of them are
[02:50] using stripe by the way and the two most
[02:53] common uh questions that I have on
[02:56] customer support is can I get an invoice
[02:59] uh usually this happens when people do
[03:01] their accountability by the end of the
[03:02] month and they uh didn't download the
[03:05] invoice they get when they made the
[03:06] payments and they forget it and then
[03:08] they would uh ask me by email uh so I
[03:11] would have to go to stripe I would have
[03:12] to find the right stripe account among
[03:14] my six uh stripe accounts uh find the
[03:16] customer download the invoice send it
[03:18] back to the customer which is uh a bit
[03:20] annoying and it's uh especially boring
[03:22] so uh I'm trying to automate that part
[03:25] by having one
[03:27] link you one having one link uh
[03:30] like this where customer can input the
[03:32] email retrieve the invoices edit those
[03:35] invoices and download them there's
[03:37] another part that's important um some
[03:40] people when they check out they don't
[03:42] know you will generate an invoice
[03:43] automatically with stripe checkout so
[03:45] they would NE they would not necessarily
[03:47] input their business details there and
[03:50] then they will later email me that says
[03:52] oh I forget to um I don't I my company
[03:54] details or whatever so I would have to
[03:56] go back to that striped um invoice I
[03:58] would have to download it screenshot it
[04:00] use Photoshop to change the customer
[04:03] details and then um take a um make the
[04:06] edits and send it back to the customer
[04:08] um again this is quite boring um not
[04:11] everybody has this problem but as a
[04:13] stripe account owner I found this very
[04:15] annoying and so this is it we're going
[04:18] to be building uh Zenvo I already bought
[04:21] the domain name and this is what we're
[04:23] going to be working on today um as a
[04:26] final part I am um working so so I do
[04:30] everything from the coding to the
[04:32] marketing to the brainstorming to
[04:34] sometimes the psychiatrist or whatever
[04:35] oh I have friends for that but um
[04:38] nothing is perfect uh there might be
[04:41] some bugs um it's not the best um
[04:44] marketing I'm not the best at writing
[04:45] headlines I'm just trying to do a little
[04:47] bit of everything and ship those
[04:49] startups um so I'm not very ambitious I
[04:53] have no intention to build a unicorn my
[04:55] goal is to keep building those apps
[04:57] having fun building them launching them
[04:59] and then um either moving on or adding
[05:01] features if if you know users are
[05:03] interested in um that's pretty much it
[05:05] so no much ambition just uh sharing my
[05:07] code and we are going to get this live
[05:10] stream up and running until the product
[05:12] is done uh so that includes um finishing
[05:15] the
[05:16] product that include making a ling page
[05:19] doing the copywriting The Branding the
[05:21] colors um pretty much getting everything
[05:23] ready before the product hunt
[05:26] launch
[05:27] um as a final yeah okay uh we yesterday
[05:32] we went stream it was a bit chaotic some
[05:34] people try to sneak into my garden and
[05:36] steal my trees so we're back today
[05:38] hopefully this is going to be more uh
[05:41] peaceful and calm um what we what what
[05:44] we did yesterday we have uh set up a
[05:46] user dashboard so this is a private
[05:48] dashboard where I'm connected I'm
[05:51] authenticated I can uh as a user I can
[05:54] add stripe accounts here so I add um I
[05:58] get restricted API Keys um if you don't
[06:00] know what are those there's pretty sick
[06:03] uh these are stripe API keys but with
[06:05] restricted permissions and so users of
[06:09] my app could say oh I give you access to
[06:11] this specific uh object but not that one
[06:14] and then they can create a key an API
[06:16] key and that would let me do some uh
[06:19] operation on their behalf on their STP
[06:21] account without giving me the full
[06:23] permission this is much safer than
[06:26] sharing API keys and this is what we're
[06:29] going to be using because when people
[06:30] get a link from oh yeah of course you're
[06:33] not seeing my stream I'm still not a
[06:35] streamer
[06:38] so here we go okay now you can see this
[06:41] the yeah I guess you can see this the
[06:43] screen
[06:44] okay okay so I was talking for uh I was
[06:48] talking about what we've built yesterday
[06:50] so uh it was a short stream uh we have
[06:53] this private dashboard people are logged
[06:55] in uh they log in with email they can
[06:57] add their strip accounts they just pass
[06:59] their restricted stripe API key here and
[07:02] that will create um a special link for
[07:05] them
[07:08] here that's it yep um they will have a
[07:12] special link here that they can share
[07:13] with the customers when the customer
[07:15] inputs their emails um is going to query
[07:18] all the stripe uh accounts the user has
[07:21] and search for customers under that
[07:24] email and then it's going to display all
[07:26] the invoices the
[07:27] customer had under their email uh with a
[07:31] link to download the
[07:34] invoice Yep this is finally working uh
[07:37] this is the stripe hosted invoice
[07:40] link and um the second part we want to
[07:43] do is to let people update those
[07:46] invoices uh the details so now I'm going
[07:48] to focus on the part where I I I will
[07:53] have some kind of like invoice editor
[07:55] I'm going to get all the invoice details
[07:57] and let the people change some details
[07:59] of them like for instance their uh home
[08:02] their home address their business
[08:03] details or any of that and then it will
[08:05] be able to redownload the invoice and
[08:07] have an updated
[08:08] invoice
[08:10] um yeah I think that's pretty much it
[08:13] uh let me think yes so this is day two
[08:16] of the Stream So This is the really
[08:17] beginning uh this looks really ugly as
[08:20] you can see there is no it's not
[08:21] responsive it's not beautiful there is
[08:23] no themes um this is just the
[08:26] raw data I'm going to finish the product
[08:28] first
[08:29] and then we're going to do a little bit
[08:31] of branding change the phones do the
[08:32] copy do the landing page and all that
[08:37] things to make sure that everything is
[08:39] working
[08:42] here okay
[08:48] nice
[08:50] question yeah um if so if you guys are
[08:53] on Twitter um check out the YouTube link
[08:55] below I think uh the quality is much
[08:58] better there I have no idea why Twitter
[09:00] is not that good but yesterday it was
[09:03] recurring thing so check out the YouTube
[09:11] instead all right I'm just double-
[09:14] checking on my phone that uh because
[09:17] that happened that I was streaming for
[09:18] like one hour and I realized that I was
[09:20] not streaming the right screen so I'm
[09:22] just checking making
[09:24] sure
[09:27] okay this is this is uh meia I think so
[09:31] we're good okay um right if there's
[09:35] anything let me know in the chat the
[09:36] sound the quality uh I cannot do much
[09:38] for Twitter I think it's uh it has to do
[09:41] with their
[09:42] API check check the YouTube link below
[09:45] it should be much
[09:47] better nice
[09:56] okay okay
[10:01] go so
[10:06] um let's get back at it so yeserday so
[10:10] we have this we we have uh stripe
[10:12] account that are connected to the user
[10:15] dashboard um and we
[10:18] want we want we want people when they
[10:21] input their emails we want them to be
[10:22] able to edit those invoices so this is a
[10:25] data straight from
[10:27] stripe um I'm I'm going to have to
[10:29] recreate some kind of like invoice
[10:33] editor I think I will have to
[10:38] actually I will have to recreate this
[10:41] page with HTML like a display to the
[10:44] user have this place here where people
[10:47] can it will be a text area or input or
[10:49] whatever where people
[10:51] can what is going on oh okay it opens my
[10:54] mail okay um these place here will be
[10:58] editable
[10:59] so that people can change their names um
[11:02] everything and this will not change this
[11:05] will not change as well this will also
[11:08] not change so yeah basically recreate
[11:11] this page have this part here as a
[11:15] editable
[11:16] form and then I think I'm going to use a
[11:19] canva HTML canva and turn that canva
[11:23] into a screenshot I think this is let's
[11:28] see what we get HTML 2
[11:37] PDF there has to be an MPN
[11:41] package
[11:49] node
[11:55] see yeah that's going to be tricky I
[11:58] think I think I might have to go with an
[12:08] image you guys have any any clue on how
[12:13] I will be able to I should be able to
[12:15] turn let's say whatever this HTML thing
[12:18] into a
[12:19] PDF um if there's a nice way to do it
[12:22] otherwise I think I just going to make a
[12:24] screenshot like a PNG screenshot oh
[12:27] maybe this
[12:56] right he's not so good I don't know if
[12:58] you can do something about yeah the man
[13:00] the quality I have no idea
[13:02] it's I think
[13:08] Twitter yeah the quality on Twitter is
[13:10] not really good um yeah guys go I think
[13:15] go there's a YouTube link below go on
[13:18] YouTube I think it's for some reason
[13:21] it's just so much
[13:27] better
[13:33] yeah it's so much better on
[13:37] YouTube let's tag Elon Musk and ask what
[13:41] the what the heck is going on with uh
[13:44] Twitter live
[13:47] streams it's probably the Mad scientists
[13:49] here that make the live stream bandwidth
[13:51] go
[13:54] wrong okay um right let's recreate
[13:57] stripe invoices now
[14:01] so I think
[14:05] um okay this is it we're going to make
[14:08] this a
[14:16] small
[14:19] neutral my server is still running it
[14:26] is okay none of the invoice and here so
[14:30] I think we will need to have a mo some
[14:32] kind of
[14:40] model let's see if I want to edit the
[14:43] invoice I pop up a model have some input
[14:46] forms in
[14:56] it
[14:57] okay
[15:12] right let's try let's try this so we
[15:14] have these button we're going to have
[15:15] another which is edit oh yeah we're
[15:18] going to be using some
[15:22] icons um this for download oh maybe mini
[15:27] ones
[15:31] oh they have Micro
[15:33] now
[15:38] sick okay why not and then
[15:57] edit
[16:05] okay we have those
[16:08] buttons and I think this
[16:12] will uh here we're going to say edit
[16:24] invo so yeah we'll need to have a model
[16:27] somewhere
[16:43] invoice to
[16:46] edit right and when we going to put the
[16:49] invoice number into this this is going
[16:52] to show a
[16:54] model
[16:57] yeah
[17:16] yes oh well I think I'll need I'll get
[17:21] uh finished my stripe if I keep calling
[17:23] their API just to test I'll have to
[17:27] download the data and
[17:31] where is
[17:33] it yeah console like
[17:57] this give me that
[18:01] copy and we are going to put this in
[18:04] here so we don't have to carry the
[18:07] stripe API every single
[18:11] time is it going to work yes it's
[18:13] working I
[18:14] think okay it is working so we have a
[18:17] couple
[18:21] of doesn't
[18:24] matter okay we have a couple of invoices
[18:27] pre
[18:35] finded
[18:42] okay we have going to have to create a
[18:44] model
[18:50] somewhere so I'm going to be reusing
[18:52] some of the code
[18:54] a from that
[18:57] component
[19:09] oops and here we're going to do
[19:11] something like if uh
[19:16] okay invoice to edit yep and here we
[19:23] go when we close the model we want to do
[19:26] set invoice to edits to
[19:31] no same here set invoice
[19:35] toedit so uh well actually we don't need
[19:38] that so
[19:40] perfect we need to do show
[19:44] when give me something
[19:47] copilot that invoice
[19:51] no
[19:55] work uh maybe
[19:59] this
[20:06] oh
[20:12] um appear appear show how do I show
[20:17] it I'm going to do something
[20:24] dirty it true or
[20:27] false
[20:28] for some reason I don't remember how
[20:31] to do that nope still oh okay yeah yeah
[20:35] invoice to
[20:36] edit yep
[20:39] okay and
[20:45] here and boom okay and we have the model
[20:51] now
[20:55] okay
[20:57] um
[21:07] I think this is
[21:09] a 16 by9
[21:12] invoice see how many pixels are
[21:20] there
[21:22] 566
[21:25] 34 34 56
[21:32] six oh this is
[21:43] not we're going to find the ratio of
[21:45] stripe invoices so I recreate the same
[21:48] ones okay
[21:51] interesting oh I think it's
[21:54] A4
[21:56] a A4

[32:20] okay
[32:21] uh okay we want to have those two things
[32:25] we going to have a div
[32:31] let's define
[32:41] between
[32:44] invo and we're going to have so this is
[32:47] going to be say invoice and here we're
[32:50] going to
[32:51] have I think it's called
[32:54] invoice. account name probably
[33:01] we don't have the invoice oh okay yeah
[33:02] invoice select
[33:12] it selected what was it how did you call
[33:15] it invoice details invoice to edit okay
[33:18] do account
[33:22] name what do we
[33:25] have okay this is
[33:29] it oh I think well actually I think I
[33:32] don't need to prefill this I can just
[33:35] give this
[33:38] thing
[33:39] [Music]
[33:41] to
[33:45] here
[33:46] uh wait we going to give this here okay
[33:49] so we have something prefilled
[33:55] okay
[33:59] this is oh this
[34:02] is um
[34:04] this uh I think this this is going to be
[34:07] a separate startup um if there is
[34:10] anything new like any new component that
[34:12] I create for these maybe like let's say
[34:15] some cool components for the lending
[34:17] page uh I would add those components to
[34:19] ship fast but this very specific thing
[34:23] about uh creating special links for
[34:25] people to download their invoices they
[34:27] will be a separate
[34:32] startup Voice new Voice number
[34:39] okay
[34:46] issue I think this is will be invoice to
[34:50] edit
[34:52] that
[34:55] probably what is it yeah looks like
[34:58] it looks too beautiful to be true oh
[35:00] that was
[35:02] it date of
[35:06] issue where is that thing
[35:12] rated do add effective
[35:17] ads here there are so many
[35:23] variables Web book delivered ads
[35:33] here's how many sales you had for the
[35:35] ship b um it's on it's on the website
[35:38] just go uh there's a link in the
[35:40] description just go there and the
[35:43] counter refreshes every hours so you
[35:45] will see exactly how many
[35:49] customers just
[35:51] transition made
[35:53] at date of issue so I think that's the
[35:56] creative
[36:01] date created
[36:25] okay
[36:35] okay we're going to what is this S2
[36:39] things sping
[36:40] top
[36:43] 17 what did you do
[36:47] CH what is that thing this is pretty
[36:51] bad why have pting left and all
[36:55] that all right maybe maybe actually we
[36:58] didn't we shouldn't have give this to
[37:13] CH view
[37:19] date date
[37:25] you
[37:30] is
[37:39] it du date there we
[37:44] go damn this is going to be
[37:51] long okay now we have information about
[37:53] the
[37:54] business so let's see we have a section
[37:58] here you're going to do something like
[38:00] this maybe space
[38:04] y
[38:06] four give it a little space um we have
[38:10] this thing then we have
[38:13] this
[38:17] here
[38:20] okay then we have uh information okay
[38:23] there will be two sections here one will
[38:25] be editable so first the business
[38:30] information we have so we have two
[38:35] sections I think this will be a greed
[38:38] greed calls
[38:40] two the first one will be business
[38:46] data so we're going to reuse the
[38:49] accounts
[38:50] name and then the phone number and the
[38:53] email if it
[38:55] exists
[38:58] phone
[39:01] number
[39:04] nope uh
[39:18] country oh maybe well actually I gave
[39:21] co-pilots so show
[39:24] the account number maybe it
[39:28] knows country no not phone
[39:36] number
[39:41] no where's my phone number
[39:47] 747 [ __ ] where is
[39:51] it oh maybe that's not part maybe that's
[39:55] not on the invoice okay that information
[39:57] here it's probably not on the
[40:15] invoice okay I know okay so we need to
[40:18] fetch some Data Business Like stripe
[40:21] account
[40:23] data which means in the API call instead
[40:26] of just returning the invoices we should
[40:29] also
[40:30] return some of the data from the strip
[40:32] account I know it's it sounds tricky now
[40:35] but it w make sense so strip account SP
[40:38] user ID for each strip
[40:40] account invoice push we are going
[40:45] to for each rep
[40:55] account
[41:07] for
[41:09] each
[41:25] noise
[41:32] okay so for this and we're going to
[41:38] say try account and here I'm going to
[41:43] give it account. extra so this is coming
[41:47] straight from when the people added
[41:51] their business the St
[41:54] businesses which fch the colors the
[41:57] support
[42:01] email
[42:24] okay okay deci stop Revenue sharing for
[42:27] IND page is
[42:28] n yeah um I
[42:31] didn't um my Indie page is not working
[42:33] right now because I'm transiting from my
[42:36] previous strip account that are
[42:38] registered in France where I pay uh
[42:42] 24% taxes on Revenue I think this is
[42:47] yeah Revenue income yeah 24% taxes on
[42:50] revenue and um I'm transiting to a new
[42:53] country so I had to set up stop all all
[42:56] my STP accounts in France uh cuz I
[42:58] closed my business there and I'm doing
[43:00] the transition now which is uh
[43:02] timeconsuming boring but I still have to
[43:05] do it and so I will reconnect my Indie
[43:07] page as soon as this uh this is done
[43:10] because now I have basically two strip
[43:12] accounts for each of the startups that
[43:14] you can see on my Indie
[43:17] page support
[43:20] email
[43:23] see rep account extra
[43:34] maybe go back to
[43:55] it
[44:03] [ __ ] I don't know I don't know where I
[44:05] am supposed to
[44:07] be oh wa
[44:09] here CL this and we are going to console
[44:22] log see we got
[44:25] something
[44:27] normally I should get some more
[44:29] information about the business
[44:31] now strap accounts okay and we have at
[44:34] least we have the primary color so it's
[44:36] because it's a test mode account there's
[44:39] no there's not there are not many
[44:42] information for now but in live mode I
[44:46] should have the support the business
[44:48] support email and all those information
[44:50] that we will
[44:52] need going back to this
[45:01] here account name TR account
[45:08] dot it's called I think call
[45:13] it support extra support
[45:16] [Music]
[45:22] email oh and then also one thing
[45:27] there should
[45:29] be where is
[45:50] it think and then we need to add the
[45:54] style of the Border
[45:57] I think it
[46:01] is
[46:06] primary okay so we replicate the that
[46:09] little thing from
[46:11] stripe so it looks legit
[46:16] okay
[46:24] voice
[46:52] support maybe we need to get also the
[46:54] support number
[46:56] try
[46:59] account
[47:06] API this type company we don't care
[47:12] email what's the name of it business
[47:15] Prof um okay business profile this is
[47:18] what we
[47:24] want and we
[47:26] oh wow you can't get the annual
[47:29] revenue okay you didn't know that once
[47:33] the estimated
[47:36] Revenue only accepted for press
[47:39] okay support email support phone there
[47:41] we
[47:49] go SHP account and here we're going to
[47:51] add a new field for that called
[48:00] support restart
[48:03] server that should be populated when we
[48:06] go
[48:08] live events page support email and here
[48:13] [Music]
[48:14] support now it's going to be
[48:16] empty going back at this
[48:20] invoice this is the information we have
[48:22] about the
[48:24] business um now we need to have this
[48:27] build
[48:42] to and here I think we're going to have
[48:45] a big text area or something I'll have
[48:47] to see later how we do this but this is
[48:50] pretty much where people will input
[48:53] their customer email and everything so
[48:55] so for now we're going to leave it empty
[48:57] I'm just going to leave a
[49:01] placeholder customer
[49:03] [Music]
[49:24] email
[49:34] refresh all right yeah this is what this
[49:37] is this is going to be the editable form
[49:40] might be couple maybe we don't want
[49:42] people to edit their email maybe just
[49:44] their
[49:46] address we we see that later so probably
[49:50] something
[49:54] like
[50:00] address
[50:03] maybe multiple
[50:07] things City
[50:10] Country let's just type
[50:18] one there's
[50:23] nothing I might have
[50:26] messed
[50:34] up okay the city is
[50:37] new just the country for
[50:43] now
[50:45] okay next part
[50:50] um is it why this one is due I think was
[50:54] it paid
[50:56] right I'm going to have to fetch some
[50:58] data
[51:02] here what is this
[51:12] status made
[51:18] okay maybe maybe we can update that
[51:21] because that's kind of strange that it
[51:23] says due and not paid and he has a link
[51:28] to pay online amount due it doesn't say
[51:31] paid
[51:37] anywhere maybe I just a new with
[51:39] invoices I'm missing out something so
[51:43] here we want to have a little badge uh
[51:47] near the amount that
[51:51] says
[51:53] invoice do
[51:59] status stus and we are going to give
[52:02] this a badge
[52:07] badge see how that
[52:10] goes okay this is
[52:20] it yeah okay so back to the invoice here
[52:30] um now we need to display
[52:35] that this is a big
[52:37] line
[52:42] with where does that
[52:46] goes invoice paid okay download receip
[52:50] download
[52:54] invoice
[52:57] I have no clue what's the difference
[52:59] between those
[53:05] two STP
[53:11] shows okay there is a payment
[53:14] method it's roughly the same
[53:18] okay okay so we need due date we're
[53:23] going to replicate so the here there
[53:25] will be
[53:37] line
[53:41] yes is it
[53:43] working
[53:45] sweet due date okay this is good invoice
[53:50] du
[53:52] date perfect um and now we're going to
[53:56] recreate this little table
[53:59] here think I'll be using
[54:03] so okay I think there could be multiple
[54:06] items
[54:10] here sub
[54:13] total
[54:22] total uh where could that be is it
[54:26] line
[54:37] thing no give it to
[54:54] me
[54:56] L me
[55:10] this are your thoughts in Mark are your
[55:12] thoughts in English or in French man
[55:14] this is weird
[55:16] it's I sometime because I lived abroad
[55:19] for a while now and most of my friends
[55:21] are American my wife is Korean so
[55:24] English is the language I speak most of
[55:26] the time even though I'm not good at it
[55:28] but it became somehow like one unified
[55:31] language like French and English would
[55:34] become just one thing and is so weird
[55:37] and sometimes I would start thinking in
[55:39] my head in English and and I would
[55:40] transition to friends this is really
[55:43] this is really
[55:54] strange
[56:07] okay now we have it
[56:13] data okay this is it we are going to
[56:15] display all the lines the
[56:19] data and need to show name quantity unit
[56:24] price an
[56:26] amount so description is here quantity
[56:31] should
[56:34] be quty
[56:38] here
[56:45] okay back to Daisy
[56:51] UI
[56:53] e
[56:55] and Yep this is what we
[57:00] want we don't want to overflow though CU
[57:04] we're getting to screenshot that
[57:06] thing
[57:23] so
[57:37] think we can remove all
[57:53] that
[58:09] here go back description quantity unit
[58:13] price
[58:23] amount
[58:26] unit unit
[58:28] [Music]
[58:29] price
[58:32] amount
[58:34] okay this should be
[58:37] good
[58:41] and
[58:44] here for
[58:53] each
[58:57] oh oh
[59:00] boy oh my God I love copot when it does
[59:02] this kind of things
[59:05] holy this is exactly what I
[59:11] wanted very sweet
[59:15] um do we
[59:17] have uh the description okay the
[59:19] quantity
[59:21] okay the price unit amount
[59:25] I think this is it
[59:29] yeah this is so
[59:33] nice Okay
[59:36] um and
[59:38] then we have this
[59:44] thing sub
[59:47] total
[59:49] discounts total amount do
[59:53] okay we have the table
[59:57] here where
[60:05] table
[60:10] so think as they do it it looks like
[60:14] it's a a
[60:20] GRE
[60:22] yeah is a greed read calls
[60:27] to the first one is empty and the second
[60:31] one I think it has a
[60:34] divide
[60:38] Y
[60:40] and sub
[60:42] total discounts total
[60:53] am
[61:04] this uh live stream should be called I
[61:06] let copilot right make my new
[61:14] startup give me some
[61:23] magic
[61:29] no might not
[61:36] work probably
[61:41] not is okay you're giving me the
[61:44] download invoice button no no no don't
[61:46] go too far this is for another
[61:53] day
[61:55] okay what do we have so
[61:57] yeah
[62:00] these sub total
[62:03] total oh yeah okay so these there should
[62:17] be we get something better here sub
[62:19] total discount no
[62:22] total do
[62:25] not bad not
[62:32] bad
[62:38] okay
[62:39] nope yeah we want to replace all those
[62:42] with this one
[62:53] two
[62:56] this should go
[62:58] here okay that looks like a little bit
[63:01] more as a stripe thing I think it didn't
[63:05] understand the
[63:07] discount um let's see what we got here
[63:14] discounts give me
[63:23] data
[63:29] okay okay we have the discount here
[63:32] which is an
[63:35] object so we need to
[63:41] show probably there need to be a minus
[63:44] sign
[63:45] somewhere
[63:50] yeah and we
[63:53] need
[63:59] discount
[64:01] coupons
[64:04] in
[64:10] discount discount
[64:12] C amount
[64:18] of uh okay
[64:21] although if there are no discount
[64:24] so I think invoice toit the discount
[64:27] that if there are no discount I think we
[64:32] should not show
[64:37] that just in case that would look like
[64:42] this
[64:45] okay okay good we are almost
[64:49] done okay they show the currency here
[64:52] let's let's do it
[65:05] let
[65:10] uppercase
[65:13] okay yeah if there are
[65:17] any extra information to add in the
[65:20] footer I think it's somewhere here yeah
[65:22] footer here we want to display it it's
[65:26] going to be
[65:29] total
[65:34] tter oh I think we need to make sure if
[65:38] there is a
[65:50] footer that will be for another day
[66:06] okay I think there could be other stuff
[66:08] there they could be headers or
[66:10] something
[66:17] forgot
[66:23] robino
[66:26] okay I think it's no not a big deal
[66:53] here
[67:20] okay and then finally the little the
[67:23] real food
[67:25] not the user generated
[67:28] one border border
[67:38] up or is it going to be
[67:52] um
[67:55] give me some
[67:56] magic you're almost
[68:00] there here we go boy is it is that
[68:04] it almost let see we want to make this
[68:09] upper
[68:19] case all right I think this is
[68:22] itate okay
[68:26] all right I think the invoice structure
[68:29] is
[68:31] done now we probably need
[68:35] to yeah we need the
[68:37] styling so we are going to go back
[68:47] there to
[68:52] export
[68:58] going to be a light
[69:03] theme invoices um big
[69:08] big this is going to be text
[69:12] Exel no where is
[69:16] it text
[69:19] XEL on
[69:22] Bold
[69:26] and here I
[69:29] think it should
[69:31] be plus six
[69:35] gray 700
[69:42] maybe and also the background here is
[69:45] actually
[69:52] White
[69:55] here we can see think I'm going to have
[69:57] to change this later but yeah this is
[70:00] pretty much it so invoice she Fest
[70:05] okay think we'll need a pading
[70:10] of
[70:14] eight order top eight that's
[70:19] good a y I think we're going to be six
[70:25] better um then the text here I think
[70:28] it's
[70:31] medium looks like medium
[70:43] text
[70:52] actually
[70:56] we can do a little more no no okay no
[71:10] one oh okay I see what you did here
[71:14] those are two separate
[71:21] columns yeah
[71:28] so we have class greed GRE calls
[71:52] to
[71:56] [Music]
[72:04] isue yep and
[72:07] finally
[72:12] you in
[72:19] here
[72:22] okay this should be maybe we'll have a
[72:25] little bit of
[72:27] a um B maybe we want some g y 2
[72:35] one just a
[72:46] little yeah
[72:50] okay
[72:52] then
[72:54] last
[72:56] pH think this look
[73:04] like okay B so my B I
[73:22] think
[73:35] and B two should be
[73:40] also
[73:44] okay description un need amount this is
[73:49] okay sh as welll okay okay okay
[73:53] then we have the subtotal amount
[74:01] due
[74:08] so this here should be leading relaxed I
[74:14] guess
[74:22] right
[74:48] we put this should we should should we
[74:52] maybe
[74:54] how does it look on a bigger
[75:00] screen yeah I think we should make this
[75:02] phon a little bit smaller like just like
[75:11] strip
[75:20] okay the
[75:22] total
[75:52] here
[76:00] we do that prob we should
[76:14] do what do I
[76:20] done oh
[76:22] no
[76:31] here
[76:35] okay next area should
[76:38] be now we're going to say
[76:47] um this is going to be
[76:52] editable
[76:57] here and
[77:00] then yeah the
[77:03] footer is I think it exist we need to
[77:06] give it some extra margin at the
[77:10] top
[77:12] six and
[77:17] finally this should
[77:22] go they should go at the very bottom of
[77:26] oh we'll need to change the entire lay
[77:27] layout of the page I guess to give it
[77:31] a whatever 1.2 ratio aspect
[77:47] ratio here I think it's a text
[77:50] XS text great
[78:00] this probably what it is
[78:11] yep I
[78:13] think next
[78:21] grade
[78:25] right I think we have an invoice
[78:28] here
[78:30] we
[78:32] replicated a stripe
[78:35] invoice need to for to finish the layout
[78:38] but this
[78:39] is this is a stripe
[78:44] invoice
[78:47] um
[78:48] [Music]
[78:51] see what was the first programming
[78:54] language that you
[78:56] learned man uh it's a
[78:59] long Dreadful story but I learn I unique
[79:04] I think they still exist yeah they still
[79:06] exist but they changed their framework I
[79:09] learned
[79:10] this as my first language and I didn't
[79:13] know how the web work how Javas script
[79:17] Works how web pages or HTML or react
[79:21] works and I jumps straight into ionic
[79:24] and I had no clue what I was doing I was
[79:27] just Gathering components and trying to
[79:30] make an app with it it was a disaster I
[79:32] spent a year on something that nobody
[79:34] ever saw nobody ever used and the app
[79:36] was not even working by the end and then
[79:39] I made another mistake by learning react
[79:42] native as my second language without
[79:44] knowing JavaScript and I spent another
[79:47] six month on something that was another
[79:49] total disaster and finally I realized
[79:52] that you started first to understand the
[79:54] foundation how HTML and web pages work
[79:58] and then JavaScript and then you had um
[80:01] component library on top of AIDS and
[80:03] framework and so I restarted learning
[80:06] from scratch after probably two
[80:08] years and and here we are today but yeah
[80:11] it was it was a pretty much of a
[80:15] disaster hello good morning from Ubud
[80:21] neighbors Do you have a job as a
[80:23] developer uh I don't have a job as a de
[80:26] I had for six month a job as as a
[80:29] software engineer developer I I worked
[80:31] actually for with the Lopez maybe some
[80:36] of you know him this uh gentleman here I
[80:41] spent six months working for him I
[80:42] didn't know I would actually work for
[80:44] him uh I applied for a software engineer
[80:47] job when I was not at the best time in
[80:49] my life I wanted to do something
[80:51] different I had failed entrepreneurship
[80:52] for for like 3 or 4 years before I was
[80:55] like a I got to change I got to do
[80:56] something new I applied for that company
[80:59] and at the end they the HR asked me if I
[81:02] wanted to pass on a message to Ty Lopez
[81:05] and I was puzzled because I knew him
[81:07] from his YouTube video the Lamborghini
[81:09] video that I had no clue I was applying
[81:12] for his company and then I ended up
[81:15] getting the job uh working for him for
[81:17] like five or six month and I got fired
[81:20] uh later on and then I jump straight
[81:24] back into an um solo
[81:30] prorip old are you I am I turned 30 last
[81:37] year that's scammer yeah he has bad not
[81:41] really good
[81:43] reputation I also didn't have a good
[81:45] impression of
[81:47] him and he's not the kind of person I
[81:50] want to have you know in my house uh
[81:53] every day but he
[81:58] much is is very smart you can tell he's
[82:00] a really smart dude he knows what he's
[82:03] doing he's not just pure luck or
[82:05] Randomness he knows exactly what he's
[82:07] doing and
[82:10] he's I don't know I had mixed feelings
[82:13] before and I liked him more after
[82:14] working for him if that makes any sense
[82:17] but still not the kind of person I want
[82:18] to be friend
[82:21] with
[82:24] I think he's still around I don't know
[82:26] if he's how big is he has pretty big
[82:29] YouTube
[82:31] channel people
[82:34] change that's pretty fun hello ex
[82:41] employer all right so we have a strap
[82:43] invoice here I need to clear the
[82:45] formatting um but we need to get rid of
[82:48] the padding
[82:50] around we probably we need to get rid of
[82:58] this yep we probably don't want to Mo
[83:02] this
[83:06] rounded and I think we need a literally
[83:09] zero petting
[83:21] yeah all wait we need to make this
[83:23] button sit at the
[83:26] top
[83:28] so this here should be fixed top four
[83:34] right
[83:42] four we don't need any
[83:46] title uh we going to make this think
[83:49] we're going to make it a button button
[83:51] neutral
[83:53] people know there is a way to K to close
[83:57] that make a
[84:00] button do a look on
[84:04] desktop it's ugly
[84:07] yep it fixed but it's looks like it's
[84:12] what is the difference absolute and
[84:13] fixed why is not that thing on the top
[84:19] right I'll fix it I need first to fix
[84:23] the layout
[84:26] um we need so max width I think we need
[84:30] an aspect ratio
[84:35] somewhere yep
[84:38] okay
[84:46] um how are we going to do that so max
[84:49] with 3 XL these look like
[84:53] like uh it enough SP no maybe we give it
[84:57] 4 XL 5 XL
[84:59] maybe all
[85:05] right well actually do we care about the
[85:08] format of the invoice no we don't really
[85:09] care about
[85:13] that we just
[85:18] want yeah we don't care about the format
[85:20] of the invoice yeah doesn't matter as
[85:21] long as oh maybe they need no we don't
[85:24] care no as long as it's clean it's okay
[85:28] so we probably won't
[85:31] to have some spacing here oh yeah
[85:51] nothing4
[85:53] just want to add a little divider
[85:55] somewhere so maybe it's a bit too
[86:12] much so maybe we don't need to go also
[86:14] that's Max
[86:16] width make it a little bit
[86:21] shorter
[86:30] okay
[86:33] uh maybe we want to give it full
[86:41] height oh
[86:44] yeah because we are in a flex
[86:47] container I think
[86:51] mean
[86:53] damn I forgot you guys remember how to I
[86:57] am in a flex
[86:58] container let me try to show my screen a
[87:00] bit

[87:16] container and I want this thing here the
[87:20] only elements inside of it to be full

[91:13] absolutely
[91:19] uh just don't I I don't know I I just
[91:21] just wish I could keep the code like
[91:23] this and I know it's a little thing
[91:24] about the
[91:28] flex just a tiny thing I think it's
[91:41] stretch made a
[91:50] tweet
[92:01] one regular videos actually this is I'm
[92:04] actually I'm still using a green screen
[92:06] for this
[92:07] one as you can
[92:10] see uh on the planet
[92:16] Marth yeah no this is yeah this is uncut
[92:19] it
[92:20] no
[92:22] no reflection no script just pure uh
[92:25] coding and I'm not really good at
[92:27] thinking and cutting at the same time so
[92:28] I'm pretty slow at the
[92:33] moment
[92:35] [ __ ] try something
[92:48] else invoice
[92:50] number
[93:35] going to be
[93:50] shooting
[94:24] [Music]
[94:28] you nice 5 a Maro time man I want to go
[94:31] Maro so
[94:33] bad guys have the best waves in Europe I
[94:37] think and probably the delicious
[94:46] food hello Philip congrats for your uh
[94:51] your latest backlink product M so so
[94:54] good to see
[95:19] that square
[95:40] maybe just drink something
[95:46] out overflow visible and we want to show
[95:50] the Overflow here
[96:00] um right I think I'm lost so I'm going
[96:02] to use the
[96:03] typical CSS uh
[96:09] fix
[96:14] okay you want to do something else then
[96:20] 0
[96:23] we want to do
[96:25] this
[96:28] uh
[96:32] probably
[96:37] um
[96:46] think this is not the correct X ratio
[96:49] isn't it
[96:56] ratio how big is that oh actually know
[97:00] that was
[97:02] correct
[97:20] wait
[97:24] I'm a bit puzzled
[97:50] here
[97:58] what have I done what have you done
[98:20] Mike
[98:51] could this
[98:57] be oh yeah Fed Up the
[99:20] ratio
[99:44] she
[99:50] couldn't
[100:08] all right that should be
[100:19] enough
[100:37] and yes okay probably we need
[100:40] to do something like
[100:49] this get six
[100:54] okay and this thing at the
[101:01] bottom where is
[101:03] it Mr footer yeah this you should be
[101:06] margin Top
[101:08] Auto so you really sit at the bottom
[101:11] nope oh yeah I need to make you hide
[101:19] full
[101:25] background
[101:37] gray you should be full
[101:49] height
[101:53] okay
[101:55] um this thing here should be display
[102:19] somewhere okay here we
[102:29] go okay we have a tribe
[102:33] invoice
[102:37] op is it crawlable yeah it is crawlable
[102:40] but there's something really strange
[102:48] here uh oh yeah had four
[102:52] oh
[102:53] yeah yeah the formatting here
[103:08] um think this should be
[103:15] hidden it should be hidden
[103:19] too and probably
[103:28] overflow yes
[103:31] okay so we can scroll the invoice until
[103:33] the
[103:40] bottom or maybe
[103:42] [Music]
[103:48] overflow oh yeah okay this this is the
[103:51] proper way of doing it
[103:53] nice okay see if that works okay still
[103:57] working so this is a copy of a strip
[103:59] invoice now we need to fix the form
[104:01] users should input their details
[104:05] here um yeah also I think this is a bit
[104:08] off I need to fix
[104:10] that it should look like
[104:16] this so
[104:18] read next yeah it should be a flex okay

[114:36] currency it looks like it don't mind
[114:38] anymore I have a nasty error though
[114:42] default value oh yeah because of the
[114:43] text area okay but this will be an easy
[114:45] fix
[114:48] after
[114:50] okay so we have we can close that we
[114:53] have our invoices we can edit them um I
[114:56] think we want to be able to okay we need
[114:58] to make the download
[115:00] button uh what was I using for logo
[115:06] Fest
[115:09] right first logo
[115:13] first it tools logo fast
[115:17] yep we are using
[115:23] let me check the
[115:30] packagea um oh HTML to image I
[115:38] think yeah let's try that
[115:48] thing um
[115:57] probably need you ref yep input ref what
[116:02] is
[116:02] that oh yeah input ref okay and here we
[116:05] going to have a invoice
[116:09] ref

[116:13] to
[116:18] download here we will give it the ref of
[116:21] invoice
[116:24] ref so in those
[116:28] buttons we have a second button here um
[116:32] the name of it hero
[116:35] icons we going to search a download
[116:39] button go it
[116:47] here uh this is not a square button it's
[116:50] going to be just a regular
[117:01] one four and I think this should be a
[117:04] primary
[117:10] button the best UI ever for now this
[117:15] will do the work um so here we say
[117:18] download in
[117:23] invoice maybe we're going to say

[133:37] a HTML to PDF Library if you do I would
[133:41] love to
[133:46] trade
[134:01] you think you headlights brother before
[134:04] you control di
[134:08] mission that would be
[134:14] nice that'll be nice
[134:16] um
[134:23] that'll be nice but that would take a
[134:24] lot of time I
[134:29] think yeah and headless Brothers on
[134:31] nextjs are pretty tricky to
[134:44] handle all right need to understand what
[134:47] is going on here
[135:01] here logo Fest
[135:06] maybe where is the code that I used to
[135:10] have
[135:16] um
[135:22] I'm just going to leave it as it
[135:25] is all right I'm going to leave it here
[135:46] okay
[136:31] all right K yeah if you have a better
[136:33] solution I would love to give it a try
[136:36] and team W react PDF HTML okay
[136:39] man react PDF HTML
[136:45] react let's see what we get here
[136:53] [Music]
[136:59] HML I can give it a try
[137:12] um rect
[137:15] compies oh okay
[137:26] do you think it's going to work uh with
[137:29] elwin CSS
[137:32] though because it looks like I need to
[137:35] inject those
[137:46] Style
[137:48] document
[138:07] Fe oh okay maybe I would have to re
[138:10] render those components uh Rea server
[138:16] elements
[138:33] sh yeah okay yeah I think
[138:36] it's it's going to spend a lot of time
[138:39] on this
[138:46] um
[138:58] the the entire internet should be using
[139:00] laptop devices only so that will fix
[139:07] it
[139:08] right okay uh if anyone is joining right
[139:11] now uh the download invoice feature
[139:14] works but not on mobile
[139:19] because just crop like the cropping is
[139:22] wrong yeah I just make the text a little
[139:24] bit
[139:25] smaller they keep the same aspect
[139:36] ratio see what we get
[139:46] here
[139:53] that could
[139:55] work we don't see the
[139:58] screen hey
[140:00] yo we meet
[140:13] here Rea okay rect p
[140:23] you don't see the
[140:24] screen you guys want see my
[140:35] screen we just gone the entire Bali
[140:38] fiber connection is uh is
[140:46] over
[140:56] right thank you to
[141:02] correct I think I'm going to stick with
[141:05] yeah okay I'm going to take it very
[141:07] simple I'm going to make sure this is
[141:09] responsive on mobile
[141:12] so so we
[141:16] can have the invoice without going too
[141:19] crazy
[141:22] um people think
[141:27] oops the name of it table EXs May SM
[141:35] maybe
[141:38] table is that it
[141:46] no
[141:51] step
[142:00] somewhere where is my T here you
[142:15] goil maybe the table as doesn't exist
[142:20] um let's see what Daisy UI
[142:29] says it does exist where did I go wrong
[142:35] then oh maybe it was already a table
[142:38] small
[142:40] table let's see oh yeah I think that
[142:42] worked oh yeah okay that
[142:45] works well pi 12 pixels okay this is
[142:51] working we probably need to have this
[143:05] separat yeah let's make it responsive
[143:07] and I think we can give this a go so the
[143:11] text
[143:12] area
[143:16] here this should
[143:19] be
[143:22] okay and there should be probably G up
[143:26] six yeah should have a little Gap
[143:32] here x XL xlg
[143:39] MD is the other place I think it was
[143:41] somewhere at the
[143:44] top
[143:46] um
[143:52] invo
[143:54] it than
[144:06] you better
[144:15] attack yes yes yes
[144:25] yes the table um think we also want this
[144:30] on mobile to probably be a little bit
[144:32] bigger in case it's a higher price it
[144:35] might mess up the
[144:37] grid
[144:41] so think we might want to do
[144:45] this
[144:49] yeah
[144:50] probably yeah okay
[145:01] definitely okay oh
[145:05] yeah so normally on mobile I download it
[145:10] this is not the exact format from stripe
[145:13] but yeah this is
[145:15] working the
[145:24] invoice all right I think this is
[145:29] good no can't access the sh G the shif
[145:32] has G Breo um there's a to get it it's
[145:36] it's a paid product so you will have to
[145:38] go on the
[145:39] link someone's coming in my house
[145:42] sorry you would have to go on the link
[145:45] somewhere in this chat and uh purchase
[145:48] the the boiler plates and then you can
[145:49] access the repo if you did access the
[145:51] repo if you did purchase but didn't get
[145:54] access let me know your
[146:04] email how long we've been on uh it's a
[146:07] short one yesterday I did 3 hours and
[146:10] probably today is going to be a bit
[146:15] longer hopefully we can launch this
[146:17] thing here this
[146:19] week should be done by the end of the
[146:21] week might not be perfect but should be
[146:26] working okay the text area now B two
[146:30] this I think will not be
[146:45] changeable
[146:51] what do we want to change in those bills
[146:53] we want to
[146:59] change should we let the user change
[147:02] every information just
[147:04] prefill with the customer name customer
[147:08] country and
[147:10] customer email and then just let them
[147:14] yeah I think yeah we're going to let
[147:15] them
[147:18] okay yeah we're going to let them change
[147:20] everything they want so we will need
[147:23] some customer info what
[147:27] was how would I STI
[147:32] this think I did this for Indie page
[147:44] uh what do we have here
[147:48] T
[147:51] placeholder herec
[147:58] F right
[148:01] let's customer
[148:14] uh so every time we're going to change
[148:17] the invoice the customer is currently uh
[148:19] seeing we will have to reset those
[148:22] information and
[148:24] prefill customer
[148:29] details we'll need a use effect
[148:33] somewhere like a cleanup
[148:36] function
[148:39] customer
[148:43] details think we're going to see this
[148:50] um and we're going to say
[148:54] that when the invoice to
[148:57] edit
[148:58] uh reset
[149:10] customer
[149:12] okay if we
[149:15] CL here
[149:18] oh
[149:24] wait oh yeah
[149:28] okay if we don't have any invoice to
[149:31] edits then we're going to set it to
[149:34] nothing
[149:35] else we're going to set set customer
[149:42] details and here we're going to
[149:44] prefill okay yeah there we go
[149:47] customer name customer email okay I'm
[149:49] going to try with with this first and
[149:52] see I get something working and so here
[149:55] in the text
[149:56] [Music]
[149:59] area or should we have this in maybe we
[150:02] should just
[150:04] change well actually
[150:07] maybe no okay no it's going to be a m
[150:09] yeah I'm going to have to change this
[150:11] thing
[150:14] um let's see what we get for IND
[150:17] page for getet how to set this up in
[150:20] react T
[150:29] area get a text area like
[150:33] this
[150:35] text the value okay nothing special
[150:45] here
[150:52] custom
[150:55] details okay let's see so Okay we
[150:59] prefill okay we prefill with
[151:03] that probably we want to do some text
[151:15] area
[151:26] width I think we're going to make it
[151:27] [Music]
[151:30] full yeah there we go margin top we want
[151:34] to do
[151:39] to we probably want to delete the email
[151:42] as well build to and yeah this is
[151:46] editable form
[151:51] so
[152:03] leading CSS takes car
[152:15] change
[152:45] ser
[152:50] oh yeah
[152:57] okay
[153:00] relaxed build to
[153:03] okay so normally now if I download this
[153:06] invoice I will get whatever this is I
[153:09] type in here I will need
[153:11] to I think I'll need a bit of CSS
[153:15] there
[153:23] yes
[153:30] okay
[153:36] yeah
[153:37] [Music]

[210:04] all
[210:09] right uh
[210:12] are we back on I think we're back on
[210:15] hello everyone if there's still someone
[210:17] in the Stream been off for an hour went
[210:20] for a little um lunch
[210:26] break still streaming on YouTube okay
[210:29] okay we'll still there at least okay
[210:32] this good
[210:34] um well okay
[210:36] so
[210:38] um this is uh this is
[210:41] the the second part of the stream for
[210:43] today uh I'll be streaming for probably
[210:46] two more maybe three more hours
[210:48] something like
[210:49] that if you have no idea who I am I am
[210:52] markl uh I uh I create mini startups in
[210:57] public on Twitter um have a few online
[211:01] internets many businesses running and I
[211:04] often get customers asking for
[211:07] invoices uh and then I have to find
[211:10] their um profile into stripe I have to
[211:13] uh get the the information get the
[211:15] invoice downloaded it send it to send
[211:17] the invoice to them and sometimes I
[211:19] would also get uh questions about like
[211:21] how do I edit my invoice forget to add
[211:23] my business details to it and so I'm
[211:26] trying to make a very tiny app to fixes
[211:29] to fix this um this is called Zenvo this
[211:32] is the day two of building it the IDE is
[211:35] that for stripe business account owners
[211:38] um you would connect all your stripe
[211:39] accounts with restricted API key Keys
[211:41] you would get a unique link that you
[211:43] could send to your customers customers
[211:44] would input their email so that they can
[211:46] retrieve the invoice edit the invoice
[211:48] and download the
[211:49] invoices pretty much it it's a very
[211:51] simple app we started building
[211:53] yesterday um where we are now we are
[211:57] here we have
[212:00] uh we have created a dashboard for
[212:03] people to be able
[212:05] to um add the extrap accounts this is
[212:07] ugly uh I'm uh I'm just doing something
[212:11] for now and then I will add The Branding
[212:13] um people can add their strap accounts
[212:16] um add their secret restricted API keys
[212:18] they would get a unique link that it
[212:21] will share with the customers and then
[212:22] the customers could input their invoices
[212:24] just like
[212:25] this um the customer will be able to see
[212:28] all the invoices they've made for any of
[212:30] the businesses owned by the person and
[212:34] they will be able to edit those invoices
[212:36] so this is a stripe invoice and here
[212:39] there is a form so customers can say
[212:41] like hey you know my name is not ASFD
[212:44] but it's actually marloo and then it can
[212:46] download the invoice normally we should
[212:48] have something that's working okay here
[212:51] we go and then we have invoices like
[212:53] this
[212:54] one and that's pretty much it um I'm
[212:58] building solo so I have no
[213:00] um no
[213:02] employees so nothing is is perfect I'm
[213:06] not a good marketer I'm not a good
[213:08] programmer but I do a little bit of
[213:09] everything and by the end of this uh
[213:12] series of videos in this stream we
[213:14] should be able to have a little startup
[213:15] that's ready to be launched on product
[213:17] tent um also I am not a streamer it this
[213:22] is the third time I stream my
[213:25] programming it's very hard for me to
[213:27] think when I uh when I I uh code so I
[213:33] might suck at it sometimes I might say
[213:35] things that that don't make any sense um
[213:38] so sorry about that uh that's the best I
[213:41] can
[213:42] do all right uh we're
[213:47] connected okay generation James okay the
[213:51] chat is back
[213:53] nice what are you using for the PDF
[213:55] generation man I'm
[213:57] I'm so if customers don't edit the
[214:00] invoice I'm using the stripe link this
[214:03] one is going to C it's just going to use
[214:05] the link posted invoice link by stripe
[214:09] and if they added invoice
[214:11] then I just made a copy HTML copy of
[214:13] destroy template invoice templates and
[214:16] when they click download it takes a
[214:17] screenshot of this and download it in
[214:21] the uh person's file
[214:28] storage yo
[214:31] Melvin it's a end of your
[214:35] uh something like four to six hours of
[214:37] productivity time where uh you you
[214:40] joined the world after your launch time
[214:43] here with us this is it um
[214:48] okay okay we'll need to fix this uh by
[214:51] default I think it prefills yeah the
[214:53] customer name the customer email we need
[214:55] to organize this so that it looks like
[214:58] that uh we need to fix the margins as
[215:02] well CU we're going to take a screenshot
[215:04] of this thing so we need to make sure
[215:07] the margins are
[215:08] right uh we are back here margin should
[215:11] be minus two I
[215:14] think it's probably not enough oh yeah I
[215:17] think it should be minus three
[215:21] actually yeah okay we're aligned with
[215:27] that okay we'll need to prefill with
[215:29] some
[215:30] information so this should be around
[215:34] okay
[215:37] here this is working if I search an
[215:40] invoice
[215:41] okay it's putting this on the line this
[215:43] is good what else do we want to show
[215:46] name what El stripe shows
[215:50] actually
[215:53] customer see customers or maybe invoices
[215:56] that will be
[215:57] simpler let's Download a pdf
[216:03] invoice right so what we have here we
[216:05] have the name of the person the country
[216:07] address whatever and the email of the
[216:09] person
[216:11] so back to the code we're going to
[216:14] prefill with customer email customer
[216:15] name that makes sense then here we need
[216:18] to prefill with the customer address
[216:22] which which which which which which I'll
[216:24] find
[216:24] [Music]
[216:28] somewhere really
[216:31] nope customer address there we
[216:36] go or should we display that um well
[216:39] maybe I'll go back
[216:41] to
[216:52] devices see with a real world example of
[216:58] that okay so
[217:07] customer customer address
[217:14] [Music]
[217:17] um I would make sense uh probably line
[217:22] one postal
[217:24] code
[217:27] State
[217:29] invoice see if we get some more examples
[217:31] real examples of
[217:36] that yeah this not
[217:39] helping
[218:06] um okay that is good okay right this is
[218:09] what we look
[218:18] for oh there's a text thing we didn't
[218:22] pay attention
[218:26] to okay all right we'll see this
[218:29] later invoice number invoice blah blah
[218:35] blah here we have something so we have
[218:37] first the line address the name
[218:45] same
[218:47] line 6B what is 6B
[219:03] exactly line
[219:07] one C probably line to and
[219:27] Country
[219:34] City
[219:35] oh City
[219:39] address
[219:41] oh wait maybe I'm going to ask chpt is
[219:43] going to probably much better than me
[219:45] for
[219:49] that going to say something
[219:54] like
[220:01] customer and email like
[220:05] this then oh no I cannot copy
[220:09] p
[220:14] give me some magic
[220:17] chpt yeah not so
[220:22] good let's see maybe
[220:28] this
[220:30] nope think I want the city
[220:38] here oh wait maybe the state should be
[220:58] before what do we get here
[221:00] so I think it's an empty invoice though
[221:03] so it will probably look like nothing
[221:06] here I'll have to fix that
[221:11] uh in one city and state are
[221:39] is
[221:55] feel
[222:08] no
[222:16] I have to go through all
[222:21] that oh it still creat a space
[222:31] here okay I think I'll I'll will use
[222:34] JavaScript for
[222:38] that
[222:48] have
[223:08] okay
[223:30] CT State also coding
[223:38] country
[223:42] we going to filter everything
[223:48] that's and we're going to
[223:53] map oh yeah we can
[223:57] join see how that
[224:01] works okay Yep this is
[224:03] good we need to convert the country code
[224:07] to uh
[224:10] country codee
[224:13] converter
[224:16] japt actually maybe I don't need to do
[224:19] that so I can ask my
[224:21] co-pilot format here maybe you can say
[224:24] like a entry code
[224:28] to to like to country

[233:55] recipient's V8 number where could we get
[234:07] that
[234:13] tax
[234:15] ideas European
[234:23] bet the customer
[234:27] tax will contain the same taex ID as
[234:37] customer value of the text ID
[234:41] okay okay I think we need to display
[234:43] that customer
[234:46] idel array object
[234:52] with and
[234:54] value we show GB
[234:58] vat which I guess is
[235:02] this GB
[235:07] okay okay
[235:10] so
[235:14] here f it it has to be under
[235:19] okay okay we're going to display it
[235:22] here if invoice
[235:26] to F
[235:30] again customer text
[235:37] ideas

[236:14] should have only one so X
[236:17] ID
[236:30] zero here it should
[236:36] be okay is it so if we have the value
[236:42] for the text ID we're going to
[236:48] display the value and just
[236:53] before we're going to say it's type
[236:58] type and for that it's always the same
[237:07] shapeit
[237:14] yeah there's always a underscore except
[237:17] here so we're going to
[237:37] split
[237:43] if
[238:07] uh

[256:28] putr download
[256:31] it it's my new invoice
[256:34] okay and this one
[257:00] we want to
[257:01] lose lose the focus on Mi area
[257:15] righty that looks like a stripe
[257:17] invoice I think we're
[257:22] good
[257:24] um when it's large we can make a little
[257:27] bit bigger
[257:31] petting
[257:34] yeah oh no
[257:42] okay yeah that looks
[257:47] better
[257:49] I'm
[257:54] get all right
[258:01] sick
[258:05] invoices
[258:10] M Ling boy what is
[258:15] that loing boy what did you use for the
[258:19] authentification um I use ship fman so
[258:22] it's next
[258:24] oath yeah next
[258:26] oath call why someone STS you're brave
[258:29] man the this is fun because it's
[258:31] actually really hard I'm uh it's my
[258:35] third time streaming and and I I have I
[258:39] I'm so much slow slower now that I I
[258:42] know that you guys are
[258:44] watching so yeah I'm huge respect for
[258:47] the streamers out there because it's
[258:48] really hard and also trying to keep the
[258:50] stream engaging so it's not you know
[258:52] boring and it's just just not just a
[258:54] random guy coding this is really
[259:01] hard
[259:03] yo what is that M loing boy did you make
[259:07] that new Twitter account or
[259:12] is I need to investigate that
[259:15] thing this could be could it be
[259:22] Stefan oh sick
[259:31] nice all right so this is
[259:35] functional I think
[259:39] this is really ugly I think we now that
[259:42] we have all the
[259:48] pieces of information yeah there's
[259:52] nothing people can add accounts remove
[259:55] those Add
[260:01] accounts get a special
[260:03] link give the special link to customers
[260:06] customers input
[260:08] email get all the
[260:15] invoices and edit all those
[260:35] invoices
[261:35] um
[261:59] I think this is
[262:05] good
[262:35] think
[262:54] I mean yeah technically you could do
[262:57] that which means first you would have to
[262:59] get the unique link of the business and
[263:03] the second part uh if you already have
[263:06] 20,000 emails from the business you
[263:08] probably have way more information like
[263:10] there's no way you hack a 20,000
[263:15] emails we cannot hear you okay are you
[263:18] sure actually this my mic shows
[263:35] return
[263:37] let me
[263:39] checks actually I
[263:41] hear it could be on your side I think
[263:43] because I can hear myself on my phone so
[263:45] yeah no um I mean there there's
[263:48] definitely a security concern but at
[263:50] some point if you have those 20,000
[263:53] emails uh this is I don't know you
[263:56] you've already done you've already
[263:58] hacked the business so much I don't
[263:59] think uh
[264:01] having the addresses is something that
[264:03] would be tricky to
[264:05] get
[264:11] yeah but that's a good that's a good
[264:12] point I
[264:13] might I might double check the what
[264:17] information do we send back I think we
[264:19] we don't actually send any information
[264:22] that's sensitive here the invoices are
[264:26] it's meant to be public it's meant to be
[264:27] shared with your accountants
[264:32] and let me see I don't think there is
[264:34] anything that's uh
[264:52] yeah all right um yeah I think it's time
[264:56] to style the app a little
[264:59] bit so we don't have just this this
[265:03] thing here um I think I will be reusing
[265:07] the fonts from bu
[265:09] disput it's pretty neat fonts and
[265:17] also it's a beautiful
[265:22] fult
[265:33] see
[265:35] enter
[265:37] [Music]
[265:39] garito yeah there we go yeah that's a
[265:42] beautiful
[265:43] font like
[265:49] it let's explore if there is any and I
[265:52] think that's my favorite thing while
[265:55] doing a new project is it's finding the
[265:57] right font it's it makes such a big
[265:59] difference with such a little
[266:03] work um make sure sure we have at
[266:07] least at least
[266:09] five there's anything trendy right
[266:15] now it's always the same o well
[266:25] nope oh yeah we want to make sure we use
[266:29] sensory
[266:35] phones
[266:40] hey is quite
[266:42] nice you guys have any font in mind you
[266:45] want to give it a
[266:55] try easy to do
[266:59] that that's a beautiful one
[267:04] too
[267:10] bullish try
[267:19] this little
[267:21] bit why not why not I think I still
[267:24] prefer the previous one this one look
[267:26] more like
[267:32] stripe
[267:34] see
[267:39] this one or
[267:45] garito oh damn I love these phont I
[267:47] think I'm going to go for that one yeah
[267:49] it's a very beautiful
[268:04] font
[268:15] y zmg I am also in Bali I not in chungu
[268:19] though I am inasan in the South part of
[268:23] uh the
[268:34] island
[268:41] think we're going to change the theme
[268:42] color I think I'm yeah I think by
[268:45] disputes theme was
[268:48] nice compared
[268:51] to the
[268:53] defaults
[268:56] uh yeah I think I'm just going to change
[269:04] that no
[269:08] yeah okay it's not your
[269:34] fast
[270:07] [Music]
[270:13] yeah I think I'm going to reuse those
[270:16] colors that's a
[270:31] nice should we should we try green just
[270:35] for
[270:37] fun of the name of the
[270:41] startup think that would I don't think
[270:43] that would look good but who
[270:51] knows it's way too
[271:04] much
[271:06] it be
[271:34] green
[272:02] bour
[272:04] menu yep the font is called
[272:09] gabarito which
[272:14] color little
[272:27] more
[272:34] oops
[272:39] we go with
[272:49] that of like the
[272:54] green see
[273:04] if
[273:20] first one looks like was it called get
[273:22] ready to use refactoring
[273:25] UI yeah man this is a really good good
[273:29] idea
[273:34] yet
[273:49] kind of like the green though because
[273:50] the name of the app is Zen
[273:53] voice this Zen
[273:56] thing to make a
[273:59] logo Zen what do we have for Zen
[274:04] relax
[274:07] piece
[274:17] no
[274:26] here it could be this
[274:34] one
[274:50] oh maybe just something like
[274:53] this
[275:04] where
[275:08] we do
[275:10] that background color
[275:15] X not
[275:18] sure yeah I think the green is not
[275:20] really good it's
[275:22] too too
[275:26] bright oh well let's see what do we have
[275:32] menu legendary designer back
[275:39] what do we have
[276:01] here that could be the black I guess we
[276:05] would have something like this on top of
[276:07] it or maybe
[276:11] not what do you
[276:17] think oh sorry bro I didn't see your
[276:19] color RGB
[276:28] 2184 need to convert
[276:34] that 20 184
[276:38] 166
[276:46] [Music]
[276:47] 1846
[276:49] okay it's a mix in
[276:55] between get this one here
[277:01] too [ __ ] which one was it second one I
[277:04] think yeah second one
[277:06] we have this one too I think I like this
[277:10] one but it's probably a too sad for the
[277:13] app like too too dark too
[277:17] cold
[277:26] ah T Choice T
[277:34] choice
[277:47] yeah both are
[277:50] nice I think this one has a better fit
[277:53] with the white it I think it has more
[278:03] contrast
[278:24] the dark blue can beate that is very
[278:27] true oh that is very true okay well
[278:31] happy to give it a
[278:32] try here we go I think I think that was
[278:35] the one right is it was it no no I think
[278:38] that wasn't the
[278:39] one back to the
[278:43] chat yeah
[279:01] okay well I think this is
[279:03] good do you think the uh the white yeah
[279:08] I think the white has enough contrast
[279:12] with darken this instead yeah I think
[279:15] there is enough
[279:33] contrast
[279:43] I said was still 5
[279:48] okay green okay I think we I think we
[279:51] can go with that um I I don't think
[279:53] there will be much secondary color
[279:55] anyway but I like this one it's a nice
[279:59] greenish
[280:00] color it sounds good for an app called
[280:03] zen zen voice
[280:06] peaceful let make a little logo for
[280:08] [Music]
[280:15] it is working here
[280:19] okay Zen voice can we explore for
[280:33] icons
[280:38] maybe that could be
[280:41] the I think I'm going to go with that
[280:43] one or
[280:55] maybe that look
[281:03] good I think we're going to round the
[281:05] corners a little
[281:14] bit button five R how
[281:25] much eight pixels yeah okay that's not
[281:28] going to
[281:29] help
[281:33] probably
[281:51] rotate oh yeah
[281:57] no
[282:01] fight that
[282:03] works
[282:21] why
[282:24] not
[282:26] bit
[282:30] Shadow no I think we don't need Shadow
[282:32] for now cuz we're going to with that
[282:43] something we have
[282:51] here it's not a unicorn startup logo but
[282:55] I think that that
[283:01] works it's a nice logo simple
[283:15] going drop that
[283:19] um call Zen voice
[283:25] public
[283:33] ion
[283:50] okay it's a cute
[283:59] dep to later
[284:03] this
[284:06] [Music]
[284:09] I think this neutral color is a bit too
[284:11] much as
[284:11] [Music]
[284:13] well what is it St
[284:16] yeah base content I
[284:29] think neutral and neutral
[284:33] contents
[284:44] neutral
[285:03] neutral
[285:24] yeah yeah that could
[285:27] work maybe we make it a little bit
[285:32] uh slightly dark dark
[285:47] here too
[285:55] much I think I kind of like it
[286:02] simple think I'm
[286:04] unconsciously copying what stripe is
[286:08] doing where is it see there buttons oh
[286:12] no actually their buttons are
[286:15] more they're white
[286:18] okay
[286:33] oh
[286:43] oh wait actually we can do that
[287:03] um
[287:16] I think we can do the entire app with
[287:19] those show you a
[287:21] bigger screen of
[287:31] this
[287:33] here
[287:35] yeah I think that'll do
[287:47] it bring the strip data with email you
[287:50] and I been oh man it's been a while uh
[287:52] yes I
[287:53] did um actually I query so I query all
[287:59] customers first that have the email
[288:01] that's provided here
[288:04] and then from those customers I query
[288:06] all invoices under the SHP account that
[288:09] have the customer IDs that we just got
[288:12] from the email and from that I'll get a
[288:14] list of invoices
[288:16] here and then now U we can edit the
[288:21] invoice download it and here we go
[288:25] customers have their own invoice where
[288:27] they can add any information they want
[288:29] here by typing this is

[290:04] oh I think I made a little error here I
[290:12] shoulding slightly
[290:15] bigger then I can down
[290:25] again yeah I think this is
[290:32] it
[290:35] we don't want the padding yeah okay we
[290:38] have the logo yeah we now have the
[290:40] little logo it's fun because it's then I
[290:42] don't need to make a five
[290:45] econ for some reason how
[290:56] come it's fun it's
[291:00] why I could

[291:05] here the next we'll
[291:08] add if I have an icon on PNG is going to
[291:12] overwrite the five cone I
[291:14] think this is all right this is cool no
[291:19] need to make any Fon
[291:26] anymore all right it's time to style a
[291:30] bit um so this is the data we're going
[291:34] to get uh page
[291:39] contents invoice to edit there will be
[291:42] nothing in
[291:49] here
[291:50] okay so we're going to have this little
[291:59] page I
[292:01] think yeah we're going to we're going to
[292:03] be
[292:04] very going to do things really simp
[292:06] simple here
[292:09] but uh in the
[292:14] least okay I need some
[292:32] bad yep okay okay we
[292:36] got
[292:44] um
[292:45] status for
[292:50] status prob of
[292:53] there this draft open
[292:59] paid open paid void
[293:02] okay going to say that
[293:23] if
[293:24] normal

[293:36] success or nothing and I messed up
[293:41] somewhere yep
[293:46] here uh yeah this is supposed to be a
[293:48] bad
[293:57] right okay those are not the most
[294:00] some the stripe handle that
[294:07] yeah CU they don't have all the
[294:32] colors
[295:48] we have those invoices
[295:52] um I get banned from from the stripe API
[295:55] for quering so many
[295:57] times
[295:59] uh invoice number created ad download
[296:02] edits I think I'm just going to make
[296:05] this just a
[296:07] random I'm just going to Center that I
[296:09] think should that should be
[296:11] enough
[296:18] uh so we are
[296:20] [Music]
[296:22] have Max with
[296:26] excess
[296:28] think Max
[296:31] with 5 XL mxo
[296:37] photo I think this big
[296:51] enough oh no no no forget it's supposed
[296:55] to
[296:58] be yeah this is here me height screen
[297:02] okay
[297:03] you
[297:05] want
[297:07] okay here you have all the invoices that
[297:10] you might may have made we're going to
[297:13] Center the buttons on the
[297:32] right
[297:44] [Music]

[297:59] okay
[298:02] case
[298:30] X six that was good
[299:01] okay f
[299:03] love the content you make
[299:05] mark thank you buddy I appreciate it
[299:09] just reading the chat on my phone is
[299:11] a super tiny the best way I found to
[299:15] read the
[299:16] chat
[299:20] best to just amazing to work yep yeah
[299:24] tail wi is a game changer so much
[299:31] easier um
[299:48] think here we will need uh some kind of
[299:56] scroll make sure that doesn't
[300:01] overlap
[300:04] f um this Fleck stable is not displayed
[300:15] properly maybe shrink zero I have no
[300:17] idea what I'm
[300:25] doing oh
[300:31] [ __ ]
[300:46] all right we can add
[301:01] this
[301:24] I I think being too picky here I think
[301:28] there should be
[301:31] enough
[301:37] all
[301:48] right
[301:50] model opacity of
[302:01] 70
[302:31] what
[302:34] all
[302:40] right resize the window a little
[302:42] bit see what we
[302:49] got so scrolling nicely okay okay I
[302:53] think we're done with the link for the
[302:54] customer from the customer side might
[302:58] not want to Index this page
[303:00] though think
[303:09] um we
[303:13] know is exactly my
[303:17] question
[303:21] okay robots
[303:31] index
[303:56] exports I don't remember how I do my own
[304:00] code terrible terrible there we
[304:05] go um oh yeah export okay tile
[304:31] um
[305:00] robots index
[305:10] dat next
[305:24] yes yep index false follow true no cash
[305:30] true everything in there
[305:40] here what do I have here going
[305:46] on can't
[305:47] resolve yep probably this should
[305:51] work
[306:01] yep
[306:04] and here we want to do a no index making
[306:07] sure robust no index
[306:11] follow
[306:13] okay I want to Index this content okay
[306:16] so the customer side is done I
[306:22] guess here my page get your
[306:26] invoice here and I have all my invoices
[306:31] okay
[306:33] oh I need to do a try with
[306:48] this oh
[307:01] yeah
[307:26] oh
[307:31] no
[308:01] okay
[308:25] so it is time to go to the
[308:29] dashboard um so here this is the
[308:33] dash the dashboard of people who
[308:38] register and that's how they going to
[308:40] create their strap accounts their link
[308:43] where they will be all their strap
[308:45] accounts connected so that people can
[308:47] search their email so we need to have
[308:50] this little thing somewhere like login
[308:52] log out we need to have this as well the
[308:55] link to Cy past
[308:57] it and those cards here to add and
[309:01] remove trap
[309:03] accounts
[309:05] um not going to bother too much I think
[309:07] I'm going to
[309:09] copy what I did for B
[309:23] disput this okay yeah I think I'm going
[309:25] to redo something similar
[309:28] there the little dashboard all the Trap
[309:31] accounts will be displayed here there's
[309:33] nothing much to do on them just adding
[309:35] more accounts
[309:39] so every we going to copy that all right
[309:42] I need a little te in order to keep
[309:46] moving
[309:48] on I'll be back in a few minutes
[310:01] cheers
[316:57] get
[317:00] gold
[317:02] welcome
[317:05] back there we go so yeah 4:30 I think
[317:09] I'll be streaming for another hour or
[317:14] so yep I think we should be done with
[317:16] the user dashboard and then we can move
[317:19] on
[317:20] to um deploy lab um adding a pay wall
[317:25] and designing the landing page and the
[317:29] copywriting um if you are tuning in
[317:31] right now we are making a stripe invoice
[317:35] generator editor so that customers can
[317:37] download and edit and download their
[317:39] invoices simply without uh stripe
[317:42] business owners like me like myself
[317:44] having to go to a stripe accounts search
[317:48] for the customer's invoice download it
[317:50] send it to the
[317:51] customer um trying to make this a little
[317:54] bit simpler because that's the pretty
[317:55] much most of my customer Supports is uh
[317:59] is for this kind of things so I'm trying
[318:00] to autom
[318:09] it wa it's scen time here we
[318:16] go okay
[318:21] um voice is
[318:26] here think here we'll need
[318:30] uh
[318:47] copy everything that I've done for this
[318:51] startup and reuse it because it should
[318:55] be very
[318:57] similar oops type anymore
[319:07] page
[319:30] right
[319:38] I'm going to explain what I'm doing in a
[319:40] second I'm just where for now I'm uh
[319:42] just copy pasting some
[320:00] code
[320:08] God damn
[320:25] it D it's coming back is those guys my
[320:28] neighbors I don't know what they're
[320:28] doing but they're pulling the trees from
[320:30] my garden
[320:34] D it can't I
[320:38] focus what are you doing
[320:40] brother okay I have to come
[321:00] back
[321:30] okay
[322:29] yep
[322:47] so I have the link this is what
[322:59] account
[323:56] um okay all
[323:59] right has
[324:02] uh is
[324:09] it all right so we have the user
[324:11] accounts I think at the top here we will
[324:13] have a buy
[324:23] button button account can be a bit
[324:27] smaller
[324:29] case
[324:40] okay we have small
[324:54] smaller l in log out [ __ ] probably yeah
[324:59] that will be available after after the
[325:01] first
[325:01] purchase here there will be a way for
[325:04] people to purchase this
[325:07] thing have no idea how we're going to
[325:09] handle the pricing but we'll see that
[325:12] later
[325:20] um we also have
[325:27] this
[325:29] yeah
[325:34] here link and here we also have a
[325:38] link you pass my
[325:53] linkit the
[325:59] key I think I'm going to remove that
[326:02] part and make it
[326:07] simpler here I'm going to say something
[326:15] like button
[326:24] stels and had a little description
[326:29] underneath
[326:36] will be able to
[326:40] search
[326:45] invoices
[326:49] oh I forgot
[326:54] something I did forgot
[326:59] something
[327:05] we want to display the
[327:08] business here somewhere we want to tell
[327:11] the customer Which business it is so I
[327:13] think on the
[327:16] page AG
[327:17] [Music]
[327:20] content on the amount
[327:23] section here we will
[327:28] need business
[327:32] and we'll add a new
[327:47] role I
[327:50] think that will be name
[327:54] um.
[327:56] stripe
[327:59] account forget how it's called yep not
[328:29] name
[328:31] it's strip
[328:33] account
[328:36] not
[328:41] accounts see it again memory color oh
[328:44] yeah that was Tri
[328:49] counts oh I think it's because it
[328:51] doesn't have a name because I'm in test
[328:54] mode
[328:55] yeah so normally we should see the name
[328:59] um
[329:04] yeah well there should be a name here
[329:07] because in my
[329:10] model it is here name
[329:14] so rep
[329:29] account
[329:32] yeah
[329:37] okay here that will
[329:41] be that will be the name of the
[329:58] business okay
[330:12] going back to the
[330:13] dashboard on the
[330:22] page add a strip account so button strip
[330:29] count next pleas
[330:35] content
[330:38] um
[330:41] search customers are able to search for
[330:48] invoices and
[330:59] download
[331:13] there these
[331:29] accounts
[331:33] so
[331:42] first right so we wanton
[331:47] model we want to take this thing here
[331:59] it's
[332:10] uh generates a restricted AP
[332:29] key
[332:51] restricted API
[332:53] [Music]
[332:58] key
[333:02] do not change any res
[333:15] [Music]
[333:18] permission change resource information
[333:21] and click create key at the bottom right
[333:23] of the
[333:25] page right
[333:28] page
[333:32] copy the P the
[333:58] keyow
[334:11] so generate a restri thep
[334:17] key
[334:23] key
[334:25] input and we
[334:28] go
[334:33] and pass the new
[334:38] AP All right so that should be a bit
[334:43] simpler add a new strap account your
[334:45] customer will be able to search and edit
[334:47] download invoices under these accounts
[334:49] generate a new restrict IP key here not
[334:52] change any permission c key at the
[334:55] bottom right of the page op pass this
