[00:00] we launched 36 hours ago
[00:04] $68,000
[00:07] relx what took you so
[00:10] long just sh a new feature should I
[00:13] [Music]
[00:16] click blue pill or the red
[00:25] pill I just shipped a new feature on
[00:28] ship fast it's called Perks it's
[00:30] basically a list of discounts for
[00:32] popular products I'm so happy cuz I was
[00:34] able to work with versal which is one of
[00:35] the most common hosting platform out
[00:38] there as well as some really cool other
[00:40] products I'm about to add another one
[00:42] called recent to send emails and the
[00:44] entire bundle is worth over $1,000 in
[00:48] discount I'm carefully handpicking
[00:50] product that either help people save
[00:51] money or make more money cuz my goal is
[00:53] to help a th000 makers make $1,000
[00:55] online and also now at the same time on
[00:58] my landing page I can say things like
[01:00] this where I can show how much worth of
[01:03] discounts people can expect to get and
[01:05] that makes the price of the ball plates
[01:07] looks cheap compared to that so I hope
[01:10] that will improve a little bit the
[01:11] conversion
[01:13] [Music]
[01:19] [Music]
[01:21] rate okay so we are two days before
[01:24] black Friday everything was planned and
[01:25] scheduled and I do the last checkup with
[01:27] my friends I always do that whenever I
[01:29] launch a new startups I always send it
[01:31] to a couple of my friends ask what they
[01:32] think about it because when I build a
[01:35] learning page I'm always in my head and
[01:37] sometimes I don't see things and it
[01:39] would be a terrible mistake if I just
[01:40] ship the startups as it is so I ask a
[01:43] few people around me what they think
[01:44] about it and this is not good ah I was
[01:47] really convinced that the landing page
[01:49] was great like good enough to launch and
[01:50] all my friends from different background
[01:52] told me it is not good at all like
[01:55] really I got really poor feedback uh the
[01:58] problem is I have 2 days left I I just
[02:00] don't I I I don't even know what I will
[02:01] have time to do build it launch
[02:07] [Music]
[02:10] it wow
[02:12] you're man my heart just m be like crazy
[02:14] all right I want to see where surf
[02:17] brings the cardio level I don't think I
[02:20] get this exhausted when I surf what's
[02:22] the next so we made the cardio heat goes
[02:25] up next is a little bit of muscle
[02:26] strengths I do planks then I usually do
[02:29] at pull-ups push-ups push-ups and 40
[02:32] pull-up chein up for 20 pull-up 20
[02:35] whatever and uh that's it it's either
[02:37] cardio at home or surf which also does
[02:40] the cardio and build muscles but then I
[02:42] don't really leave we apart really
[02:45] sometimes so I try to have always like
[02:46] those CH up P up push-up Etc so I do a
[02:48] little bit of strength as well not just
[02:50] cardio since I didn't do any ABS I'm
[02:52] going to do a little bit
[02:56] this it's
[03:02] I'm going to say something very
[03:03] controversial but I think my strength is
[03:05] my laziness because I know I would never
[03:07] be able to go to the gym I know I would
[03:09] never have the courage to go to the gym
[03:11] and do the communting and spending two
[03:12] hours and thinking about the gym because
[03:15] I'm lazy and I don't want to do that I
[03:17] try to find my own constraints and rules
[03:20] in my laziness bubble interesting
[03:22] because people need to investment to
[03:24] feel more motivated they need that
[03:26] membership to show up if is a home they
[03:29] be EAS it to compromising it's a really
[03:32] good point it's a really good I think it
[03:34] come it boils down to how you are like
[03:36] what how what's your way of doing things
[03:39] the book Atomic habits James Clear mhm
[03:43] one of the first book I read after after
[03:45] I didn't read any books because High
[03:47] School make me hate reading it's prob
[03:49] the first book I read and it says they
[03:51] make it so easy you can't say no and
[03:53] that's that's very true like start with
[03:55] 10 push-ups per day
[03:58] beginning new what took you so long I
[04:01] guess your 9 to5 became a 9 to9 this is
[04:04] where people realize I am 12 years
[04:06] old this is my favorite part of
[04:08] launching startups is you know I haven't
[04:10] done any of those videos this year the
[04:13] last one it was with mat Maki no go
[04:15] everywhere Dad they are my friends I
[04:18] talk to them oh for logo Fest which was
[04:21] December last year logo Fest the fre you
[04:24] made 5,000 in 3 days yes that's it one
[04:26] why do you make the video before lunch
[04:28] because the internet is crowded and at
[04:30] some points if you want to get your
[04:31] message across the room you have to find
[04:33] something that feels like you mhm that
[04:35] people will give their time to watch
[04:38] what you have to offer and because of
[04:40] that they'll give me like a minute of
[04:41] their time to look at what I have to
[04:43] offer and it happens that eventually if
[04:45] they're learning if they're trying to
[04:46] learn how to code they might watch like
[04:48] they might visit the site and might even
[04:50] purchase and I think the the purpose of
[04:52] this video is eventually to get
[04:53] attention in a way that feels genuine
[04:55] that feels like my way of getting
[04:56] attention basically CH P found the right
[04:59] movie for me I know what I'm going to
[05:01] sell I know roughly you know the angle
[05:03] the angle is very important once we talk
[05:05] again is I'm not making just another
[05:07] course and you're making the course to
[05:09] learn to code for entrepreneurs not
[05:11] employees entrepreneurs this is very
[05:13] important because then you can dit 90%
[05:15] of all the stuff you have to learn when
[05:17] you're a software engineer or an
[05:18] employee so it's a minimal course that
[05:20] teach you everything you need to know to
[05:22] go from zero to a software I think when
[05:24] you I mean like most people I guess you
[05:27] eat around 2 hours before bed M you eat
[05:29] that 700 and you go to bed at 9:00 or
[05:30] you eat at 8:00 you go to bed at at
[05:32] 10:00 we used to do that and then we
[05:34] started to do 6: and 5: p.m. 3 4 5 hours
[05:38] before bed and we realize that when we
[05:41] go back to the original 2 hours before
[05:43] bed the heartbeat is actually racing M
[05:46] and when you do four five hours before
[05:47] it's like you're much more relaxed data
[05:49] says we have better deep sleep and I
[05:51] feel much better as well MH you do feel
[05:53] any difference
[05:56] after I don't see much difference
[05:58] between five and 7 hours like we do now
[06:01] yeah for us I think the big shift is at
[06:03] least 4 hours before bed you're done 4
[06:05] hours before bed you don't touch any
[06:06] food even not water so you don't go to
[06:08] toilet when you wake
[06:12] up now it's 8:00 p.m. still rolling man
[06:18] we never working that late yeah we
[06:20] normally finish work at least at 6 and
[06:24] wow a long day I think it's honestly one
[06:27] of the stress most stressful lunch I've
[06:28] ever done yeah yeah I'm launching late
[06:31] because of Black Friday like I have a
[06:33] deadline and so I have to check every
[06:34] little thing like there's so many things

[09:32] yeah that makes me so happy man one of
[09:34] the best moments I I like most Joy I

[09:51] what happened with sheep fast and the
[09:52] she fast testimon the greed of love like
[09:54] the wall of Love on cheep fast is
[09:56] probably it's honestly my happiest place
[09:58] to go on the internet go there and I see

[10:36] [Applause]
[10:37] [Music]
[10:54] guys oo
[10:57] [Music]
[11:00] where oh a
[11:03] little
[11:07] hello I am still sick but we're doing it
[11:10] anyway uh it's been almost 7 days I
[11:12] launched cast and this is a little recap
[11:14] of what happened uh it made close to
[11:17] $200,000 us in a week and this is
[11:20] absolutely mental I had no idea it would
[11:24] work this well I knew it would work
[11:26] somehow I'll show you why later but this
[11:29] much man this is just crazy so I want to
[11:33] break down a few things about marketing
[11:35] and finding ideas first let's quickly
[11:38] look at the launch uh you can see here
[11:40] uh this is number of visitors so almost
[11:42] 50,000 visitors and uh whooping
[11:46] $4.4 generated per visitor which is
[11:49] again this is insane I've never had this
[11:51] before the best product I've had was
[11:53] ship fast and he was close to $2 per
[11:55] visitor at his best so this here shows
[11:58] me like there is something big coming
[12:00] Revenue wise it's mostly coming from
[12:02] Twitter uh YouTube and a little bit of
[12:05] LinkedIn and I guess Google or people
[12:07] who've heard of it on social media and
[12:09] search for it I'm PR impressed by how
[12:11] spreaded it is there there's like
[12:13] purchases from a little bit all over the
[12:15] planet which makes me very happy so um I
[12:18] saw this tweet from Max a couple days
[12:20] ago that he thought the course would
[12:22] never sell and there are a few things at
[12:25] play here the first one is when we come
[12:27] up with ideas on what's to build what is
[12:30] what could be a promise promising idea
[12:32] you want to check a few boxes one of the
[12:34] first one is you want to build something
[12:36] that solve your own problems I see too
[12:38] many people coming up with what if I
[12:40] combine this Tech Plus that market and I
[12:42] make a product out of nowhere the
[12:44] problem with that is like it's pure
[12:45] blind guesses and well it's fun you can
[12:48] ship an idea in one week but but the
[12:50] odds of success are very unlikely
[12:51] product like this one's invoice this is
[12:53] not making crazy amount of money if we
[12:55] look at it is making around $1,000 per
[12:58] month but it's zero maintenance zero
[13:00] customer support it's fully on autopilot
[13:02] and it's working like clockwork every
[13:04] single month and I know it would work
[13:06] because I experience the issue I know
[13:08] that when I pay invoices on stripe I
[13:10] have to give them 4% to generate a PDF
[13:14] and so by solving my own problem could
[13:16] potentially guess that some other people
[13:18] have the same issue as me and so that
[13:20] almost guarantees me that if I build a
[13:22] product I will have customers now I knew
[13:25] how to code already I don't need a
[13:26] course to learn how to code the reason I
[13:28] came up with this idea is because I have
[13:30] a YouTube channel and I read every
[13:32] comments on this YouTube channel and one
[13:34] of my best performing videos if you
[13:36] search for how to you end up on finding
[13:39] gems on what people want to achieve how
[13:42] to buy domain name for your project how
[13:44] to build this amazing UI Builders how to
[13:46] make a responsive website how to make
[13:48] those websites seeing these comments
[13:51] over and over tells me that people
[13:53] somewhere on the internet have a problem
[13:55] and it appears that I have the solution
[13:57] cuz I know how to code and this this is
[13:59] how I came up with the idea of code fast
[14:01] a course that teaches people how to code
[14:03] to build those tiny businesses if you go
[14:05] to udm and you search for JavaScript or
[14:07] react you will find hundreds of Great
[14:10] Courses already so with SC fast I knew
[14:12] that there was a huge demand and I also
[14:14] knew that the market is very competitive
[14:16] and when you enter a competitive market
[14:18] you want to have one marketing angle you
[14:20] you want to have you want to find one
[14:22] thing that sets you apart from all the
[14:24] other competitors and the good part is I
[14:26] use UD me myself to teach myself how to
[14:28] code and I remember seeing those courses
[14:30] where you would have 68 hours of content
[14:33] for JavaScript and then you would have
[14:35] 70 hours of content for no JS and
[14:37] another 30 hours to learn HTML and then
[14:40] in the end you would have like a package
[14:41] of like 300 hours to learn how to code
[14:44] the reason those courses are so long is
[14:46] because they are main for people who
[14:47] want to have a job and since the job
[14:49] market is a zero sum game which means
[14:52] that if your neighbor gets the job you
[14:53] won't get the job you have to compete on
[14:56] who has the most skills so in this case
[14:58] it makes sense to to learn as much as
[15:00] you can so you can compete better
[15:01] against others but the thing is in my
[15:03] case I only care about making tiny
[15:05] websites on the internet I just want to
[15:07] be me my computer a few of my customers
[15:09] and that's it I'm not I don't intend to
[15:11] build a massive app for millions of
[15:13] people that requires a team of software
[15:15] engineer to handle and because of that
[15:17] those courses here are like a pain for
[15:19] me I don't want to go over 300 hours of
[15:22] content and this is how I came up with
[15:24] this idea of a course that would teach
[15:26] people only the minimum the the those
[15:29] core skills needed in order to build a
[15:31] tiny internet business and just like
[15:34] this I had one marketing angle that set
[15:36] me apart from all the other alternative
[15:38] and on top of that I remember when I
[15:40] learned how to code it was a pain to
[15:42] search for what should I learn what is
[15:45] Javascript what is HTML how those those
[15:47] thing combine together what is a back
[15:48] end what is a front end I had to think
[15:50] about how the the entire thing works
[15:53] what I did with cast is I bundled
[15:55] everything I explained uh students how
[15:57] to go from literally zero to an actual
[16:00] finished product is not about a specific
[16:02] part on the journey it's about the
[16:04] entire Journey which I bet is one of the
[16:06] reason the launch was so successful and
[16:08] then there is another one mistake that I
[16:10] see lots of people making my friend Yuri
[16:12] asked me what would you do with the
[16:14] money and then it made me think okay if
[16:17] I don't have to work for money what
[16:18] would I do with it and I realized that
[16:20] actually I want to build an alternate
[16:22] school for kids who were not good at
[16:24] school or for people who just don't feel
[16:27] like life Clicks in in general like like
[16:30] finding a job or like working for a big
[16:32] company or whatever for people who just
[16:33] you know want the freedom of not being
[16:35] dependent on others just have a computer
[16:37] and be free that is for some reason what
[16:40] is driving me and if you look at the
[16:41] Journey of everything I built everything
[16:44] resonate with what I want to do what
[16:46] goal I want to achieve now if we look
[16:48] with one of my very first product which
[16:51] was called viral buts it's a little
[16:52] software that uh that made my first
[16:54] internet dollar and then somehow let me
[16:57] move to Bal because he was making a
[16:58] little bit of money here I was helping
[17:00] escape room businesses get more money it
[17:02] was like a marketing tool for businesses
[17:04] and he worked he made a couple thousand
[17:06] per month but it did not resonate with
[17:08] me I have close to zero care for the
[17:11] escap room businesses I I don't
[17:13] specially care about them I care about
[17:14] people who want to do s with their
[17:16] computers but a business I'm not so sure
[17:19] and these product never really took off
[17:21] because once again it was not align with
[17:24] things I do things I like and I see lots
[17:26] of people out there who again are trying
[17:28] to combine uh this tech for that market
[17:31] but they don't care about the tech they
[17:32] don't care about the market and they try
[17:34] to make something out of that but I feel
[17:36] like there's a sort of like a a power
[17:38] that knows how much the product resonate
[17:40] with you what is the fit from the thuner
[17:43] and the product and I think if you want
[17:45] to get reach you have to do something
[17:47] that aligns with yourself okay now
[17:49] talking about marketing um of course
[17:51] having an audience on Twitter and
[17:52] YouTube really helps launching products
[17:55] but uh if you can see here this tweet
[17:56] got 1.3 th000 likes this is the only
[17:59] promotion I've done for the course and
[18:02] it would never ever get half a million
[18:05] views if I didn't have make this video
[18:08] here it's a skit where I play morphus in
[18:12] Matrix and I try to convince Neo Who
[18:15] currently has a 9 to5 job to quit his
[18:17] job and learn to code for himself the
[18:19] reason I did this is first because I
[18:21] absolutely love making this kind of
[18:22] videos but also because it works well
[18:25] it's like an ad that's pleasurable to
[18:27] watch and even though you're not necess
[18:29] interested in what I have to sell you
[18:30] might want to share this to a friend
[18:32] because it's fun and that's how this
[18:34] tweet went viral and got half a million
[18:36] views the launch part of your product is
[18:39] very important you want to uh craft
[18:41] everything to be perfect when you launch
[18:43] and just like in real life where
[18:45] conversion rate matters that improve the
[18:47] actual conversion rate of the product so
[18:49] even though you don't have an audience
[18:51] you can play around with writing a
[18:53] beautiful story of how you came up with
[18:54] this product idea you can go on figma
[18:57] and create a beautiful chart that
[18:58] explains your product you can make
[19:00] something that gives a good first
[19:02] impression for your product okay now I'm
[19:04] talking about what is next for cut fast
[19:07] uh at the moment I'm recovering from my
[19:09] sickness I couldn't work for the past 3
[19:11] days I've set up an affiliate program
[19:14] where um people can uh become Affiliates
[19:17] and then they would earn 30 30 to 30%
[19:20] commission to 50% commission uh since
[19:23] the conversion rate is really good on
[19:24] the site Affiliates are already making
[19:26] lots of money at the moment I think
[19:27] they're making over $1,000 per day I
[19:29] added this little uh slider here that
[19:31] gives an idea of how much money you can
[19:33] make if you get I don't know let's say
[19:35] five people trying the course you can
[19:37] make actually 300 bucks and at the same
[19:40] time I am trying Facebook ads so uh the
[19:42] campaign has been running for just a
[19:44] couple days I think the first day
[19:45] Facebook was learning who is the
[19:47] audience and then now the results are
[19:49] pretty impressive yesterday was $60 per
[19:52] purchase today is $13 per purchase which
[19:54] is extremely good really actually really
[19:57] really really good uh it's early to tell
[20:00] how far they would go for now I'm only
[20:01] spending I think uh $70 per day for The
[20:04] Campaign which is not uh much but I
[20:06] think in this case it's worth the try
[20:07] because the product converts really well
[20:09] and I've had luck with ship fast in the
[20:12] past where I would spend $50 and get
[20:14] $150 uh in revenue for this I am not
[20:17] alone my good friend Nico janen is
[20:19] helping me run those ads is excellent at
[20:22] Facebook ads and he buil this little
[20:24] guide here called makers guide uh which
[20:27] I vot and it's excellent it teaches you
[20:29] everything you need to know to make good
[20:31] ads on Facebook so if you have a product
[20:34] that you think is worth sharing through
[20:35] ads definitely check it out it's a
[20:37] masterpiece and then as soon as I'm
[20:39] recovered I am going to work on the AI
[20:42] teacher so I want to train an AI on the
[20:44] course so it knows the captions it knows
[20:47] where the student is in the course at
[20:49] the moment it knows the code of the
[20:51] course and is able to help the students
[20:53] learn whether it's explain things or
[20:55] debug when students are stuck I guess
[20:57] I'll will need a little bit more of
[20:58] those Ginger
[21:03] cheese we're so back oh my God spent an
[21:07] entire week I was sick and it's the
[21:09] first night of sleep where I sleep
