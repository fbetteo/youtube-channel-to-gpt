[00:00] by the end of this video you would have
[00:01] built a billion doll software and get
[00:03] acquired by Google so you can spend the
[00:04] rest of your life testing out every new
[00:06] trendy Tex tax all right I'm not so sure
[00:09] about all that but my promise is this at
[00:11] the end of this video you'll know
[00:12] exactly how to use the platform product
[00:13] tant in order to drive traffic to your
[00:15] website and grow your startups and
[00:17] you'll see that it doesn't require any
[00:19] prior experience or doesn't cost any
[00:20] money but why should you trust me well I
[00:22] got the maker of the Year award in 2023
[00:25] I launched 21 products on product hunt
[00:27] in the last two to three years and I got
[00:30] 13 Awards and you will see that at the
[00:31] beginning I didn't get anything and then
[00:33] it got easier and easier so there are
[00:35] some knowledge that you can reuse to
[00:37] replicate the same let's go all right
[00:38] first product tun 101 and is it worth
[00:40] launching your startup there there's
[00:42] about 4 million visitors on the site
[00:44] every month and it's high quality
[00:46] traffic there are a bunch of designers
[00:48] programmers agency solopreneurs so uh
[00:50] the eyeballs you're getting there are
[00:52] very good if you end up in the top
[00:53] product of the day you can expect 2 to
[00:55] 3,000 visitors just from the platform
[00:57] but it's not it they also have one of
[00:58] the biggest Tech news Lor out there so
[01:01] if you end up in the top 5 to 10 product
[01:03] of the day you will also get shared
[01:05] somewhere there and you will add another
[01:07] extra thousands or 2,000 visitors to
[01:09] your site and finally there are a bunch
[01:10] of media that feed off product hunt
[01:12] because this is where the new trendy
[01:14] Tech happens so after the launch when
[01:16] the traffic goes down you'll see some
[01:18] spikes coming from other platforms and
[01:20] product tant is very famous so overall
[01:22] it's a very good investment for your
[01:23] startup all right if you haven't
[01:25] launched on product hun here is roughly
[01:26] how it works every 24 hours there is a
[01:28] new bunch of product that are displayed
[01:30] on the homepage of the platform and
[01:31] they're competing to get the most of
[01:33] votes the timer resits at midnight PST
[01:36] and for the first 4 hours there is no
[01:38] ranking based on ofos it's just purely
[01:40] random to avoid the winner takes all
[01:43] after the fifth hour the products start
[01:44] to rank based on their number of up
[01:46] votes and so it's a winner takes all
[01:48] game and if you're at the top you're
[01:50] almost guaranteed to stay around the top
[01:51] and if you're at the bottom it's very
[01:52] hard to claim up that's why the first
[01:54] four hours are the most important and in
[01:56] this video we're going to cover how to
[01:57] get the most up votes during this time
[01:59] there are two ways to get up votes on
[02:01] product tant and first is called the
[02:03] inbound upvotes the up votes that are
[02:05] coming from users who are actually
[02:07] browsing the platform and they find your
[02:10] listing and they decide to up vote it on
[02:12] the product hunt home feed there are
[02:13] tons of other products competing against
[02:15] yours for attention and the way you win
[02:17] is by nailing three things your name
[02:19] your tagline and your logo the name of
[02:21] your startup should be short simple and
[02:23] very easy to read and you would rather
[02:25] ditch uh like VC style names like stripe
[02:27] or Tesla and go for something very logic
[02:29] IAL like ship fast a tool to ship fast
[02:32] if you want a tutorial to make names for
[02:35] products I wrote a short article about
[02:37] finding good names for startups as a
[02:39] solopreneur in the blog in the
[02:41] description below next is your tagline
[02:43] and it's the most important part of your
[02:45] listing it should be very short like 60
[02:47] to 70 characters maximum it should be
[02:49] one sentence and it should tell exactly
[02:51] why would a random stranger on the
[02:53] internet invest its precious time for
[02:55] your product it shouldn't be about your
[02:56] product but it should be about what it's
[02:58] doing for your customers uh what pain is
[03:00] it relieving how their life would be
[03:02] after they try your product why is it
[03:03] worth their time and finally your logo
[03:05] this is more the creative part that is
[03:07] up to you but if you see that there are
[03:09] many logos that are blue colors maybe go
[03:11] for a green that contrast well you want
[03:12] to stand out and be remarkable now if
[03:14] users decided to click on your listing
[03:16] there's two more important parts the
[03:18] first one is your Carousel of photos you
[03:20] can put I think up to seven eight maybe
[03:22] even 10 the first three matters and what
[03:25] matters too is that you keep those
[03:26] images super simple one image should be
[03:29] about one feature and if you want to add
[03:31] a screenshot of your product this is a
[03:32] very good thing but do not add the
[03:34] entire dashboard of your users for
[03:36] instance make sure that you zoom on
[03:38] those photos and you show only a very
[03:40] tiny part of your software as if the
[03:42] user was actually looking at uh your
[03:44] software very very close cuz nobody
[03:46] would read the text that's inside unless
[03:48] it's a big headline and the last
[03:50] important part of this puzzle is the
[03:52] first comments you the funer are going
[03:54] to write your little story how you ended
[03:57] up with this product ID as the first com
[04:00] on your listing this is very important
[04:01] because people relate with people and
[04:03] stories you are not a VC back company
[04:06] with millions of dollars for marketing
[04:08] who just want to make even more money
[04:09] you are a nice person who just want to
[04:11] quit their 9 to5 and you have a story to
[04:14] tell so explain why you came up with
[04:15] this product ID explain what it engag
[04:17] for you how much time you invested in it
[04:19] and the comment section supports
[04:21] markdown so you can add links for
[04:23] instance to your products so if people
[04:24] are browsing the comments you can
[04:26] directly link them to your product as
[04:27] well as link your social media if if you
[04:29] have a YouTube channel or if you're
[04:31] writing your journey on Twitter make
[04:32] sure you add a link to that part so they
[04:34] can start growing a little following
[04:36] that's going to be very helpful for the
[04:38] next part all right now the second way
[04:39] to get up votes is through outbound up
[04:42] votes it's basically anyone who is not
[04:44] currently on the product on platform but
[04:46] decides to come and help you for
[04:47] instance when I got started I would send
[04:49] my product link to all my family and
[04:51] friends and ask them for up votes but
[04:53] there are many other more reliable way
[04:55] the first one is Twitter Twitter and
[04:56] product hunt have a good audience
[04:58] overlap there are tons of solopreneurs
[05:00] on Twitter who have a producton account
[05:02] and they will be happy to help you and
[05:03] then it boils down to making good tweets
[05:06] so learn the basic of writing how to
[05:08] make a tweet that's easy to read learn
[05:09] how to make a good headline that catch
[05:11] people attention learn how to tell your
[05:13] story in a nice way that people can
[05:14] relate learn how to make good creative
[05:16] that will gets people attention for me
[05:17] it all started with fun launch videos
[05:20] back then I had a few hundred followers
[05:22] on Twitter and I would make those videos
[05:23] where I would go on a fake podcast with
[05:26] jogan or I would go in a movie with
[05:28] Leonardo DiCaprio and this felt like me
[05:30] it was fun to make and some people on
[05:32] Twitter enjoyed it so they started to
[05:34] watch the video up both my product on
[05:36] listing and also reshare the link that
[05:38] really helped me boost the product on
[05:40] launch and that's also how I grew an
[05:41] audience I actually made a little course
[05:43] about how I make those videos if you
[05:44] want to check it it's in the description
[05:46] it might sound a little bit discouraging
[05:47] if you're getting started and you don't
[05:49] have an audience yet but remember an
[05:51] audience is not created out of thin air
[05:53] people follow you for a reason and that
[05:55] reason is because you might be the guy
[05:57] who launched a bunch of products on
[05:58] product hunt so you got to start
[06:00] somewhere build the audience or build
[06:01] the products start with the products
[06:03] launch things on product T and this is
[06:05] how you're going to get people follow
[06:07] you on Twitter that later will help you
[06:09] achieve more momentum for every new
[06:11] product hunt launches and of course if
[06:13] you're active on any other social media
[06:14] Facebook Instagram Tik Tok wherever this
[06:16] is you are make sure to share the links
[06:18] to your producton listing there to get
[06:20] some votes another way to drive out bone
[06:22] up votes is through your actual users
[06:24] let's say you have launched a product
[06:26] already and you have 100 active daily
[06:28] users or something like that you can
[06:29] tell them through mailing list or
[06:31] anything that you can reach out to them
[06:33] to help you support the product on
[06:34] launch if they're your users they
[06:36] probably already love you and it's going
[06:37] to drive some more upvotes to your
[06:39] producton listing and finally you want
[06:41] to add a badge to your website a little
[06:43] Banner top left bottom right wherever
[06:45] this is you think fits well that says oh
[06:48] we are live on product hunt for the next
[06:49] 24 hours we would love your support that
[06:51] is very helpful for two reasons first
[06:52] the product hunt users who clicked your
[06:54] websites and are now visiting your
[06:56] leting page it's a good way to bring
[06:57] them back to the platform to give you an
[06:59] extra up and second you can launch your
[07:01] startups on many other platforms at the
[07:02] same time you can launch on Hacker News
[07:04] Reddit Twitter at the same time and you
[07:06] can get extra traffic from those
[07:08] platforms when they see the badge on
[07:09] producton some of them will come and
[07:11] give you a little hands and up vote your
[07:13] producton listing this is what I do all
[07:15] the time I scheduled the product hunt
[07:17] launch and I would launch on every other
[07:19] platform so it brings an extra juice to
[07:21] product hunt and if you want to know how
[07:22] to launch on those other platforms I
[07:24] wrote a little something on my blog in
[07:25] the description okay now you might be
[07:27] convinced it's a good time for you to
[07:28] launch your startups but which day
[07:30] should you actually launch it depends on
[07:31] what you want if you want social proof
[07:33] or traffic if you want traffic Mondays
[07:35] to Fridays are usually the busiest
[07:37] busiest in terms of traffic people
[07:38] actually browsing the site but also
[07:40] busier in terms of competition so it's
[07:42] harder to get an award but it's easier
[07:43] to get traffic and since VC startups
[07:46] don't work on Monday at midnight I
[07:48] recommend you to start launching on
[07:49] Monday instead if you're looking for
[07:50] social proof and you want to get that
[07:52] product tant badge to embade on your
[07:53] site I recommend you to launch on
[07:55] weekends and especially Sundays are
[07:57] usually the calest days so you have
[07:59] let's competition and more chance to get
[08:00] the badge is your product ready to be
[08:02] launched on product well based on the
[08:04] T-shirt I'm pretty sure that you can
[08:05] guess I'll tell you it's time to launch
[08:07] it but I would argue that you should
[08:08] wait until you have at least some
[08:10] testimonials on your site before
[08:12] launching the reason is simple there
[08:13] will be tons of new people discovering
[08:15] your products so you want to make sure
[08:16] you have some kind of social proof
[08:18] because it's much easier to sell a
[08:20] product if people are already validating
[08:22] it and keep in mind that you can still
[08:24] relaunch your product a few month later
[08:26] and you can also launch some free tools
[08:28] to promote your main products so don't
[08:29] hesitate to launch as soon as you have
[08:31] social proof the first product on launch
[08:33] is hard and might not go as you expected
[08:35] but it's a necessary step if you're
[08:37] serious about becoming a solopreneur
[08:39] quitting your 9 to5 and become
[08:41] financially independent it's a tiny step
[08:43] that's going to help you in the future
[08:44] you're going to start growing a little
[08:45] audience on Twitter because people will
[08:47] admire you for launching your product so
[08:48] the next time you launch a product you
[08:50] can ask your audience to help you out
[08:51] which is going to grow a bigger audience
[08:53] and it's going to be like a little Loop
[08:55] that's going to keep going up and up and
[08:56] up and you'll see that after a couple of
[08:58] launches you're almost guaranted gued to
[08:59] have one of the product tant badge and
[09:01] you will as well get a couple hundred if
[09:03] not thousand visitors on your side and
[09:05] grown a little audience so my advice is
[09:07] to not overthink it just launch it and
[09:09] keep repeating the same recipe over and
[09:11] over until luck finds you all right
[09:13] that's it for this video if you liked it
[09:15] you can like the video and if you're
[09:16] looking for other ways to Market your
[09:18] startup I drop a link to my blog below
[09:20] where there are many other uh free ways
[09:21] to Market uh your startup and G
[09:23] customers and until the next video I
[09:25] hope you just launch it
