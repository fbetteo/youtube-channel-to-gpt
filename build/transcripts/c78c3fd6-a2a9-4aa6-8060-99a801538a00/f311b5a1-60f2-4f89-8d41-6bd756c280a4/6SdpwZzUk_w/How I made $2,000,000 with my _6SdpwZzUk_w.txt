[00:00] most people think you need to spend
[00:01] thousands of dollars in ads or have a
[00:03] huge audience in order to get customers
[00:05] and this is completely wrong 3 years ago
[00:07] I was broke I had no following and no
[00:09] idea how to get customers I was also
[00:11] desperate so I tried every marketing
[00:12] channels I could find today 10 of those
[00:15] marketing channels are making money for
[00:16] my product every single day some brought
[00:18] in $10,000 some brought millions and
[00:21] most of them are actually free and
[00:22] easier to use than you think so in this
[00:24] video I'm going to show you the 10
[00:25] marketing channels that worked for me so
[00:27] you can use them too to get customers
[00:29] let's Dive In let's start with the most
[00:30] underrated marketing channels out there
[00:33] called Outreach it cost almost $0 it
[00:36] requires a little bit of effort but
[00:37] nothing too crazy in the return on
[00:39] investment is great this is how I grew
[00:41] this uh software business to over
[00:43] $80,000 in Revenue I have another PayPal
[00:45] account with uh over $10,000 there and I
[00:47] did not spend a single Dollar on it and
[00:50] back then it was 2018 I knew nothing
[00:52] about marketing I'm not even English
[00:54] native and yet I managed to use cod
[00:56] emails in order to grow this business to
[00:58] this Revenue the reason 99% of people
[01:00] don't get results with code Outreach is
[01:02] because they're trying to sell a product
[01:03] when actually what you want to do is to
[01:05] get a reply from the person and open a
[01:07] conversation for instance this is an
[01:09] example of a terrible Cod Outreach not
[01:11] personalize how are you I know you don't
[01:13] care about how I feel then pitching me
[01:15] your product with a bunch of Tes and
[01:17] unclear Cod to action instead of doing
[01:19] this let's talk about how you can get
[01:20] the most out of cold Outreach to grow
[01:23] your startup first you will need to find
[01:25] lead a lead is basically a contact of a
[01:27] potential customer so it includes email
[01:30] um could be the name of the person and
[01:32] some extra information so you want to go
[01:34] where you can find all of your potential
[01:35] customers that could be Trip Advisor
[01:37] Yelp Twitter wherever your customers
[01:39] hang out you want to go there in my case
[01:40] I'm going to pretend I'm selling a
[01:41] software for escape room businesses what
[01:43] you want to do here is you want to
[01:44] collect information about each of your
[01:46] customers so let's take an escape room
[01:48] business and you want to find something
[01:49] very important you want to find the name
[01:51] of the business owner now it's not
[01:53] always R return everywhere but one good
[01:55] place to find it is in the reviews
[01:57] sometime there replies to reviews from
[01:59] people looks like in this case they
[02:00] didn't reply so what you want to do in
[02:01] this case would be to look for terrible
[02:03] reviews you apply those filters because
[02:06] usually the business owner would tend to
[02:07] reped so in this case you would see that
[02:09] for instance um here we have Victor who
[02:12] replied for the business and say you can
[02:14] feel free to reach out to our manager
[02:16] and you have even better you have the
[02:18] email the personal email of the manager
[02:20] okay then you want to download a little
[02:22] uh CRM for Gmail or whatever email box
[02:24] you're using so I used to use streak so
[02:26] it's like a little pipeline that you
[02:28] plug into Gmail and you can have
[02:30] multiple stages so the first stage will
[02:32] be lead so the person you haven't
[02:33] contacted yet so you put those contacts
[02:35] there first and then you have stage one
[02:37] after sending one email stage two after
[02:39] a follow-up email if they didn't reply
[02:41] to the first one stage three stage four
[02:42] Etc and then you want to do something
[02:44] very simple you want to send code email
[02:46] that are well crafted so this is an
[02:48] example of of email that I used to send
[02:50] that got uh 50% open rate and 10% reply
[02:53] rate and this is the entire strategy
[02:55] here on how I grew a software to 80,000
[02:57] in Revenue if you want to write a good
[02:59] code you have to make it super short
[03:01] like three sentences and you want to
[03:02] follow some kind of structure so for
[03:04] instance in this case I open the email
[03:07] with the subject line that's first
[03:09] mention the name of the business owner
[03:10] and second is about the benefit they
[03:12] will get with my product and not my
[03:14] product itself then I make it personal
[03:16] by again saying the name of the business
[03:17] owner then I create I show them that
[03:19] there is an opportunity like they're
[03:21] missing out something they're missing
[03:22] out potential customers I create a
[03:24] little curiosity cap that talking about
[03:26] these like mini games Bots that people
[03:28] like to share the hopefully that make
[03:30] them curious and the the emails end with
[03:32] a simple call traction I don't ask them
[03:34] to visit my website I don't ask them to
[03:36] book a call I just asked them to respond
[03:39] to this email if they want to learn more
[03:40] details if they don't reply I'll add
[03:42] them to the next stage follow up two to
[03:44] three days later and then one last
[03:45] followup maybe a week later and then
[03:47] move on and this is the how I grow this
[03:50] like little software business from0 to
[03:52] $80,000 I was back then I was selling a
[03:55] um monthly subscription to access to the
[03:58] software for 1999 per month if I send 20
[04:00] call emails per day two would reply one
[04:02] would subscribe I would add one new
[04:04] customer for 199 months per day to be
[04:06] honest it's a bit of a boring strategy
[04:07] it's not super fun but if you do it
[04:09] properly it works it is the fastest way
[04:12] to make money on the internet okay let's
[04:13] talk about free tools this is by far my
[04:16] favorite marketing channel the cost is
[04:19] free the A4 reord is kind of minimal and
[04:22] the return investment is great it's
[04:24] great that it's also good for promoting
[04:25] literally anything you want to sell on
[04:27] the internet if you're a developer or if
[04:28] you're learning how to code code this
[04:30] will fulfill your inner dreams uh so
[04:32] what is a free tool so let's assume that
[04:34] here you have a paid SAS or a paid
[04:36] product or whatever this is and you want
[04:38] to create Standalone free mini apps that
[04:41] are promotion for your paid app so a
[04:43] good example of this is logo fast this
[04:45] is a little tool for people to create uh
[04:48] icons and logos for their startups and
[04:50] what I do is on the right side I have a
[04:53] promotion for my coding course because I
[04:55] assume that if you're looking to make a
[04:56] logo for a website you might want to
[04:58] learn how to build a website as well
[05:00] this app that I built in 3 days made
[05:02] over $110,000 in revenue for my product
[05:04] and in the past 30 days only there are
[05:07] 583 people who visited my websit through
[05:10] this free tool now how do you find ideas
[05:12] for free tools the first one is to
[05:14] extract a paid feature from your your
[05:17] paid product so a good example of this
[05:19] is tweet Hunter it's a paid tool to help
[05:21] people write better on Twitter and grow
[05:23] on audience and they created this like
[05:25] generate tweet thing where you can just
[05:27] type the name of the person the hashtag
[05:29] of the person you want to tweet like and
[05:30] it's going to generate a bunch of tweets
[05:32] as if you're the person and surprise
[05:34] surprise right here there's a little ad
[05:36] for the the actual uh paid tool so they
[05:39] extracted one of their feature and they
[05:40] put it for free on the internet and they
[05:42] use that as an ad for their own product
[05:44] and another way to get free tools idea
[05:46] is to get inside of your customer
[05:48] journey and think about all the previous
[05:50] steps they will have to accomplish in
[05:51] order to use your product or think about
[05:53] using your product here is one of my
[05:55] habit tracker I track my habit like this
[05:58] then I have some numbers Etc
[06:00] one good way to get users is to make
[06:02] them realize what they're going to
[06:04] accomplish in one year if they take
[06:07] their habit every single day so this is
[06:09] why I created this app called visualize
[06:11] habit where you can see one year later
[06:14] how much you will achieve so let's say
[06:15] for instance I want to read 15 minutes
[06:18] three times a week and I want to uh
[06:20] meditate 10 minutes every single day and
[06:23] also because I am a developer I want to
[06:24] code let's say 60 Minutes every single
[06:27] day and when I click next as as a person
[06:30] I would get this like a cute card here
[06:32] where I see that I'm going to read eight
[06:34] books this year I'm going to meditate
[06:36] for 3 days over the next 365 days and
[06:39] now you can see I have this little like
[06:41] how to reach my goal like how do I move
[06:43] on to next step and if I click here then
[06:45] boom I have a promotion for my habits
[06:48] tracker and actually if I click on
[06:50] achieve my goals I created this little
[06:52] system where it's embedded with my habit
[06:54] tracker where I'm going to import all
[06:56] those habits that I thought of and I can
[06:58] directly create an account this way this
[07:00] tool this previous tool got over 10,000
[07:02] visitors in 24 hours when I launched it
[07:04] and I got hundreds and and thousands of
[07:06] users from my hit tracker just like this
[07:08] there are few requirements if you want
[07:09] to make a good free tool the first one
[07:12] of course it has to be 100% free you
[07:15] also want to have just one feature you
[07:16] want to make it extremely simple if you
[07:19] have two features idea in mind made two
[07:20] free tools you want to use a Smart name
[07:23] that could be either a name that people
[07:26] can search for SEO purposes so this is a
[07:28] free tool to gener generate like a user
[07:30] personal for marketing people you can
[07:32] search for like who what type of
[07:34] business you're in and who you're
[07:35] targeting and it's going to create like
[07:37] personels of you know what are typical
[07:39] customers doing this is 100% free and
[07:41] surprise surprise at the bottom there is
[07:43] an ad for their AI marketing platform to
[07:46] help you grow your business and user
[07:48] Persona in the name is likely something
[07:50] that people will search on Google so
[07:51] this is a smart naming another way to
[07:54] name it smart is to just um try to do
[07:57] whatever the product is doing so here
[07:59] logo fast it's a tool to create a logo
[08:01] fast the name is very important because
[08:04] this is what people will search if they
[08:05] see like a Tik Tok video or something
[08:07] they'll search for this on Google so it
[08:09] has to be either extremely simple or
[08:11] research oriented like SEO oriented next
[08:13] one you don't want to have any sign up
[08:16] or any emails or anything you want the
[08:18] product to be accessible right on the
[08:20] homepage without having me as a user do
[08:23] anything and you want to create a sort
[08:24] of a seamless plug uh a seamless plug
[08:27] for instance this one I showed you
[08:28] earlier is very simless because it feels
[08:30] like uh The Habit tracker is The Logical
[08:33] Next Step a bad example of this this is
[08:35] one of my products too is like a top
[08:37] productivity hack that are uh built by
[08:40] the internet so anyone can submit
[08:41] productivity hack and you see at the
[08:43] bottom I have an ad for instance for my
[08:45] course this is just a bad promotion
[08:47] because it looks like an ad once the
[08:49] tool is ready and we're going to cover
[08:51] that in other part of this video uh you
[08:53] want to publish your tool everywhere so
[08:54] Hacker News product hunt like
[08:56] directories Twitter Etc and finally
[08:58] don't over think it just build it ship
[09:00] it and repeat keep making those tools
[09:02] don't spend too much time working on
[09:04] each of those tools just make one great
[09:06] feature launch it and move on how to
[09:08] make money with affiliate marketing the
[09:10] cost is like medium because you'll give
[09:12] a commission to people who refer your
[09:14] product the at for on your site is very
[09:16] minimum and the return on investment is
[09:18] pretty great it's uh good for any
[09:20] product that is working already we're
[09:22] going to cover that later um affiliate
[09:24] marketing is how I made over
[09:26] $50,000 in revenue for some of my
[09:29] products here is how it works you have
[09:31] your paid product whether it's a
[09:32] software course whatever you will get
[09:34] users and some of them are power users
[09:36] they will love your product so much so
[09:38] they will sign up for your affiliate
[09:40] program and they will get a unique link
[09:42] that they can share with their audience
[09:45] and earn a commission whenever someone
[09:47] from Their audience sign up using their
[09:49] link which then will bring more users
[09:51] for your product and get you more
[09:52] affiliate it's very simple to set up
[09:54] there are three steps the first one is
[09:55] you want to find an affiliate software I
[09:58] use rewardful this is not a paid
[10:00] promotion here but I use reward food and
[10:02] I love them it's super easy to integrate
[10:04] with trie I just add a little tracking
[10:05] script to my site and it's all set up
[10:08] then you want to create an SEO page with
[10:10] link and proof so for instance this is
[10:12] one of my affiliate program I I give it
[10:15] an an dedicated page for SEO purposes
[10:17] and then here I am not talking to my
[10:19] customers I am talking to my Affiliates
[10:21] and what Affiliates are looking for and
[10:22] they're looking to make some money on
[10:24] the internet so the copywriting on the
[10:26] page is important and I'm clearly
[10:27] telling them that they can make some
[10:29] money using my affiliate program there
[10:31] are a few elements that matter so for
[10:32] instance here I add this photo as a
[10:34] social proof to show that there's some
[10:36] people already making money with my
[10:38] affiliate program sometimes I add this
[10:40] little uh slider here to give people an
[10:42] idea of you know how much money they
[10:44] could expect based on the number of
[10:46] referrals and I keep adding more social
[10:48] proof to really show that uh if for
[10:50] instance um this affiliate got 167
[10:53] visitors and they earned $358 in
[10:56] commissions I want to show that it is a
[10:58] good a working affiliate program and
[11:01] sometimes I add a little button where
[11:03] they can download brand assets so they
[11:05] can download my logo headlines Etc to
[11:07] make it easier for them to share the
[11:09] affiliate program and finally you want
[11:11] to promote this affiliate program so if
[11:14] you have an audience on social media
[11:15] this is definitely the place you want to
[11:17] promote but sometimes you don't and so
[11:19] what um you can do here is you can
[11:22] promote it inside of your app so the
[11:24] affiliate program I showed you earlier
[11:25] is like a codebase for developers to
[11:27] ship startups faster and on the code
[11:28] base I have this like deployment part
[11:31] where it's like the end you're done with
[11:33] uh the project uh if you scroll at the
[11:35] bottom there like a button to apply to
[11:37] become an affiliate I try to put it at
[11:39] the right time in my customers's journey
[11:41] in order to make it easy for them to
[11:42] sign up for the program another example
[11:44] for instance Jack freaks is a Serial
[11:47] entrepreneur he builds lots of startup
[11:48] and he's using one of my startup to
[11:50] track analytics and of course I have set
[11:53] up an affiliate program for this web
[11:55] analytics startup so that when my users
[11:57] post a screenshot of their Dash board
[11:59] they can also include a link an
[12:01] affiliate link and earn a commission a
[12:03] few requirements here first is do not
[12:06] bother if you don't have a working
[12:07] product already you must be making money
[12:09] with that product this is very important
[12:11] otherwise you're going to lose your time
[12:12] and lose your affiliate time you want to
[12:14] be generous you want to offer at least
[12:16] 30% depending on your margin of course
[12:18] up to 50% one thing you can do if you
[12:20] start building startups is to copy an
[12:22] existing business so you're sure that
[12:24] the market and the product converts
[12:25] already and you can offer an a very
[12:28] generous AFF program like 50% that way
[12:31] if your product is good of course lots
[12:33] of people will jump on your affiliate
[12:34] program and share your product and
[12:36] they'll give you a competitive Advantage
[12:38] uh next you want to ban branded keywords
[12:41] uh of course if someone search for ship
[12:43] fast one of my products and they add
[12:45] Google ads to include their affiliate
[12:47] link uh it doesn't make sense to give
[12:48] them a commission because people were
[12:50] already looking for my product and so
[12:51] what I do here uh I normally would ban
[12:53] them but in this case I just figured out
[12:56] someone is using Google ads to promote
[12:57] chip fast uh so when I click the link
[12:59] and there are like some parameters right
[13:01] here that shows me as a developer that
[13:04] the the the person is coming from a
[13:06] Google paid ad campaign and so I just
[13:08] delete the referral cookie and it will
[13:10] not get any Commission because this is
[13:11] breaking the rules the terms of service
[13:13] of my affiliate program and of course
[13:15] you want to mention that clearly on your
[13:17] affiliate program rules okay one last
[13:20] thing you want to set a 30 days window
[13:23] for the payout minimum because sometimes
[13:25] some Affiliates are not well intentioned
[13:27] they'll sign up for your program they
[13:28] will purchase your product using their
[13:30] own affiliate link which makes them earn
[13:32] a commission and then they will ask for
[13:34] a refund or charge back and they will
[13:36] just earn the commission to avoid this
[13:38] try to set up at least a 30 days window
[13:40] minimum I usually do 60 days for people
[13:43] who are just getting started affiliates
[13:45] with zero commissions and then I slowly
[13:46] increase them to a 30 days window Hacker
[13:49] News is a gold mine to promote your
[13:51] startup I use Hacker News to drive well
[13:53] over 25,000 visitors to all of my site
[13:56] combined it requires $0 on your s very
[13:59] minimal effort like you could literally
[14:01] be up and running in 3 minutes and this
[14:03] is a good return on investment you won't
[14:05] always go viral but if it goes viral it
[14:07] goes viral and it's crazy and it is best
[14:09] for any sorts of like digital product
[14:11] especially if it's for developers or if
[14:13] it's using some kind of new trendy Tech
[14:15] like AI the problem with icon new is
[14:16] that most people don't use it right so
[14:19] those are some of the rules you want to
[14:20] follow in order to get the most out of
[14:22] Icon news and eventually go viral first
[14:24] you need to understand who is on this
[14:26] platform this is very important it is
[14:28] backed by why commer the famous startup
[14:31] incubator so it's the ecosystem of like
[14:33] tech people startup entrepreneurs lots
[14:35] of developers so you can see here on the
[14:37] homepage it is a very TIY nerdy platform
[14:41] this is very important because this is
[14:42] how you're going to shape your message
[14:44] when you're going to post across the
[14:45] platform on The Hacker News website you
[14:47] have a category called show this is the
[14:49] only place you want to promote your
[14:51] startup this is a place made for people
[14:53] like you and I who ship startups on the
[14:54] internet um first you want to submit
[14:57] your project and you want to to write
[14:59] show hn column you always always always
[15:02] want to start with this because this is
[15:04] going to put your post into the show hn
[15:07] category then after posting you're going
[15:09] to end up in the newest the show new or
[15:12] the newest post and if you get like
[15:14] above three four five votes then you're
[15:16] going to be pushed to the main show
[15:18] category and sometimes what can happen
[15:20] it didn't happen to me but what can
[15:21] happen is if you stay at the top of the
[15:23] show Hacker News category for a little
[15:25] while you might even end up on the
[15:26] homepage of Hacker News and now we're
[15:28] talking really big numbers to increase
[15:30] the chance of your post to get voted you
[15:32] want to always start with I made XYZ so
[15:36] for instance those are some of my post
[15:37] as you can see here my very first Hacker
[15:39] News Post uh so show hn I made a movie
[15:43] recommendation app based on your mood
[15:45] here I have zero Karma like it doesn't
[15:47] matter how many followers you have on
[15:48] the platforms it won't help you go viral
[15:50] but if you use the I made you increase
[15:53] the chance because you're telling a
[15:54] story you're telling your story then he
[15:57] wants to have an outcome base what is
[16:00] the tool you made for so for instance
[16:02] here it's a movie recommendation app
[16:03] based on your mood so it's interesting
[16:05] it's like it's an app to recommend your
[16:06] movies another one that went viral is
[16:08] this one with 152 upv it's a habit
[16:10] tracker to fight procrastination again
[16:13] here I'm telling the outcome of why I
[16:15] made the app not just the app itself
[16:17] then you want to use a tech based
[16:20] language remember it's used by
[16:21] developers so you want to be a techy
[16:24] somehow so in this case I use the word
[16:26] gamified which is a bit nerdy I try to
[16:28] use words that are uh Tech and trendy if
[16:31] you need inspiration for your post go to
[16:33] bestof hn.com and it will show you all
[16:36] the best performing post of the show
[16:38] atrian category and you will see that
[16:40] the recing pattern is that it almost
[16:41] always start with I made and then
[16:43] something have created a new type of
[16:45] puzzle I made a site where blah blah
[16:47] blah um this is a recurring pattern and
[16:49] use that as a template to create your
[16:51] own post now to no goes first do not ask
[16:54] for up votes they are moderators on the
[16:56] platform if they see people coming from
[16:58] your uh post link you will get banned
[17:00] instantly so avoid that and you also
[17:02] don't want to use emoji you want to
[17:04] speak Hacker News language they don't
[17:06] use Emoji so don't use emojis and
[17:08] finally if you want to post multiple
[17:09] times on Hacker News you will need to
[17:11] become active because there is a rule
[17:13] that says you can post once you need to
[17:15] engage five times so like post comment
[17:18] on post like show that you're an actual
[17:20] user of Hacker News if you want to post
[17:21] over and over okay you're going to call
[17:23] me crazy on this one but hear me out Cod
[17:25] calls this is the best way to learn
[17:29] marketing if you're in for the long term
[17:31] I would definitely recommend you to give
[17:32] it a try you just pick your phone and
[17:34] you call businesses and you try to pit
[17:35] your product this is extremely hard but
[17:38] you're going to learn so much about
[17:39] human psychology you want to ask tgpt to
[17:42] make a lot of script like a call coding
[17:44] script so um how to open the call uh how
[17:46] to handle some of the objections and
[17:48] then you want to find information about
[17:50] the business you're going to call the
[17:51] name of the business owner the location
[17:53] uh try to find stuff on the internet
[17:54] like I don't know maybe it's from
[17:55] reviews or maybe they're fully booked or
[17:57] something try to find something that
[17:59] will instantly make the person who pick
[18:00] up the phone like oh this guy is
[18:02] interesting I swear this is one of the
[18:04] best way to learn marketing how to use
[18:06] PSO or programmatic SEO to drive traffic
[18:09] to your startups this is how I drove
[18:11] over 50,000 visitors to some of my
[18:14] websites and currently there are like
[18:16] 200 people visiting this site in the
[18:17] past 24 hours 100 people visiting this
[18:19] site in the past 24 hours and 110 people
[18:21] visiting this website what is
[18:23] programmatic SEO it's basically you rank
[18:25] a bunch of longterm longtail keywords on
[18:28] Google so that people discover you
[18:30] through those keywords and they end up
[18:31] on your uh main product page it is one
[18:34] of the best way for developers to bring
[18:36] traffic on autopilot to your website it
[18:38] doesn't cost anything it requires medium
[18:40] medium effort from your side and the
[18:42] return on investment is great this is
[18:45] good for product that have some kind of
[18:46] a search intent how to get started
[18:48] you'll need very basic programming
[18:50] skills so I think you can use AI to
[18:52] create those websites or directories
[18:54] first you want to find a relevant
[18:55] keyword to your business so let's assume
[18:57] that I'm going to make a uh directory
[18:59] for raid room like I want to rank raid
[19:02] rooms like those places where you break
[19:03] stuff I want to add user reviews I want
[19:05] to make it easy for people to find good
[19:07] reviews and good raid rooms around them
[19:09] if I search for raid room inside of this
[19:11] free keyword generator uh tool I will uh
[19:14] disc discover how much traffic there is
[19:16] you can see raid Atlanta raid Room
[19:18] Chicago has a bunch of volume like over
[19:21] a thousand searches and the difficulty
[19:23] the KD so key difficulty is quite easy
[19:26] uh if you use the paid version of Atri
[19:28] you can actually find more details about
[19:30] the exact keyword difficulty and volume
[19:32] uh what you want to do is you want to
[19:34] have one main keyword for which you want
[19:36] to rank and you want to find longer ta
[19:38] keywords so that can be the location
[19:40] that could be skills like beginner
[19:41] Advance Pros Etc it really depends on
[19:43] your business and then you want to build
[19:45] a web page skeleton like sort of like a
[19:47] mod where we're going to stuff keyword
[19:49] in there later for instance this is one
[19:51] of my websites workbook pdf.com and I
[19:53] can see here uh this is the same
[19:55] template I'm reusing for all those pages
[19:58] to be index and Google the only
[19:59] difference is the language that people
[20:02] are going to learn so personalized
[20:03] Japanese workbook personal Ukrainian
[20:05] workbook etc etc now this is a raw
[20:08] example but just to show you what code
[20:10] what it would looks like you would have
[20:11] your HTML tags and you would have like a
[20:13] variables inside of those skeletons so
[20:15] later we're going to step data to have a
[20:17] bunch of like thousands of pages that
[20:19] look different even though they have the
[20:21] same skeleton and then you want to
[20:22] collect and stuff these data so one good
[20:25] place to uh do that is you can go on
[20:27] fivr you can hire someone who uh would
[20:29] go on websites and just collect all the
[20:31] data that you need or you can also scrap
[20:33] the web yourself if you want to that
[20:35] will require Advanced developing skills
[20:37] and then you want to optimize your web
[20:39] page skeleton for SEO so you want to
[20:41] make sure that your images have the
[20:43] right out attributes you want to make
[20:45] sure that your links are titles you want
[20:47] to make sure you stuff the important
[20:49] keywords in the H1 tag you want to make
[20:51] sure you're clean on the SEO side and
[20:53] the last part is to get backlinks back
[20:55] links are like uh other websites linking
[20:57] to your site which going to tell Google
[20:59] that your site is trustworthy a good
[21:02] place to get back links for free is to
[21:04] use product hunts you're going to get
[21:06] one backlink you can also use my Indie
[21:08] page website if you create your
[21:10] portfolio and you'd add links to your
[21:12] website you're going to get a nice
[21:13] backlink and the last part to increase a
[21:15] little bit the speed at which you're
[21:16] going to get index is to submit your
[21:18] site on the search console so just enter
[21:20] some of your URLs here as Google to
[21:23] index it as soon as possible and then
[21:25] you just have to wait as you can see
[21:26] here for this site it took mon mon until
[21:29] they start to take off and if you have
[21:30] done your work properly you're going to
[21:31] get consistent traffic over the years
[21:34] next on the line we have meta ads
[21:36] Instagram Facebook ads this is how I drw
[21:39] for these little websites over I think
[21:41] was it 400 Facebook and 300 like I think
[21:44] there's around 1,000 visitors a months
[21:46] visiting my site and last month I spent
[21:48] around $14,000 for that the cost per
[21:51] purchase was around $48 so I made around
[21:54] $6,000 from ads last month the return
[21:57] investment can be great uh if you're a
[21:59] developer like me and you're not a big
[22:00] fan of ads the effort can be significant
[22:02] and the cost as most ads usually it's
[22:04] quite significant it works for pretty
[22:06] much anything but you want to make sure
[22:08] you have a product that is already
[22:10] converting just like affiliate programs
[22:12] um setting ads is actually pretty simple
[22:14] first you want to install the pixel so
[22:15] this little uh tracking script on your
[22:17] site you can actually install the
[22:19] extension called meta pixel helper to
[22:21] see if it's on a website so this is one
[22:23] of my websites for instance and uh there
[22:25] is actually the metap pixel install
[22:27] tracking page views this is how how you
[22:28] let Facebook knows that people who click
[22:30] on their Facebook ads actually end up
[22:32] visiting the site then you want to
[22:34] manually track some information for me I
[22:36] make it very simple because I don't have
[22:38] uh I don't like ads so I don't want to
[22:40] spend too much time on ads so I just
[22:41] track payments so whenever someone end
[22:43] up making a purchase on my site they
[22:45] redirected to a uh I think this SLC
[22:48] course page and right here I would send
[22:50] Facebook a little even let's say someone
[22:52] purchased and then you want to start
[22:53] launching your C your campaign on the
[22:56] Facebook meta ads manager so there are
[22:58] two things that are important the
[22:59] targeting so who is going to see this ad
[23:02] um there are two important Notions in
[23:03] marketing knowing like a cold audience
[23:05] and a warm audience a warm audience
[23:07] could be someone who know you through
[23:08] social media could be someone who has
[23:10] visited your website Etc and call these
[23:12] people who have never heard of you and
[23:13] of course it's much easier to sell to a
[23:15] warm audience but the data set is also
[23:18] much more limited because it's only
[23:19] people who know you already so if you're
[23:21] in doubt the best way to get started is
[23:23] to do retargeting so Target only people
[23:25] who have already visited your sites so
[23:27] they're somehow familiar with your brand
[23:28] and your ads will convert better and
[23:30] then you want to do creative like you
[23:31] want to create like uh images and photos
[23:34] and videos uh for instance this is one
[23:37] of my ad on mobile it looks like this so
[23:40] there is a first like the copy and then
[23:42] there is the the image itself I am lucky
[23:44] one of my good friend who is much much
[23:46] much better at me than as Nico is
[23:48] helping me he build some cool stuff for
[23:50] people who are learning how to make as
[23:51] like a little guide to learn how to do
[23:53] it um the right way if you want to check
[23:55] this out and then for the image and this
[23:57] is very important because this is what's
[23:59] going to catch the attention um you want
[24:01] to make sure you use templates that are
[24:03] already working you don't need to
[24:05] reinvent the wheel you don't need to
[24:06] start with a blank template uh you want
[24:07] to find stuff on the internet that works
[24:09] those are some of the ad I run uh you
[24:11] can find like libraries and templates
[24:13] everywhere on the internet you have this
[24:15] famous one where you have like this note
[24:16] iOS note app the famous Drake meme Etc
[24:20] you want to make sure you don't start
[24:21] from scratch and one really good place
[24:23] to get started is to just make a
[24:25] screenshot right now of this YouTube
[24:26] video Steal this ad add what your
[24:28] competitors are doing uh the wrong way
[24:30] this way and add what you're doing the
[24:32] right way here and this could be a
[24:34] perfect add for your product building a
[24:36] personal brand this will cost you $0 but
[24:39] it will cost you a lot of time but on
[24:41] the flip side it's probably what will
[24:43] bring the most return on investments not
[24:46] only marketing wise but also from a
[24:48] personal standpoint you can meet friends
[24:50] you can discover cool people you can
[24:51] organize Meetup up all across the world
[24:53] with your followers uh this is probably
[24:54] one of the best thing I have done so far
[24:56] I grow this Twitter audience to 160
[24:58] follow 60,000 followers in the past 3
[25:00] years last year I decided to start
[25:02] YouTube and I grow a YouTube channel to
[25:04] 120,000 followers and this has brought
[25:06] thousands of tens of thousands of
[25:09] visitors to my website if we exclude
[25:11] direct known Twitter is the Second
[25:13] Source that's bringing most of the
[25:14] traffic to my startups building a
[25:16] personal brand could be a 2 hours long
[25:19] video so I'm going to try to keep this
[25:20] very short and give you the main
[25:22] highlight and some of the mistakes I see
[25:24] people make the first one is you want to
[25:25] pick your favorite platform if you see
[25:27] for instance on my Instagram account I
[25:29] barely have uh any follower it is
[25:31] because I am not active on Instagram
[25:33] because I am not good with photos I
[25:34] don't enjoy in the daily life taking
[25:36] photos I find better to write text
[25:38] because my I have a bunch of thoughts
[25:40] and text is a is a good way for me to
[25:41] put on my thoughts you want to find the
[25:43] platform that fits you if you're young
[25:44] if you're used to Tik Tok and YouTube
[25:46] shorts you want to start creating those
[25:48] kind of like short format videos if
[25:49] you're good with photos and you have
[25:51] like a beautiful camera to make like
[25:52] photos are very uh nice you want to
[25:54] build your audience on on Instagram
[25:56] first find what is right for you number
[25:58] two you want to find your unique
[26:00] personality trait we are all unique in
[26:02] some way sometimes even something that
[26:04] you think is not a good thing like you
[26:06] might think like you're overactive or or
[26:09] you're you cannot focus on something but
[26:11] this you can turn this into your
[26:12] strengths for instance I struggle to
[26:14] focus too much on one thing and that is
[26:17] somehow my strengths because then that
[26:18] makes me create a bunch of websites and
[26:21] stuff like I get bored very quickly and
[26:22] I really want to move on to the next one
[26:24] and this is how I build my entire
[26:26] Twitter account under the ship guy the
[26:28] guy who ship a lot of startups if you
[26:31] look at Famous personalities out there
[26:33] like whether it's the rock or artist Etc
[26:36] they all have something unique you want
[26:38] to find what is yours and double down on
[26:40] that then you want to craft your entire
[26:42] profile just around this unique
[26:44] personality trait for instance mine here
[26:46] uh shows all the websites that I work on
[26:49] I don't even need to write a sentence
[26:51] it's just I am the guy who ships lots of
[26:52] websites that's it and of course your uh
[26:55] Banner uh profile pictures the way you
[26:57] write Etc everything have to somehow
[26:59] match your profile and your personality
[27:01] traits then first if you have like
[27:02] literally zero followers the first thing
[27:04] you want to do before writing or
[27:05] creating content is to actually consume
[27:07] content so you want to follow creators
[27:09] that you admire you want to immerse
[27:12] yourself inside of the culture you want
[27:13] to learn the language learn the codes
[27:15] that is going to help you write content
[27:17] then when you want to start writing
[27:18] content and depending on you know what
[27:19] kind of business and what kind of things
[27:21] you're building uh you want to share
[27:22] behind the scenes so um there just a
[27:24] photo of me on my laptop and say today I
[27:26] did this you want to share r results I
[27:28] just got my first customers with a nice
[27:30] screenshot of your stripe dashboard you
[27:31] want to share learnings you want each of
[27:33] your uh content created to have one
[27:35] outcome at least for me I remember at
[27:37] the beginning I had like a bunch of
[27:38] thoughts and I wanted to share this and
[27:40] this and that you want to make sure that
[27:42] you try to organize your thoughts and
[27:43] you try to ask yourself it's like is
[27:45] this a behindth scene content is this
[27:48] like a result oriented inspirational
[27:49] tweet is it like a more of an
[27:51] educational tweet with learnings try to
[27:53] make one piece of content per outcome
[27:55] you want and finally and this is very
[27:57] important if you're getting started try
[27:58] to use template it is scary to look at a
[28:01] bling page and like what am I going to
[28:03] write about for instance this is one of
[28:05] my tweet that perform well and you can
[28:06] see here this is an actual template I
[28:08] saw someone making a similar post for
[28:10] writers and I was like oh this is quite
[28:12] interesting and so I reuse that template
[28:15] 1 hour of this 1 hour of that one hour
[28:17] of that do this every days of the years
[28:18] and by 2026 you would have outcome and
[28:22] not saying that you should write
[28:23] everything in template you also want to
[28:24] sound like an actual human but it is
[28:27] great to uh look at what's working for
[28:29] other creators and try to see how you
[28:31] can use that as a template and add your
[28:34] own signature to it and finally remember
[28:36] two things the first one is it takes a
[28:38] lot of time and the second one is that
[28:40] an audience won't follow you for no
[28:42] reason you need to build cool stuff next
[28:44] we have Reddit the cost is zero we have
[28:47] a minimum effort required and the return
[28:50] investment is medium because uh you
[28:52] never know what's going to happen um
[28:55] this for instance is a post on a r went
[28:58] viral and in one day I got like 50,000
[29:00] visitors you never really know what's
[29:02] going to happen Reddit one thing to know
[29:04] is that Reddit ate hads so they hate
[29:06] promotion so most subreddit won't allow
[29:09] you to post anything one of them that
[29:11] still allows you to post stuff like they
[29:13] literally it's made for people who want
[29:14] to share their side project so you can
[29:16] post anything here you can make a pro
[29:18] profal post um you want to reuse The
[29:21] Hacker News formula we have studied so
[29:22] you want to say like I have built XYZ
[29:25] and something happened and the outcome
[29:27] for people uh you usually it performs
[29:29] best when you have a little video to um
[29:31] introduce your product so that can be
[29:33] just you like I'm doing now with the
[29:34] camera uh explaining why you created the
[29:36] product and just showing a little demo
[29:38] of that product most other subred will
[29:40] just ban you for sharing anything
[29:42] promotionals so there are two things you
[29:44] can do the first one is there big
[29:45] subredit like the/ entrepreneurs uh
[29:48] where you can just share stories so this
[29:50] has uh this is a post of mine that went
[29:52] viral there's zero promotion I'm just
[29:54] educating people on what I've learned
[29:56] from selling my AI tool for 30 $25,000
[29:59] and if people are interested they can
[30:00] visit my profile and on my profile uh it
[30:03] says that I build apps and they're like
[30:04] a link to all of my websites another uh
[30:07] another hack on on Reddit don't tell
[30:10] them I told you that but so what I would
[30:12] do when I make free tours so these other
[30:14] marketing channels I mentioned I would
[30:16] launch them in those subredit but of
[30:18] course if it's a promotion like you know
[30:20] like there's an ad on the right and I'll
[30:22] get banned so what I do is I create a
[30:24] little URL where as a developer uh if I
[30:27] know if I add this on my site I just
[30:29] hide the promotion so now it looks like
[30:32] just a tool like a literally a free tool
[30:33] with zero promotion that could be shared
[30:36] easily on Reddit later on you can either
[30:38] remove the promotion you will get banned
[30:40] but you'll get some people seeing your
[30:41] site but you can also just uh do it as
[30:44] it is right now and add a little link to
[30:46] your social media profile and that way
[30:48] you can grow an audience on Twitter
[30:50] Youtube whatever Reddit could just be a
[30:52] platform for people to discover your
[30:54] free tools your work and you channel
[30:56] that attention to your uh branded
[30:58] personal account all right we have
[31:00] directories directories is like a
[31:01] basically like a website that is made
[31:03] for people who launch products because
[31:05] there are lots of tech enthusiasts who
[31:06] are curious about what's going on in
[31:08] Tech so this is a really good place to
[31:09] launch your product the cost is either
[31:12] zero sometimes it's free sometimes it's
[31:13] a paid I'll show you some directories
[31:15] later you can post on the effort on your
[31:17] side is really minimum because you just
[31:18] have to make a listing and the return on
[31:20] investment is really good for instance
[31:22] the probably the most popular platform
[31:24] out there is product hunt so for 24
[31:26] hours you have all those products
[31:27] competing and the one with the most upos
[31:30] stay at the top and of course gets the
[31:32] most traffic but traffic is not the only
[31:34] benefit you usually get a backlink you
[31:37] can also be shared inside of the
[31:39] newsletter of the the actual directory
[31:41] so product hunt newsletter for instance
[31:44] um you would expect if you're number one
[31:45] maybe like a 2,000 visitors in 24 hours
[31:48] if you're resar in their newsletter you
[31:50] would expect another 2,000 clicks later
[31:53] on when they share the newslet so this
[31:54] could bring significant traffic and also
[31:57] you would get a little badge uh so for
[31:59] instance this is one of my websites I
[32:00] got this little badge here for people
[32:02] who know product hun these ads social
[32:04] proof I know quite a bit of product hun
[32:05] I have launched like over 20 websites on
[32:08] there and I was awarded product of the
[32:10] Year 2023 so I will share with you some
[32:12] tips um first I also wanted to mention
[32:14] some other Alternatives uh we have un
[32:16] need which is similar to producton but
[32:18] is maintained by a solo developer and we
[32:21] also have tiny launch which is uh also
[32:23] maintained by a solo developer so those
[32:25] are free directories for you to just
[32:27] promote your startup uh if you want to
[32:29] invest a little bit of money and you
[32:30] make uh stuff related to AI there is a
[32:32] future pedia which also has a bunch of
[32:34] users and of course there is an AI for
[32:37] that which I think is the biggest AI
[32:38] directory those two will cost a little
[32:40] bit of money but they're great
[32:41] directories that will bring a bunch of
[32:42] traffic okay so now you have 24 hours to
[32:44] compete and you have to get as many up
[32:46] vote as possible so there are two types
[32:48] two ways of getting votes the first one
[32:50] is inbone of votes so up votes that you
[32:52] get from people actually on the platform
[32:54] for that you have to make a good listing
[32:56] a good listing is of course a good
[32:58] product but that's uh that's normal but
[33:00] you also need to have a good logo so
[33:02] make something that is super easy I see
[33:04] people like spending hundreds of dollars
[33:06] for a professional logo you don't need
[33:07] that make a logo that symbolize very
[33:10] simply what your product does for
[33:11] instance buy dispute is one of my
[33:13] project it's a shield with a dollar
[33:15] inside it protects your money you want
[33:17] also a name a name that is extremely uh
[33:20] outcome oriented and easy to understand
[33:22] unless you are stripe which you have a
[33:23] name that does not make any sense but
[33:25] you have VC money and you're going to
[33:27] concure the payment world uh you are
[33:29] like me a solo developer you don't want
[33:31] to make something smart you want to make
[33:32] something simple buy dispute remove
[33:35] dispute and then your headline it's
[33:37] basically 60 characters that will be
[33:39] shown on the homepage of the directory
[33:41] to explain what your product does in one
[33:43] sentence lots of people get it wrong
[33:45] especially developers you don't want to
[33:46] make it about your product you want to
[33:47] make it about the people so that can be
[33:49] either something that trigger my
[33:50] curiosity it can be a sentence that
[33:52] inspires me an emotion you want to
[33:54] remove your product from the equation
[33:56] and second you want to bring out bone up
[33:58] votes so if you're just getting started
[34:00] you might not have an audience yet but
[34:03] uh if you have I don't know 500 friends
[34:05] on Instagram you can use that that's
[34:07] already a really good start I used to
[34:09] ask my family all the time to upvote my
[34:11] launch and you want to use the badge so
[34:13] this is just a screenshot of one of my
[34:14] set when I launched it on product hunt
[34:16] you want to add somewhere on your banner
[34:18] header footer wherever this you want a
[34:20] little icon that says we are live on
[34:22] product hunt or on any directory at the
[34:24] moment would love your support and add a
[34:27] link back back to that directory listing
[34:29] so that actual visitors of your site can
[34:31] also support you during this launch
[34:33] another really underestimated marketing
[34:36] channel is YouTube live so literally
[34:38] making a live of you coding on YouTube
[34:41] this cost Zer this cost except that you
[34:43] need a camera it requires no effort on
[34:45] your side because you're just basically
[34:47] coding and the return on investment is
[34:48] great it can promote anything especially
[34:51] if you're targeting developers or any
[34:53] like a b2c apps like a habit record food
[34:55] loging Etc so this is my YouTube channel
[34:58] back a year ago I had zero followers and
[35:00] you can see that YouTube pushed some of
[35:02] my videos to people like 50,000 views on
[35:05] a 3 hours long video I have no idea what
[35:07] I'm doing there but but YouTube decided
[35:09] to push this video because there's a
[35:10] demand out there so first this will be
[35:12] good for your productivity it sounds
[35:14] simple but actually when you say that
[35:16] you're going to show up at 11:00 a.m.
[35:17] and you start the stream there is no way
[35:19] you spend time on Instagram because
[35:20] people are actually watching so really
[35:22] is going to scar at your productivity
[35:24] second you're going to grow an audience
[35:25] YouTube is going to push your content
[35:27] out there so people are going to
[35:28] discover your channel and you're going
[35:29] to build a little audience then you're
[35:31] going to get customers because there
[35:33] there there's something really important
[35:34] to understand one visitor from a random
[35:37] hiker news websites and a person who
[35:39] sees you coding live those are two
[35:42] separate person one does not care about
[35:44] you the other one trust you already
[35:46] because they can see you through the
[35:47] life and so even though you won't have
[35:49] big massive numbers just the fact that
[35:51] they're seeing you through the live
[35:53] which make them much more likely to
[35:54] trust you so you could literally be
[35:56] making money on the live live stream
[35:58] while your product is not even finished
[36:00] and finally you will discover some stuff
[36:01] some really random stuff like some
[36:03] people will jump in and try to uh help
[36:05] you with a bug uh the other day I had a
[36:08] French person who helped me with the
[36:09] design and we ended up reframing the
[36:11] entire app something will happen and
[36:13] this like all the noise that's created
[36:15] usually it's a good thing for
[36:16] entrepreneurship a few tips here um you
[36:18] want to either frame it as a challenge
[36:20] so day one of growing a software to $1
[36:22] million day two of blah blah blah you
[36:24] want to challenge yourself and you also
[36:25] want to make a good thumbnail so in my
[36:27] case I was doing something like SAS
[36:29] related so this is for developers that's
[36:31] why the background is like lines of code
[36:33] uh there are also some uh Tech icons
[36:35] like nextjs stripe Etc so it's like
[36:38] Crystal Clear it's about coding and you
[36:40] are just bring in a weird emotion it is
[36:42] hard to get started with YouTube live
[36:44] stream but this is something that can
[36:45] really change your life and now bonus
[36:47] steep try all of those El marketing
[36:49] channels it will become so good at
[36:51] marketing you will never have to worry
[36:52] on how to get traffic again now getting
[36:55] visitors in one thing but converting
[36:56] these visitors into customers is another
[36:59] and I see lots of people getting started
[37:00] who make those five mistakes so to watch
[37:03] this video if you want to convert more
[37:04] customers and if you're inspired and you
[37:06] just want to uh create stuff on the
[37:08] internet I made this three hours long
[37:10] video where I teach you everything you
[37:11] need to know to go from zero to building
[37:13] an entire business using code and until
[37:16] the next one I hope you keep shipping
