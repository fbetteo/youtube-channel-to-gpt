[00:01] I have a little trick When I visit a
[00:02] website I go straight to the pricing
[00:04] section and within seconds I know
[00:06] exactly what the product does and if
[00:08] it's worth my time because pricing is
[00:11] marketing and it can make or break your
[00:14] startup when I studied the journey I was
[00:16] not really sure how to price my product
[00:18] so I followed traditional business
[00:19] advices but none of them really worked
[00:21] and I was stuck at $0 for month I build
[00:24] 24 tiny businesses and try all sorts of
[00:26] unconventional pricing methods and
[00:28] that's how I ended up making a million
[00:30] as a solo developer so in this video I'm
[00:32] going to share the five pricing mistakes
[00:35] I made that kept my startups from
[00:37] growing and we're going to start with
[00:38] the spiciest one subscription yep your
[00:41] software probably don't need a
[00:42] subscription model now everybody is
[00:44] saying that we should Char subscription
[00:46] because that's how we make passive
[00:47] income that's how we earn money when we
[00:49] sleep but they forget one thing people
[00:52] hate subscriptions as a customer when I
[00:54] see $9 per month I know it's not just $9
[00:58] it's $108 per year and it piles up with
[01:00] my Netflix Spotify and Wi-Fi
[01:03] subscriptions and sometimes I just want
[01:05] to try the product so I have to set up a
[01:07] reminder to cancel the subscription to
[01:08] make sure I'm not charged for a service
[01:10] I don't use subscription raise
[01:12] objections in your customers mind and
[01:14] Confused customers don't buy so it
[01:16] lowers your conversion rate I would
[01:18] argue that it is as hard as selling a
[01:20] $10 a month subscription than it is to
[01:23] sell a $100 one time payment product
[01:26] let's take a quick example okay let's
[01:27] say we have two products one is a sub
[01:29] subcription product that cost $10 a
[01:31] month and that has a 10% turn rate so
[01:34] every month 10% of the customers will
[01:36] turn which means they will cancel the
[01:38] subscriptions and let's say we have a
[01:39] onetime payment product that cost $100
[01:42] up front and of course no recurring cost
[01:45] after now let's say that instantly we
[01:47] get 100 customers for both of those
[01:49] products after one month you make
[01:51] $11,000 with a subscription product and
[01:53] you will make $10,000 with the one time
[01:55] payment product and um Until the End
[01:58] you'll make zero extra r Vue now for the
[02:00] subscription product on the second month
[02:02] you'll made 900 bucks because you had
[02:04] the 10% turn rate and you'll have
[02:06] another 10% of these 900 bucks so $810
[02:09] on month three and by the end of the
[02:11] year you would make $7
[02:13] 7,176 and if you wants to make
[02:16] $10,000 as for the onetime payment
[02:18] product you would have have to wait for
[02:20] 4 years until you get the same amount of
[02:23] money so do you want $10,000 right now
[02:26] or $10,000 spread across the next 4
[02:28] years your probably doesn't need
[02:31] recurring payments a lifetime deal
[02:33] access is a great competitive advantage
[02:35] against all the big software guns like
[02:38] cenly or typ form now it raises the
[02:40] concern of yes but what if people
[02:42] overuse my product and I end up losing
[02:44] money there are two cases first there
[02:47] are the negligible costs cost where it's
[02:49] so cheap that you would have your users
[02:51] to use the product for like 300 days
[02:53] every single day in order to lose money
[02:56] I'm talking about bandwidth I'm talking
[02:57] about emails well actually let me show
[02:59] you a little little example okay so this
[03:02] is the web traffic on all of the
[03:03] products I built and uh that is about
[03:06] 200,000 page views in the last 2 weeks
[03:09] so that's roughly half a million page
[03:11] views a month now if I go to versal for
[03:14] the same billing cycle this is about 266
[03:18] GB of data transfer that's roughly the
[03:21] bandwidth now if we look at versal
[03:23] pricing I am on the Pro Plan so normally
[03:25] I get one tab included but for this
[03:28] example let's pretend that I'll pay 15
[03:30] cents per gigabyte transferred so we're
[03:32] going to do 15 cents times 266 gabt and
[03:36] we're going to do times 2.5 so we round
[03:38] this to like a month of data that means
[03:41] I would spend 100 bucks a month with
[03:44] Verso one of the most expensive hosting
[03:46] platform out there in order to serve
[03:48] half of a million page views this is
[03:51] definitely negligible let's take another
[03:53] example let's go to my emails I'm
[03:55] sending email for all my mes for people
[03:57] to sign up for reminders and I'm even
[04:00] selling email in some of my products I
[04:02] send around um 150 to 200 emails per day
[04:06] and this is the bill I got from mail gun
[04:10] last month actually
[04:12] 4,800 emails send per month this cost $5
[04:17] this is absolutely negligible cost and
[04:20] unless my customers would use the
[04:22] product for 300 days every single day I
[04:25] would never lose money on those costs
[04:28] and then there are the more expensive
[04:30] costs so that could be ads for marketing
[04:32] or that could be GPU open AI or database
[04:34] cost for your software in that case you
[04:36] can offer a credit base system for
[04:39] instance you can have an image
[04:40] generation platform where people can
[04:42] create photos of themselves using Ai and
[04:45] you could charge $10 for like 100 photos
[04:47] that way you get rid of the subscription
[04:50] headache from the customer's mind and
[04:51] you're sure that your customer never
[04:53] overuse your product if no one pays for
[04:56] your one-time payment product no one
[04:58] will pay for a subscription but if no
[05:01] one pays for your subscription product
[05:03] maybe some people will pay for one-time
[05:05] payment version of your product so shoot
[05:08] large at first and then refine later you
[05:10] can always add subscription down the
[05:12] road when your product starts to get
[05:14] traction now I'm not saying that
[05:15] subscriptions are useless and should be
[05:17] ignored one of my good friend Dan say
[05:20] that recurring value equal recurring
[05:22] payments usually subscriptions are great
[05:24] for B2B product but remember they come
[05:27] at a cost and it's worth exploring a
[05:29] one- time payment or a credit
[05:31] alternative mistake number two not
[05:33] anchoring your price when you buy a
[05:36] coffee based on where you are in the
[05:37] world or where you buy the coffee you
[05:39] would expect to spend somewhere between
[05:41] $1 to $5 but now when you're buying a
[05:44] software to generate blog articles with
[05:46] AI it's kind of hard to know what it's
[05:48] worth so as a business owner where you
[05:50] have only one pricing plan on your
[05:52] landing page you make your customer
[05:55] thoughtful because they have nothing to
[05:56] compare with that's when the price and
[05:59] core comes comes in a price enor is a
[06:01] marketing strategy that consists in
[06:03] creating an initial price so that
[06:05] customers can compare with the actual
[06:07] price you had in mind and it will make
[06:09] this price more reasonable by comparison
[06:11] let me show you a quick example of how I
[06:13] do price anchoring for all of my
[06:14] products okay first let's start with an
[06:16] example of Zenvo it's a little tool I
[06:18] build for people to avoid paying the
[06:20] stripe invoicing fee of 4% and so in the
[06:24] pricing section I have this price which
[06:26] is the one I wanted to go for $69 um I'm
[06:29] not sure why I wanted to press it that
[06:31] way but that's what I had in mind when I
[06:32] got started then I needed a price for
[06:34] people to compare with an Anor price and
[06:36] so I created this price here which give
[06:39] you access to very similar feature
[06:40] except that with the more expensive plan
[06:43] you get the unlimited strap accounts
[06:45] feature and you only get one strip
[06:47] account with this plan so this one in
[06:49] comparison looks cheaper and more
[06:51] reasonable let's take another example of
[06:53] Indie page it's a little Linkin bio tool
[06:56] for people to Showcase their projects
[06:58] their portfolio and um I wanted to go
[07:01] with lifetime deals I never wanted to
[07:02] charge any subscription here so this is
[07:04] the price I had in mind from the
[07:06] beginning you pay $45 and you have
[07:08] access the product for a lifetime now
[07:10] again what's the worth of this what is
[07:12] the worth of a linoln bio tool that's
[07:14] why I added this like one year pass plan
[07:16] it has the exact same features but the
[07:18] difference is that after one year the
[07:20] pass is removed and you don't have
[07:22] access to the product which makes the
[07:23] lifetime deal planned reasonable and
[07:26] cheaper in
[07:28] comparison so so try to always have a
[07:30] price anchor to help your customers
[07:33] understand what your product is worth
[07:34] and you can even decline your price in
[07:36] three categories good better and best it
[07:38] usually works pretty well but just avoid
[07:40] having more than three prices because
[07:43] then it becomes a burden in your
[07:44] customers mind now let's talk about
[07:46] mistakes
[07:47] number
[07:50] three this is one of my first startup
[07:54] 150,000 visitors and $6,000 in Revenue
[07:58] unless you're watching this video in
[08:00] 20150 you remember how Facebook started
[08:03] a free app that's free users loved and
[08:05] spread the word so that everybody knows
[08:07] about it and it's going viral and
[08:08] they're starting monetization years down
[08:10] the road with ads grow first monetize
[08:13] later that's a good story but as a
[08:15] soloer the journey is a little different
[08:17] I value Freedom over unicorns I won't
[08:20] raise money so I won't raise a team of
[08:22] marketers and growth hackers I operate
[08:25] with fewer resources so I have to make
[08:27] some tradeoffs and removing fre plans is
[08:30] one of them let me show you the math
[08:32] behind that okay let's start with the
[08:34] goal first and let's say we want to make
[08:36] $33,000 per month and we have a product
[08:40] with a free plan and a Premium plan at
[08:42] $5 per month now as a general rule of
[08:46] Thum 3% of people upgrade from free to
[08:49] plan this is a standard in the software
[08:52] industry that means if you want to make
[08:53] $3,000 you will need 600 premium users
[08:57] which means you would need 20,000 users
[08:59] to sign up for your product because of
[09:01] the 3% conversion rate and to get 20,000
[09:05] signups on a product we can safely
[09:07] assume you have a 15% conversion rate so
[09:09] 15% of people will create an account and
[09:11] start a free um plan which means you
[09:15] would need
[09:17] 133,000 visitors to get $33,000 a month
[09:22] I don't know how about you but that
[09:23] sounds insane removing free plan is
[09:25] removing pain as a developer I used to
[09:28] struggle to ask for money but here is
[09:31] what happened after I removed free plans
[09:33] from all of my products first I get
[09:35] better users users who are skin in the
[09:37] game they provided their credit card so
[09:39] they're giving me real feedback and I
[09:41] build better products second I got more
[09:44] motivation there's something magical
[09:45] about making money on the internet it's
[09:47] exciting and it helped me focus on the
[09:49] work and third I saved money most of the
[09:52] user base were made of free users so
[09:55] it's only costing something after
[09:56] removing the free user base there is no
[09:59] cost associated with that so consider
[10:01] ditching your free plans and add a pay
[10:04] wall of thres and that way you'll become
[10:06] profitable faster mistake Number Four
[10:09] free trials the problem with free trials
[10:11] is that people don't commit they can use
[10:14] your entire product for free for a
[10:15] couple days and that results in a huge
[10:18] drop in conversion rate after a couple
[10:20] days live got busy they went on a
[10:21] holiday and they don't come back because
[10:23] they didn't commit in first place now
[10:26] you might be wondering yeah but I want
[10:28] people to be able to try the product to
[10:29] know if it's worth it there are three
[10:31] ways to fix that the first one is to
[10:33] look upfront on your landing page
[10:36] usually if your landing page copy is not
[10:38] triggering an emotional reaction and
[10:39] there is not a clear demo of your
[10:41] software that means you going over a
[10:43] little camera and explaining demoing how
[10:45] the software Works customers don't know
[10:47] what they're buying so you can make a
[10:49] better landing page explain clearly what
[10:51] your product does demo all the features
[10:54] and that could remove the need for a
[10:55] free trial second you can offer free
[10:58] credits you let people use your software
[11:00] for a limited number of actions and not
[11:02] a duration for instance you could offer
[11:04] them to generate three images at no cost
[11:07] with your AI software generation tool or
[11:09] they can send 10 emails at no cost but
[11:12] make sure it's tied to an action
[11:14] something that they could perform so
[11:15] that after using your software for a
[11:17] couple of minutes they will face a pay
[11:19] wall and they know exactly what they're
[11:20] paying for you want them to commit when
[11:22] they are right now here on your landing
[11:24] page not days down the road and
[11:26] alternative number three you can still
[11:28] try free trials but reduce the length
[11:31] from 30 days to 7 days and ask for a
[11:33] credit card upfront an email is not a
[11:36] commitment a credit card is and final
[11:39] mistake pricing to chip I see lots of
[11:42] developers getting started who price
[11:44] like $10 to use their product cheap is
[11:47] expensive in the long run the value is
[11:50] what your product is worth its
[11:51] usefulness what's how much time people
[11:53] save with it and perceived value is how
[11:57] much a customer thinks your product is
[11:59] worth and it's influenced by factors
[12:02] like design and especially pricing when
[12:05] you price too cheap you signal that your
[12:07] product does not have value so as a rule
[12:10] of thumb always try to price a little
[12:12] higher than you think it's worth if you
[12:14] charge onetime payments avoid anything
[12:17] below $19 if you're charging
[12:19] subscriptions avoid anything below $5
[12:21] per month and I noticed a side effect of
[12:24] pricing a little higher is that
[12:26] customers will value the product more
[12:28] and they will get most out of it think
[12:30] about Udi where you can buy this course
[12:32] for like $10 to learn the entire
[12:33] JavaScript world or you can have this
[12:36] like premium $200 course made by a
[12:38] creator that you love this is the course
[12:41] you want to go for because spending $200
[12:44] on this course will make you value the
[12:47] course more and you will likely get more
[12:49] out of it and if you don't know how to
[12:51] price at all probably someone has
[12:53] already figure it out for you so look at
[12:55] your competitors and try to price in a
[12:57] similar range now this uh these mistakes
[13:00] I made um it's tailored for me and for
[13:03] the tiny 24 businesses I built it's also
[13:05] what I've seen from lots of solo
[13:07] developers building in public on Twitter
[13:09] but it's flexible that means you can
[13:11] come up with your own rules and I hope
[13:12] you prove me wrong and uh before we
[13:15] close this video I want to just mention
[13:16] that I am not affiliated with any of the
[13:18] products that you saw in this video I
[13:20] don't take any sponsorship on this
[13:22] channel and in fact I could not care
[13:24] less about the text tag I use as long as
[13:27] it's helping me move fast and until the
[13:29] next video I hope you just ship it
