[00:00] so this is how I made $5,000 us with a
[00:02] free tool I built in 3
[00:04] [Music]
[00:07] days I am launching a course
[00:10] called cancel du to volcano what
[00:12] happened is absolutely crazy this is the
[00:14] marketing cure sell it before you make
[00:17] it and I did not discount any of my
[00:21] [Music]
[00:22] product
[00:24] $55,000 what it it's free free app yeah
[00:28] it's 100% free it leaves completely
[00:30] separate to my other apps it's
[00:32] Standalone app I see sometimes people on
[00:34] Twitter sharing like oh if you want to
[00:36] make a logo try this by Mark because
[00:37] it's free people who reshare it so it
[00:39] brings constant traffic and then there's
[00:41] a little ad on the right side because if
[00:43] you need a logo maybe you need to a code
[00:45] base to ship your startup faster and so
[00:47] that brings I track exactly how much
[00:48] traffic it brings to ship fast and then
[00:50] when they pay I know exactly how many
[00:52] people bot ship fast because they
[00:54] discovered logo FAS oh so even though
[00:57] you don't have audience and you hate
[00:59] marketing so you just build a free tool
[01:02] that you like to make and then share it
[01:05] with people then make money this is
[01:08] especially for developers like me who
[01:09] are a little bit too addicted at making
[01:12] stuff this is the marketing cure cuz you
[01:15] never actually do marketing you build a
[01:16] tool you ship it because it's free
[01:19] people share about it and you have to
[01:20] make a great tool as well and then you
[01:22] get free traffic that's the best way to
[01:24] start getting traffic also grow an
[01:27] audience I usually plug my name under it
[01:29] so so people discover the me through the
[01:31] tool so you grow traffic you grow an
[01:33] audience and you get customers from it
[01:35] and it's like I think it needs to I need
[01:37] to make an entire video about
[01:41] that hello bear for
[01:44] millionaire St T yeah well why are you
[01:48] here we're here because I need to get
[01:51] this cut this way too long for now and
[01:54] tomorrow we are going to Korea and we're
[01:56] going to go to one of your best friend's
[01:57] wedding with te style are
[02:00] I don't know up you look good like a
[02:05] French
[02:07] rooster you've been calling it the local
[02:10] barbershop for a long time no I think it
[02:12] is yeah since they I mean actually when
[02:15] we mooved from Korea because we were
[02:17] like we had zero you earn 1K a month I
[02:21] think in Korea even less yeah and then
[02:23] we moved to Bali and it was 2018 life
[02:26] was way cheaper mhm and remember we we
[02:29] had like maybe 1K per month and we live
[02:31] like kings we had a swimming pool we had
[02:34] a like a nice bedroom in a Shir Villa
[02:37] it's crazy how you can reduce burn rates
[02:40] like increase your life by just moving
[02:42] to a different country I think maybe the
[02:44] numbers have changed a bit but I think
[02:46] with $1,000 a month you can leave great
[02:48] in B this is $3 like the haircut but
[02:51] after earning L of money why do still
[02:54] come to local Garber shop I don't know
[02:56] man I just like it feels natural here I
[02:58] don't feel like I
[03:00] people are genuine not pretending just
[03:02] so kind after tomorrow when I'm gone
[03:05] he's going to have more customers he's
[03:06] going to behave exactly the same he's
[03:08] not trained for me he's just he's just
[03:09] doing a thing mhm I like that authentic
[03:12] experience a lot let's see how your
[03:15] haircut would become like a local people
[03:18] man I choose number number
[03:20] eight French crop number eight yes
[03:23] makeover wow look at you
[03:30] so it is uh 7 7:50 p.m. which is 1 hour
[03:35] before my bedtime and I'm entering the
[03:37] most important part of my day I spent an
[03:40] entire hour to wind down and have bit of
[03:42] sleep because when I started the journey
[03:45] 6 years ago I remember I used to
[03:47] sacrifice hours of sleep so I could get
[03:48] work done more and I would often get
[03:51] tired and emotional during the daytime
[03:54] and 3 years ago I read a book that
[03:55] changed my life called why we sleep by
[03:57] Matthew Matthew Walker and that reframed
[04:00] how I thought about sleep I stopped
[04:02] thinking that more hours of sleep means
[04:04] less hour during the daytime but I see
[04:07] it as an investment for a better day and
[04:10] since I prioritize my sleep like never
[04:12] before you almost become like a religion
[04:15] I have the best happiest days of my life
[04:18] whether it's my body physically or
[04:19] whether it's in my head mentally even
[04:21] when nothing is happening I was grinding
[04:23] I had zero followers I made Zer I just
[04:26] felt good all the time I I try to get
[04:30] almost 100% every day and most of it is
[04:34] because of this wind down routine I read
[04:37] for 15 to 30 minutes then I do a few
[04:39] breathing exercise it's a method called
[04:42] 468 I think where you inhale with your
[04:45] nose for four times then hold for six
[04:48] times and then exhale with the mouse for
[04:50] eight times when I met Brian Johnson one
[04:52] of my hero in Singapore a few months ago
[04:55] he told me that he also struggle he
[04:57] recommended me to do this kind of
[04:58] exercise and this is working so well now
[05:01] I I really sleep so easily and to finish
[05:04] I just sit in the sofa and a few things
[05:06] I also do that really improve um
[05:08] especially if you have a deviated septum
[05:11] here and you snore at night I wear those
[05:13] patch on my nose which opens uh the
[05:15] nazle nostrils and help me breathe
[05:18] better with the nose otherwise I just
[05:19] cannot breathe and this change my life
[05:21] like crazy I used to get about an hour
[05:23] of deep sleep now thanks to this I also
[05:26] sleep on the side and I get two hours of
[05:28] deep sleep every night this is really a
[05:31] game changer so if you snore really
[05:33] consider buying one of those oh and and
[05:35] one thing that is also very important
[05:37] it's about those red light here that
[05:41] makes really chill relaxing mood uh
[05:43] there's no blue light there is no screen
[05:45] for the entire hour and then the light
[05:47] will keep dimming dimming diming until
[05:49] it reaches my bedtime at something
[05:51] around 8:45 p.m.
[05:55] [Music]
[06:23] okay so this is how I made $5,000 with a
[06:26] free tool I built in 3 days and how you
[06:28] can come up with your own free tool and
[06:30] Market your startup for $0 so this is
[06:33] the free tool in question it's a very
[06:35] simple tool where you can create logos
[06:38] uh based on icons you pick here and um
[06:41] and make whatever logo you like and it's
[06:44] promoting on the right side a little
[06:45] startup of mine called ship fast I track
[06:48] how many people click on this link it
[06:50] sends them to this website right here
[06:52] and if they end up making a purchase I
[06:54] know it in my database so this business
[06:56] here is already converging well and it's
[06:57] just a matter of sending more traffic
[06:59] that's how I came up with this idea of
[07:02] building a little logo maker because the
[07:03] reason is if someone needs a logo then
[07:06] they might need to build a website after
[07:08] and this is exactly what my startup does
[07:10] it help them build websites faster now
[07:12] there are many many other ways to come
[07:14] up with free tools ideas one of the
[07:17] popular SEO tool out there SEO hre which
[07:21] is an SEO uh software you can do a bunch
[07:23] of stuff from keyword planning domain
[07:25] Authority Etc they have four five free
[07:28] tools just like this one where you can
[07:30] have a little uh glimpse of what you can
[07:33] get if you purchase this software this
[07:35] one is a very specific where you can
[07:37] find keywords uh search like how many
[07:39] people search for those keywords for a
[07:40] specific keyword it give you a few
[07:42] information and of course if you want to
[07:44] get more of that you can get started and
[07:47] purchase their paid plan so they took
[07:49] one feature of their main software and
[07:51] made it available for free and a little
[07:53] bit limited on the internet and they did
[07:55] that for many other tools and that's how
[07:56] they bring lots of customers another way
[07:58] I do this with one of my habit tracker
[08:00] called habits Garden here people can uh
[08:02] use this app to track the Habit how do I
[08:04] get more customer for habit tracker well
[08:07] I build this thing called visualize
[08:09] habit it's an app that is again free
[08:12] that helps people realize and visualize
[08:14] what they're going to achieve in an
[08:16] entire year if they build tiny habits so
[08:19] for instance they can start their habit
[08:20] greed by saying they want to stretch 5
[08:22] minutes every uh three times a week and
[08:25] they want to work on their side Hol for
[08:27] uh 16 minutes every
[08:30] day and because sleep is important we
[08:32] also want to say that we want to get
[08:33] eight hours of sleep per night now when
[08:35] they go next then they can see their
[08:37] little grade uh what they going to be uh
[08:40] what they're going to complete in an
[08:41] entire year this gives people a sense of
[08:43] like what are you going to achieve they
[08:45] can share that with their friends if
[08:47] they want they can download that photo
[08:48] and then when they click next they can
[08:51] surprisingly sign up for my habit
[08:53] tracker and when they'll click here
[08:54] they'll end up on the Habit tracker it
[08:56] goes directly through to my website and
[08:58] it Imports all the habits that they
[09:00] created previously you can literally
[09:02] come up with any idea for a free tool to
[09:05] promote your app you want to make sure
[09:07] it takes a few boxes the first one is
[09:09] you want to make sure this free tool is
[09:11] well free it's very important because
[09:13] this is how you go viral this is where
[09:15] we're going to talk about it later this
[09:16] is where you can post your free tool in
[09:18] every uh Community every platform social
[09:20] medias out there and this is how people
[09:22] can spread the world you also want to
[09:24] make sure it has only one feature you
[09:26] don't want to make it complicated you
[09:27] want to make that feature available as
[09:29] soon as people land on the landing page
[09:31] you don't want people to click on
[09:32] buttons you don't want people to you
[09:34] want you don't want to redirect them on
[09:35] pages you don't want to collect emails
[09:37] you don't want any of that you want them
[09:38] to go straight to the point you also
[09:40] want to find an explicit name something
[09:43] that is very easy to remember logo fast
[09:46] is well a tool to make a logo fast and
[09:49] it's very important because now with
[09:51] social media people will share that if
[09:53] it's useful and this is a easy way for
[09:55] people to remember your brand search it
[09:57] on Google and this is how you improve
[09:59] your ranking there and finally this is
[10:01] kind of what I said earlier but you
[10:03] really want to make sure people don't
[10:05] have to sign up because this is going to
[10:06] kill the convers rate build it in a few
[10:08] days and once you're ready there are
[10:10] tons of places you can launch your tool
[10:12] I will link to an article below where um
[10:14] it's a list of all the places you can
[10:16] launch for free so we have R product
[10:18] Hacker News um directory AI directories
[10:21] like there is an AI for that in future
[10:22] pedia for each of them there is a
[10:24] tutorial to help you uh increase the
[10:26] chances that it goes viral use those
[10:28] platforms to LA launch your free to
[10:30] basically you want to drive as much
[10:31] traffic as possible on the launch day so
[10:33] it makes like a little buzz or boom you
[10:35] want people to talk about it on social
[10:37] media Tik Tok Instagram Etc and hope
[10:39] that the tool will keep spreading here's
[10:41] a quick summary of what you get when you
[10:42] start building free tools first you
[10:44] appeal to wider Market just like logo
[10:47] fast there are people who might not be
[10:48] interested in ship fast but they might
[10:50] be interested in a logo second you start
[10:52] to rank for new SEO keyword it could be
[10:54] your brand name but it could also be
[10:56] some keyword that people search on the
[10:58] internet since it's a free tool then you
[11:00] have chances to go viral because this is
[11:02] you know like something is free it's
[11:03] valuable you can easily share it to a
[11:05] friend it also helps you grow an
[11:07] audience because it keeps you
[11:09] accountable every week you build a new
[11:10] free tool you share it on Twitter
[11:12] Youtube Instagram wherever this is your
[11:13] hanging out this will signal to people
[11:16] that you're someone who shows up because
[11:18] every week you have a tiny new tool to
[11:19] share it also make a good first
[11:22] impression if you think about href which
[11:24] is a software that is pretty expensive
[11:26] when they have this free tool it's it's
[11:28] easy to use is friendly I'm like this
[11:30] seems like a good company and we all
[11:32] know that first impression matters a lot
[11:34] and finally if you're a developer like
[11:36] me and you're addicted to spending too
[11:37] much time coding this is one of the best
[11:39] way to be self-driven because you
[11:41] actually never really spend time doing
[11:43] marketing you're basically building
[11:44] tools that will be used as a marketing
[11:49] tool oh man this is our last dinner in
[11:51] belly I'm so sad a true we're leaving
[11:54] tonight yeah I'll miss this yeah yeah I
[11:58] mean this is so healthy I feel so good
[11:59] after eating that true like recently you
[12:02] made domestic change on diet as well you
[12:05] quit sugar and both of us actually so
[12:07] how did putting all this sugar and
[12:10] eating healthy diet impacted you it
[12:13] feels good it feels really good because
[12:15] I remember I used to eat lots of pastas
[12:18] and I would be tired after and I would
[12:20] just sit on the couch and do nothing
[12:22] with this I've almost feel like I can do
[12:24] a workout after that and I'm not hungry
[12:27] it has a I don't know it just feels like
[12:28] it's the like a kind of a power food
[12:30] somehow what is your secret of healthy
[12:34] food I have a lovely wife cook so
[12:37] well actually I think avoiding carbs in
[12:40] general is a good practice or you get
[12:42] get it from like stuff like sweet
[12:44] potatoes you mean avoiding the processed
[12:47] carb but eat lots of like a complex carb
[12:51] yeah with a fiber like vegetable fruits
[12:55] nice entrepreneur not only work is
[12:57] important good sleep
[12:59] good food to fuel your brain is very
[13:02] important okay some some I know I've
[13:04] seen some tweets like because I tweet
[13:05] often about sleep exercise and and diet
[13:09] and I read in the comments some people
[13:11] who mentioned that I only say that
[13:13] because I made
[13:15] it but I think what they don't see and I
[13:18] wish you know I I I wish we recorded
[13:20] YouTube videos earlier is we have been
[13:22] doing this especially like sleep and and
[13:26] and exercise from Day Zero M and this is
[13:29] how I was able to grind for like 2 years
[13:31] with nothing happening that's true even
[13:33] though you don't have much money you can
[13:35] still prti sleep food and work out cuz
[13:40] we still work out through free YouTube
[13:43] video yeah we don't have a gym
[13:45] membership yeah we still eat like we
[13:47] don't go out so actually cooking at home
[13:50] is much cheaper much cheaper yeah even
[13:54] for that I think the fact that you're
[13:56] here it helps a lot oh that's true yeah
[13:58] I wouldn't be able to cook that and work
[14:00] and then also cancel cancel du to
[14:03] volcano everything is canceled to the
[14:05] volcano what happened is absolutely
[14:07] crazy there's a volcano eruption this
[14:09] morning and 90% of the flights are
[14:11] cancelled except today every every
[14:15] flight was cancell but luckily our
[14:17] flight didn't get cancelled because it's
[14:19] at 1:00 a.m. the day after so why every
[14:24] time we fly out there's something like
[14:27] accident always happen we're literally
[14:29] the only flight leaving tonight for
[14:31] Korea easy there is absolutely no one
[14:34] this is
[14:36] immigration I have never seen the
[14:38] airport so empty I can't believe we were
[14:45] boring good morning good morning did you
[14:48] well so
[14:51] [Music]
[14:57] well we made it through hurry up
[15:00] wondering how my shoes will like it
[15:03] [Music]
[15:11] [Music]
[15:35] [Music]
[15:36] wow we're
[15:43] in workout completed by 5° I think the
[15:47] cold
[15:49] killer no excuse always work okay so I
[15:54] just landed in Korea and it's going to
[15:55] be a crazy week we're like couple days
[15:58] before the Black Friday and I have been
[16:00] working on a new product for the past N9
[16:03] month it's it is the biggest project
[16:06] I've ever released I have so much work
[16:08] to be done if the product is available
[16:10] for Black Friday you will know it at the
[16:12] end of this video and at same times I
[16:14] also want to mention about last year's
[16:16] Black Friday where I run kind of an
[16:19] unusual type of deal where I would did
[16:22] not discount the product and I was able
[16:24] to generate 10K Revenue in like 36 hours
[16:28] I want to I want to show you a little
[16:29] bit how I managed to do that so you can
[16:31] replicate but first I need to find a
[16:33] coffee shop and since we're in Korea it
[16:36] shouldn't be
[16:45] hard it
[16:50] up uh big bummer I realize I forgot my
[16:53] uh wire cable so I cannot record videos
[16:57] on my laptop with this camera so I'll do
[17:00] the Black Friday update at home okay I
[17:02] just got back home and I want to share
[17:04] about what I've learned last year from
[17:05] making $111,000 for the Black Friday
[17:07] deal the first one is that you want to
[17:10] stand out this is my way of standing out
[17:12] I make those weird videos where I go
[17:14] live with uh someone famous like uh
[17:17] Jimmy felon uh this is my way of doing
[17:21] things it's not everybody's ways and of
[17:23] course the fact that I have an audience
[17:24] makes everything a little easier but
[17:26] this tweet is a promotional tweet it
[17:29] would never get 500 likes if I hadn't
[17:32] make videos that gives people a reason
[17:34] to stay a little bit on that page during
[17:36] Black Friday there will be tons of other
[17:38] business owners that will try to make
[17:40] their product stand out so try to find
[17:42] something creative something that feels
[17:43] like you to stand out and give people a
[17:46] reason to have a look at your discount
[17:48] so this is the Black Friday page I built
[17:50] for my product and I did not discount
[17:53] any of my product when it comes to
[17:55] making discounts there are two schools
[17:57] of thoughts the first one her people who
[17:59] say like you should make Black Friday
[18:01] discount this is how you make lots of
[18:02] money Etc and there's another school
[18:04] that says do not discount your product
[18:06] because it train your customers to
[18:08] expect discounts so even though you'll
[18:10] have a spike during Black Friday you
[18:12] will Flatline after that and you will be
[18:14] waiting until the next discount I don't
[18:16] know which one is right I believe it's
[18:17] somewhere in the middle I believe Black
[18:20] Friday is a good excuse for people to
[18:22] finally buy a product they've been
[18:23] waiting for but I also believe that you
[18:25] don't want to make your product look
[18:27] cheap and for that reason instead of
[18:29] discounting your product you can create
[18:31] a bundle so what I did back then ship
[18:33] fast one of my uh one of my main product
[18:35] was $149 instead I bundled it with other
[18:39] products I added this Indie page product
[18:41] and this buy dispute product and I made
[18:44] the three of them for the same price as
[18:46] shifas and so the discount is only on
[18:49] the bundle and not a single product and
[18:51] so instead of lowering the value of one
[18:54] product I increase the value inside of
[18:56] the same price if you don't have another
[18:58] product to sell maybe you have a little
[19:00] course or little PDF you can create
[19:02] something of extra value that you can
[19:04] release for The Black Friday and bundle
[19:06] it together with your main products okay
[19:08] I have a few days left before the Black
[19:10] Friday so now it's time to rock and
[19:15] roll you look so fashion yeah yeah me oh
[19:21] I'm
[19:28] oh how much better say we are going to
[19:33] my best friend's wedding and yeah we're
[19:36] going to show you how the typical Korean
[19:38] couple get married here which is very
[19:40] different from our wedding yeah I think
[19:43] Korean people are more efficient we do
[19:45] one hour wedding one hour buffet and
[19:47] then bye-bye and we're going to give
[19:50] them blessing to have a nice honeymoon
[19:52] in New Zealand because they're a big fan
[19:54] of camping are they going there yeah
[19:55] they're going New Zealand oh nice it's
[19:57] interesting this the first time we wear
[19:59] proper clothes in like 6 months H
[20:01] actually like a power by my dad he gave
[20:04] all the clothes for Mark like a shirt
[20:07] pants and a watch I do not watch I do
[20:10] not own any of those clothes it's all
[20:13] all all of her dad's clothes
[20:17] [Music]
[20:36] [Music]
[20:36] [Applause]
[20:42] it is ready it's been 9 month I am
[20:46] preparing for this single day I am
[20:49] launching a course called coat fast pick
[20:52] backstory here when I started sharing
[20:54] whatever I do on the internet people
[20:56] started to asking me questions and the
[20:57] number one question question people ask
[20:59] is how did you learn how to code I Tau
[21:02] myself how to code back in 2016 and it
[21:04] was really hard I had to spend hours
[21:06] debugging stuff without finding the
[21:08] answer and then sometimes I I would get
[21:10] stuck for weeks honestly it was really
[21:12] not fun but in 2022 since chpt announced
[21:15] the release of their AI models I have
[21:18] been using AI all the time in my code
[21:20] editor and I realized that it's getting
[21:22] much and much easier whenever I don't
[21:23] know anything I just ask chpt and these
[21:26] days I barely don't even code anymore I
[21:27] just write English and review the code
[21:29] that the AI made and at the same time I
[21:32] am not doing anything complicated I'm
[21:34] not like a advanced software engineer
[21:35] for a big company I do simple things
[21:37] like building landing page user
[21:39] dashboards and all these kind of things
[21:41] which is like 10% of what you need to
[21:43] know if you're like a proper software
[21:44] engineer so it is way easier than it
[21:47] used to be because of AI and if you want
[21:49] to build a tiny business you don't need
[21:50] to know everything so I decided to make
[21:53] this course I'm trying to tell the
[21:54] little story of how I learn how to code
[21:56] and how chpt the the arriving of AI
[21:59] changed everything and also the fact
[22:01] that it's pretty new even if it's 2022
[22:03] it's only been like since 2024 that AI
[22:07] is literally like super efficient inside
[22:08] of your code editor and most of the
[22:11] courses out there are still teaching
[22:12] people how to get a job and uh I think
[22:15] there is a new opportunity for people
[22:16] who just want to learn how to make your
[22:18] ideas into reality and eventually code a
[22:20] light little business so this is the
[22:22] website that you're seeing right here um
[22:24] huge inspiration from gumroad and
[22:26] another site called links as well um you
[22:28] can see uh I have been overthinking the
[22:31] those little uh buttons here and there
[22:34] this is the actual course so there three
[22:36] parts in the course one is about the
[22:38] mindset not just coding but the mindset
[22:40] of you know how to train yourself to use
[22:42] AI for everything um how to ship ideas
[22:45] like the mini smaller version of your
[22:46] app so you don't spend month building a
[22:48] product um a few tips also about
[22:50] marketing and how to make money with
[22:52] your products then there's another part
[22:54] about the fundamentals so a don't like
[22:56] an hour about an hour long version of um
[22:59] HTML CSS and JavaScript how the internet
[23:01] works just the basics so that people
[23:03] following the course know exactly how to
[23:05] how the internet works and how to ask an
[23:07] AI to do things for them and then
[23:09] there's a big big part uh right now it
[23:11] Sayes 7 hours but I think it's going to
[23:12] be a little more than that where uh
[23:14] we're building an entire software from
[23:16] scratch from the landing page designing
[23:18] a little bit of marketing as well and
[23:20] then everything that involved in assess
[23:22] so private user dashboard uh
[23:24] subscription payment with stripe Lon
[23:26] squeezy sending emails authentic users
[23:29] Etc as well as using AI heavily in order
[23:31] to code really fast I really put my soul
[23:34] out there uh there's a little confession
[23:36] that I've made probably on the internet
[23:38] I hated school I hated how things were
[23:40] taught to me and I really try to teach
[23:42] this course in a way that is simple easy
[23:45] fun with a real outcome a goal that you
[23:48] might want to build your freedom you
[23:49] might want to turn your idea into
[23:51] reality I'm really trying to make this
[23:53] course as engaging as fun as possible so
[23:56] it never feels like you're learning but
[23:58] it feels like you're having fun so maybe
[24:00] I can show you a little demo of what's
[24:01] inside of the course so there are three
[24:03] parts the part you just saw earlier
[24:05] mindsets the fundamentals and your each
[24:08] lessons are breaken down into sections
[24:11] or categories whatever and then each
[24:13] lesson is like a 30 seconds to sometimes
[24:16] one or two minutes long I I really try
[24:18] to break them down into the smallest
[24:19] part possible and because I am a
[24:21] developer after all I need to
[24:22] procrastinate a little bit so I played
[24:24] around and there's like a dark theme a
[24:26] way for people to focus and just be
[24:28] fully locked in into inside of a lesson
[24:30] um well this is me procrastinating here
[24:32] that brings me up to today and why I'm
[24:34] releasing this course now it is about
[24:36] 80% completed I think I need a couple
[24:39] other weeks to finish it fully so I
[24:41] think it was an opportunity for me to
[24:42] launch this course at a cheaper price to
[24:45] reflect the fact that uh there's still
[24:47] some lessons that I need to work on and
[24:49] it's also an opportunity for anyone
[24:50] learning how to code to grab the
[24:51] discounts now that it's cheaper and so
[24:53] you will find under this video a link to
[24:55] the course to see if it's a fit for you
[24:57] and that's how you can grab the Black
[24:59] Friday deal I hope you like it and that
[25:01] you keep shipping 6 years ago I fired
[25:04] the developer in my head in order to
[25:06] become an entrepreneur but I couldn't
[25:07] have done it tone it's because of my
[25:11] friend
[25:13] Andre all right so we are in s South
[25:16] Korea and we met for the first time 6
[25:19] years ago in a similar area and I was
[25:23] back then I was like 100% thinking about
[25:26] whatever product I'm going to build this
[25:27] is what my matters and you came and you
[25:29] told me something I will always remember
[25:31] sell it before you make it yeah what is
[25:33] the first thing you you what is the
[25:35] actional thing you tell me do that you
[25:37] remember yeah so the actionable thing
[25:40] that I told you at that time was that
[25:42] you should uh pick a niche first of all
[25:45] like an it a niche that is very
[25:46] interesting to you that you feel excited
[25:48] to work with and then go you know scrape
[25:51] some emails from people of that Niche so
[25:54] like maybe you know 10 a day or whatever
[25:56] you feel comfortable sending emails per
[25:58] day and um and then just try to get them
[26:01] to raise their hand and say that they're
[26:03] interested in some type of value
[26:04] proposition that you're offering and
[26:06] then once they raise their hand you try
[26:07] to get them on a call and then you make
[26:09] you make an offer you make a pitch and
[26:11] then from that it's mathematically
[26:14] impossible not to get your first client
[26:16] and start to make money and start to
[26:17] build confidence and then have a service
[26:20] or a product that you're proud of so
[26:21] it's 2018 so people the world does know
[26:24] does not know what Zoom is and I'm
[26:27] following his device I'm sending emails
[26:29] to businesses that I've never seen
[26:31] whatsoever and then I told them to to
[26:33] jump on a zoom call and a few of like
[26:35] most of them like what what is zoom you
[26:37] know like I have no idea what like they
[26:39] don't even reply but a few of them say
[26:40] yes and eventually that's how I end up
[26:42] making my first $1 on the internet and
[26:45] this is crazy it's all everything
[26:47] everything is like everything started
[26:48] with with Andre it's crazy and you can
[26:50] do it too nothing stopping you earlier
[26:52] we were talking about the product first
[26:55] mindset that I had that you helped me
[26:57] like break and go from the
[26:58] entrepreneurship mindset what would you
[27:00] say is the things that developers lack
[27:03] when it comes to entrepreneurship yeah
[27:04] so the product first mindset it it it
[27:07] makes a lot of sense but another way to
[27:09] think about it is um a customer first
[27:11] mindset so the way I think about a
[27:13] customer uh first mindset is you go
[27:15] directly to the customer first right
[27:17] instead of trying to build something and
[27:19] then and try to sell it one to many
[27:21] which is very very difficult you go
[27:23] directly to whatever target market
[27:25] you've identified you talk to one person
[27:27] in that Target Market you identify what
[27:28] their problems are and then you build
[27:30] something specifically for them and now
[27:31] you're in a position to gather those
[27:34] insights get that market data and then
[27:36] build a SAS later or continue down the
[27:38] the service based mindset too that works
[27:40] as well if your goal is to make money as
[27:42] soon as possible which I know a lot of
[27:44] people's goal is just to get some to
[27:46] generate some cash flow then there's no
[27:47] faster way than going directly to
[27:49] somebody and asking them what their
[27:51] problems are solving proposing proposing
[27:54] to solve that problem and then getting
[27:55] money to fix it right that's the fastest
[27:57] way and and then from there you have
[27:59] options you can build a SAS or you can
[28:01] continue down that server space path
[28:03] it's like a hypothesis it exists in your
[28:04] head yeah but like it yeah you're
[28:06] putting a lot of time energy into
[28:08] something that you don't even know
[28:09] somebody will buy so the fastest way to
[28:11] know if if somebody will buy is to go
[28:13] directly to the market ask them yourself
[28:16] and all you lose is a little bit of time
[28:18] yeah making those Cod emails exactly
[28:20] right so that that to me is probably the
[28:23] safest most effective route than trying
[28:26] to build something uh that that you hope
[28:28] people will buy later because those
[28:30] insights are incredibly valuable that
[28:32] you gain from working with someone
[28:33] one-on-one that's how you got fired me
[28:35] up 6 years ago to choose between
[28:38] subscription or onetime
[28:40] payment oh you do onetime payment if
[28:43] like you want to build something and not
[28:45] really like think about it too much yeah
[28:47] right but I think one time payments are
[28:48] good for validating something if if no
[28:50] one buys your One Time payments no one
[28:52] will buy your subscription if no one
[28:54] buys your subscription maybe they'll buy
[28:56] your Ser your service for onetime
[28:57] payments so from a development
[28:59] standpoint I think it's really up to
[29:01] your own priority right like the nice
[29:03] thing about subscription is that you you
[29:04] have this money coming from the same
[29:05] people over and over they become loyal
[29:07] to you and it forces you to continue to
[29:10] build on that one app and develop it so
[29:12] if it's like your one baby and you want
[29:14] to you know take off with it and you
[29:15] want it to be like your one Legacy
[29:17] product then a subscription might make
[29:19] sense because again it just keeps you
[29:21] accountable to continue to force
[29:22] yourself to develop it and improve it
[29:24] Etc but if you just want to ship a bunch
[29:26] of stuff I think a one time payment is
[29:29] probably idea it's a good point I didn't
[29:30] say it this way it's like like almost
[29:31] forcing you to be productive by having
[29:33] subscription that's true it's like a
[29:35] financial accountability you have to the
[29:37] user right it's like they're paying you
[29:38] every month so they expect to see uh
[29:41] more products more updates more a lot of
[29:43] different maybe a community component
[29:45] maybe all these different things but uh
[29:48] that depends on your own priority as of
[29:55] development this is my uh current family
[29:57] knows apartment and this place is
[29:59] magical to me because this is when ship
[30:01] pass idea came from this idea eventually
[30:03] turned on into a million doll business
[30:06] so uh trouble
[30:08] [Music]
[30:11] more now I need to turn off these camera
[30:14] before I get deported from Korea for
[30:16] installing equipment on the balcony this
[30:19] is the setup this would be no issue in
[30:22] belly your friends but here you never
[30:24] know
