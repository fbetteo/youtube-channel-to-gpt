[00:30] all right I guess we
[00:34] are Bingo okay hi everyone uh good
[00:38] morning good evening good afternoon
[00:39] whatever you're calling from um Mark
[00:42] here and we are day three of building
[00:46] startups a small startup like a small
[00:49] software in uh you in in public on uh
[00:53] YouTube Twitter and I think twitch as
[00:55] well so uh it's the day three the
[00:58] product is almost done
[01:00] today we're going to focus on the
[01:02] pricing and the user authentification
[01:03] and tomorrow we should move on to the
[01:07] landing page and I hope to be done by
[01:10] Friday for a launch next Monday um if
[01:13] you have no clue who I
[01:15] am I am Mark L um I live here in Bali
[01:20] and I have uh really tiny internet
[01:23] businesses uh all these here that you
[01:25] can see um are making about $555,000 a
[01:29] month I have no intention to become a
[01:31] unicorn funer to raise uh VC money or to
[01:34] hire any employees I just have fun
[01:37] building little website uh for myself
[01:39] while enjoying the beautiful life here
[01:41] in B I've been building in public um
[01:44] Twitter for about two years now sharing
[01:47] everything that I do and learn and I'm
[01:50] trying to get this to YouTube or twitch
[01:53] or whatever like with live videos so
[01:55] it's a bit more friendly and and it's
[01:58] just live
[02:00] uh before we jump on into coding and the
[02:03] product um recommend you if you're from
[02:06] Twitter to go and use the YouTube link
[02:09] I'll be
[02:10] sharing uh because the quality will be
[02:13] just so much
[02:18] better and we going to tag Elon Musk
[02:21] because it's been couple days the
[02:23] quality is really bad on Twitter so if
[02:25] you want a higher quality check out the
[02:27] link that is just below
[02:30] um and we're just going to update the
[02:33] thumbnail on YouTube making sure it's
[02:37] friendly and we should be good to
[02:39] go I'm also trying if uh if there's
[02:42] anyone coming from twitch here I'm
[02:44] trying to stream on Twitch I don't know
[02:46] if this is
[02:47] working I'm trying to stream on Twitch I
[02:49] don't know if this is
[02:51] working my
[02:54] bad is yeah I'm not very familiar with
[02:57] stre I'm not a streamer so they suck a
[03:00] little bit at all that it looks like
[03:02] there's something yeah this is
[03:03] definitely me so it looks like it's
[03:05] working on Twitch so if you want to
[03:07] check it out there um it's live as
[03:13] [Music]
[03:15] well is it oh yep I have to say it's not
[03:18] made for
[03:21] kids works but it's slow in tweets okay
[03:24] yeah yeah Twitter is very uh not good
[03:26] for the quality so come on a YouTube I'm
[03:30] a streamer yep I am a streamer now I
[03:34] guess um okay I think we can move
[03:41] on all right so we have um okay where we
[03:47] so today we are just make sure yep okay
[03:51] yes everything is working okay today we
[03:53] are building uh Zenvo I already B the
[03:55] domain name it's called zen. there's
[03:58] nothing deployed yet
[04:00] it's a very simple tool it's a no code
[04:03] tool for stripe users it lets uh people
[04:06] who are using stripe in invoice let
[04:09] their customers retrieve edit and
[04:11] download their invoices simply there was
[04:14] a quick
[04:15] example we go back here uh those are my
[04:20] websites and uh for instance for Indie
[04:22] page uh it's making about $1,000 a month
[04:26] the one of the most common requests I
[04:28] get is can I get an invoice and can I
[04:31] edit that invoice can I add my business
[04:33] ID my business vat details on it and
[04:36] this is not really fun uh part as a
[04:39] business owner and I would rather have a
[04:41] tool that would let me that will let
[04:43] everything um done for me so I'm
[04:45] building zenice as a business owner I
[04:48] will get a link a unique link that is
[04:51] connected with all my stripe accounts I
[04:53] can use that link and send it to my
[04:55] customers and my customers can input
[04:57] their email to retrieve their invoice uh
[05:00] they can edit the invoice add their VI
[05:01] details change their email address and
[05:03] all that and download the invoice so
[05:05] instead of having to do everything
[05:07] manually as a business owner my
[05:09] customers would do it themselves and I
[05:10] would just share the same link all the
[05:12] time uh so because it's day three of
[05:16] building h startup in public I've
[05:19] already done a few things already so
[05:21] this is the dashboard I will see as a
[05:23] stripe uh I mean as a customer but so as
[05:26] a stripe accounts owner um we get a
[05:30] link I'll show you how that works um we
[05:33] connect stripe accounts using
[05:35] restructured API Keys which are API Keys
[05:37] which gives limited access to some
[05:39] resources on the accounts because I just
[05:42] need customers to be able to retrieve
[05:44] their invoices I don't need to handle
[05:46] anything with a webbook I don't need to
[05:47] create customers or anything I just want
[05:49] the get information so we create
[05:51] restricted API keys with
[05:53] stripe um this is here and this will
[05:56] give me access to specific uh resources
[05:59] like like I can only read customer data
[06:02] for instance this is just safer uh once
[06:05] I add the strip account it will be
[06:07] displayed here and then I will have this
[06:09] link that I can share with my customers
[06:12] and so as a customer I I will send this
[06:14] link at the top um don't know if I can
[06:16] zoom I hope you guys can see
[06:19] well yeah okay so there's this link that
[06:22] I will send to my customers they will
[06:23] get this uh page where they can input
[06:25] their email and when they type their
[06:28] email it is going going to fetch all my
[06:30] strap accounts so back here those are
[06:33] all my strap accounts that I've
[06:34] connected for now is going to search for
[06:36] each of those strap accounts um what
[06:39] have what are if there is if there are
[06:41] any customers under this uh email and
[06:44] then as a customer of my customer so as
[06:47] a this is getting tricky but anyway you
[06:49] get it like as a uh person who wants the
[06:52] invoice I can see all I've paid to the
[06:54] business here and then I can either
[06:56] download the invoice right away or I can
[06:58] edit it so here uh this is a typical
[07:01] stripe invoice and can see here I messed
[07:04] up my name so I can retype it and say
[07:06] markl and I leave in Indonesia and this
[07:09] is my email address and I can add my vat
[07:12] whatever this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 and I can
[07:15] download the
[07:18] invoice they should be here and then I
[07:20] have an updated invoice with my details
[07:24] and so that um Mark as a business owner
[07:27] doesn't have to do this manually for the
[07:28] customers to customers can do it
[07:30] themselves and they can add pretty much
[07:31] anything they
[07:33] want um for now I only make the customer
[07:37] details updatable like editable uh
[07:40] because we don't want to change any of
[07:42] those information
[07:43] here um I will see later if we get more
[07:46] feedbacks but I think that should at
[07:47] least for my use that's way
[07:50] enough um yeah that's pretty much it so
[07:55] now this is working from the customer
[07:57] side uh we also have you customers can
[07:59] log out and can see their billing
[08:01] information now we need to process the
[08:03] payment um this is going to be a onetime
[08:06] payment thing I don't know yet how much
[08:08] is this going to be but I want to try
[08:10] something that have worked well for my
[08:12] other startups
[08:14] where customers pay before logging in
[08:18] because I don't I want to have a nice
[08:20] ending page that is clear uh it's not a
[08:23] very complicated product so people don't
[08:24] need to sign up to understand how it
[08:27] works I want to make them commit so pay
[08:30] before logging in because when you log
[08:32] in users you it you add more clicks more
[08:34] steps so you can get less customers
[08:38] because you know someone would link with
[08:40] uh would connect authenticate with their
[08:41] email and the email would get lost go to
[08:43] spam or just customers would just forget
[08:45] and didn't open the email and so this is
[08:48] using a potential customer so I would
[08:50] rather have first a pay wall and then
[08:53] have the user login and so technically I
[08:56] think what is going to happen is people
[09:00] will sign up well so on the landing page
[09:03] there will be a buy button it's going to
[09:05] open a stripe checkout and if the stripe
[09:08] Che out checkout session is completed
[09:10] and successful is going to send create a
[09:13] customer in the database and send that
[09:15] customer a unique link to log in and
[09:18] then they will end up on this page here
[09:20] where they can set up their
[09:22] page that was a lot of talking sorry
[09:25] about that uh I hope this is a bit clear
[09:27] for everyone I'm going to uh
[09:29] get started in coding I have my phone
[09:31] where I can see
[09:33] messages uh where the chat is so if you
[09:37] are sending messages going to end up
[09:39] here uh so yeah from time to times I
[09:42] will have a little break from coding and
[09:43] and check uh you know if you guys have
[09:45] any questions just want to
[09:46] chat to get Brian um if I enter someone
[09:49] else emails I can see the invoice if you
[09:51] enter someone you would need to have the
[09:54] unique link from uh the business like
[09:57] the person who created this account here
[09:59] and you would have to find the email of
[10:01] their customers yet in that case you
[10:03] could potentially see how much they
[10:06] spent on the business
[10:17] yeah all right going back to it
[10:28] so
[10:32] trying to think about the logic
[10:35] of maybe we'll build a landing page and
[10:38] Stripes checkout so normally in the
[10:42] page
[10:45] word Buton check
[10:48] out so
[10:51] obviously I have a few I'm using uh the
[10:54] Boer plate I created for that so I have
[10:57] already a bunch of components that are
[10:59] are waiting for me where I can create a
[11:01] stripe
[11:02] checkout real easily for
[11:07] instance I'll have to give it a
[11:16] price yeah we give it we give it a mode
[11:18] of I think no we don't need to give it a
[11:20] mode because I think it's already one
[11:21] time
[11:25] payment
[11:27] yeah will give a price ID
[11:31] of have to create it in stripe so I'm
[11:34] going to go back in
[11:39] zenice this is only in prod mode for now
[11:42] I have nothing live the website is not
[11:44] deployed so you
[11:52] know in that and we are going to create
[11:55] a new product in stripe um I'm going to
[11:57] set a random pricing for now and I will
[12:00] change it when I go
[12:02] live I think that would be so that would
[12:04] be definitely a one-time payment thing
[12:08] um if you if you guys have any clue how
[12:12] much that should be priced I I was
[12:13] thinking somewhere ranging from 29 to 49
[12:18] onetime
[12:24] payments I'll see I'll I'll put 49 for
[12:27] now just for the
[12:30] prodiction for the development
[12:32] environment and see you
[12:35] later okay I cannot
[12:38] type invoice
[12:41] sender self served
[12:49] invoices logo One
[12:52] minut charging
[12:57] us49
[13:04] all right
[13:05] so we get that thing here we are going
[13:09] to get the price ID and we're going to
[13:11] go in the config
[13:13] file won't be using us I can remove
[13:22] [Music]
[13:27] that
[13:30] okay and here I'm going to import the
[13:31] conf
[13:36] file set
[13:39] stripe plans
[13:42] zero it will be just one plan and we're
[13:44] going to give it the price
[13:46] ID which
[13:49] means uh yeah we already have the
[13:52] payment button
[13:53] here this is going to open a checkouts
[13:55] and I don't have set I didn't have set
[13:58] the stripe AP yeah keys I will have to
[13:59] do this for
[14:10] now right going to turn off my screen
[14:13] because I'm going to
[14:15] reveal all the API Keys I've set up so
[14:19] just one
[14:21] second L public
[14:25] key secret
[14:27] key
[14:33] and um yeah just one minute I need to
[14:35] set up the webbook endpoint as well so
[14:38] it's going to be a local web hook for
[14:40] now going to run it on my local
[14:57] machine good to go or
[14:59] not inv voice yep I need to log in into
[15:03] stripe in my uh
[15:05] terminal and then I'll start
[15:09] a um the local server so it's going to
[15:12] send stripe web hook even so if I make a
[15:14] checkout on development mode is going to
[15:16] send it on my uh local environment which
[15:20] I can then listen to the events and
[15:22] create check listen like to web web
[15:25] books so I can update the user in the
[15:27] back end
[15:29] uh we are good with
[15:31] the okay time to get the screen back on
[15:36] I just set up my stripe and variables
[15:38] and have now a little uh stripe webbook
[15:42] local webbook listener and so normally I
[15:45] can create a checkout session for
[15:48] $49 s serve invoices and I can pay
[15:54] okay all right so this is the first step
[16:00] now I need to
[16:03] brainstorm so when customers pay they'll
[16:05] receive an email with a code that says
[16:09] here is your uni link I'm using next
[16:12] oath for authentification I'm going to
[16:15] find a way to generate this piece of uh
[16:17] code I think it's called verification
[16:19] token so that the user received it on
[16:21] their mailbox the and when they click
[16:24] the link they're logged
[16:27] in
[16:33] 49 bucks to not hide your
[16:35] screen and that would be
[16:38] a I think
[16:41] those yeah those environment variables
[16:43] it's are the one I reuse for all my
[16:45] other startups so yeah you would have to
[16:48] add at least three zeros to
[16:54] that El
[16:55] so
[16:57] think
[16:59] where is the name of it next
[17:02] oath oh
[17:04] wait we are going to check the webbook
[17:07] from stripe um this is some boiler plate
[17:10] code I've already uh prepared with one
[17:13] of my other products so this is already
[17:16] here for me when a strip checkout
[17:19] checkout session is completed so this is
[17:21] what we're doing here we are going to
[17:23] find the
[17:25] session um add a pricity to the customer
[17:29] uh going to retrieve the customer from
[17:33] stripe database we have more information
[17:36] about the customer like the customer
[17:37] email that they input during the
[17:39] checkout which is
[17:41] important uh we won't have this because
[17:45] the user so the user will pay without
[17:48] being logged in first so we have no clue
[17:50] who the user is and we'll have to handle
[17:52] everything with the
[17:55] email so if the user can find the user
[18:00] okay if the customer has an email we're
[18:02] going to try to find a customer from an
[18:04] email if no user we're going to create
[18:06] that customer and we're going to say
[18:08] that so the user models I think has a as
[18:11] access Boolean and we're going to say
[18:13] that user as access equal
[18:17] true and then oh yeah we actually we set
[18:19] it up later so we don't even need to
[18:21] change
[18:22] anything we create a user add the
[18:25] customer ID the price ID and
[18:27] access
[18:29] so actually
[18:31] normally uh this should be pretty simple
[18:33] so I have a local database mongodb
[18:35] running so normally if I make a payment
[18:37] here it's going to create oh maybe i'
[18:39] because I've created an account in the
[18:42] past it might not recreate the user wait
[18:45] let's
[18:47] check in the
[18:53] page but we already have yeah of course
[18:55] we already have the user so under my
[18:56] email name uh um he doesn't yeah he
[19:00] doesn't have
[19:02] access what we can do here we can try to
[19:05] make a
[19:10] payment and see what we
[19:16] get
[19:20] oops all right we get the payment going
[19:23] through the web books being received and
[19:24] we can see here as access was turned to
[19:27] true and if for some reason which will
[19:29] be the case normally there is
[19:33] no user the user is not found is going
[19:36] to create the user and then later on is
[19:39] going to update the user with as access
[19:40] so we can accept payments create a user
[19:43] in the database we just now need to send
[19:47] a link for the user to authentic
[19:49] authenticate
[19:52] themselves so I think the rir so the
[19:55] button checkout on the redirect Eur L if
[19:58] there is a success we're going to send
[20:01] them to some page that says thank you
[20:03] for your purchase um check out your
[20:08] emails yeah to L in whatever
[20:20] um I'm last with an new version of nextg
[20:23] how to get the
[20:27] current
[20:28] well
[20:30] actually I'm going to ask my
[20:33] uh send user to slash uh
[20:40] success
[20:56] okay okay
[20:59] uh if we have something like
[21:06] this okay so we send them to the success
[21:09] page so here I will have to create a
[21:11] little page called
[21:19] success and that page will
[21:27] be
[21:35] um I think we'll need to import the
[21:37] button supports just in case um
[21:41] customers for some reason it cannot uh
[21:45] there is a problem we need to show a
[21:47] support button so it's already built in
[21:49] the boiler plate as
[21:50] [Music]
[21:57] well
[22:00] we no we don't need to sign users
[22:04] in
[22:07] um so that's success page here there is
[22:09] a talk to support button which will go
[22:12] in my uh to my emails there's any need
[22:16] help with invoice
[22:19] okay we need to have um a little message
[22:26] somewhere
[22:30] thanks for your trust and we going to
[22:32] add a little
[22:35] heart and we're going to say um
[22:38] please Che out check your emails and
[22:43] spam or the login link see on the other
[22:49] side see you on the other
[22:55] site yep we can make these much
[22:59] bigger text 3 XEL font extra
[23:03] bold breing
[23:05] tight and these we can say t
[23:11] space space
[23:13] content
[23:15] [Music]
[23:18] secondary
[23:22] okay we have the sort of success page
[23:24] now we need to handle
[23:26] the r check your emils and because we
[23:30] are nice people and because I'm a French
[23:32] person and I write English terribly I
[23:35] need to double check my
[23:37] grammar
[23:39] okay support button SEC for trust
[23:44] okay so now we need
[23:49] to um let's let's actually check that
[23:51] this is
[23:55] working oh that's fun
[23:58] oh I
[23:59] think oh
[24:01] boy that is fun I think it is because
[24:06] I it is magical when you create piece of
[24:08] code six months ago you forget about it
[24:10] and then you go back to it and you're
[24:11] like oh wow that was cool like I'm happy
[24:14] I spent some time doing this the
[24:17] route why would because I think it has
[24:20] the customer
[24:22] ID how could it
[24:26] be
[24:28] mod
[24:31] price create check
[24:35] out oh because the user is logged
[24:38] in he's going to fetch the user from the
[24:41] database and he's going to
[24:43] prefill I guess price mode Clan
[24:54] reference the check
[24:56] out oh yeah okay it prefills the user oh
[24:59] it adds the user data when it creates a
[25:01] check out okay that's cool okay but
[25:04] normally that will not happen because
[25:05] user should not be logged in but for
[25:07] logged in user which is the case here
[25:08] I'm logged in under my email it knows
[25:11] I'm already I've already made a
[25:15] payments it has my C my strip customer
[25:17] ID and it automatically prefill my
[25:20] credit cards which is going to make
[25:22] testing easier now we can test the
[25:25] success
[25:26] URL
[25:30] we have the page good good
[25:32] good it's time to move on
[25:36] um and now we
[25:39] need the web
[25:41] [Music]
[25:44] Handler and here okay here this is where
[25:46] we're going to
[25:50] send send login email to the
[25:55] user and for that
[25:58] if there is anyone in the chat who is
[26:01] familiar with NEX
[26:05] oath I basically need to do
[26:10] the when you log users with magic links
[26:14] it's in two steps first user input their
[26:17] emails receive an email and then click
[26:19] the email and then they're logged in I
[26:22] already have the user email I need the
[26:24] second part where I need to basically
[26:27] creates a verification token in the back
[26:31] end and send them an email so here they
[26:34] should be two parts so first want
[26:38] create verification token I think is
[26:42] next po I will have to find this in the
[26:45] next oath library
[26:47] and
[26:51] to send
[26:54] uh login
[26:56] link
[26:59] user by
[27:01] email all right so I have to do that
[27:04] part and I think I'll have to dig
[27:06] through their Library let me check if uh
[27:08] there's someone in the chat that is much
[27:09] smarter than
[27:12] me is this life what are we building
[27:15] super
[27:26] team
[27:29] quality is not clear yeah yeah man you
[27:31] have to go on the YouTube or the twitch
[27:33] link for some reason the Twitter stream
[27:38] quality it really
[27:42] sucks hey Mr Frank nice man link your
[27:45] Indie page would love to check it
[27:55] out okay uh
[27:58] GitHub I think we're going to go on
[27:59] GitHub next
[28:03] oath so we need to create those
[28:06] verification tokens
[28:08] here expires
[28:15] 27th uh I think that would be called
[28:18] create token
[28:26] probably
[28:28] verification
[28:30] okay okay I will have
[28:34] to send token
[28:37] okay okay we need the
[28:46] adapter where did we get the adapter
[28:48] option
[28:50] okay create verification token and then
[28:54] we send the request so here provider
[28:58] we
[29:00] send okay this is exactly okay those are
[29:03] the exact two parts we're going to be
[29:07] doing we need to send to create the
[29:10] token and
[29:11] send how come they send the request
[29:16] first okay the
[29:26] create
[29:32] get access to this function somewhere in
[29:33] next
[29:40] oath send
[29:45] token I wish I wish it would be that
[29:49] easy emailing your by generating a token
[29:52] and sending it to the user's email with
[29:53] the help of a
[29:55] datab adapter and the end CH direct
[29:58] verif request
[30:06] page where do we call that
[30:15] thing
[30:16] okay here
[30:19] send request
[30:26] op
[30:36] word function sign
[30:37] [Music]
[30:56] in
[31:00] internal
[31:07] emotions here I am trying to read
[31:11] typescript um okay my
[31:26] providers
[31:47] what do we need for that so we need
[31:49] um the
[31:52] token and verification
[31:56] requests
[32:07] send the email
[32:16] here oh
[32:18] wait little
[32:26] verification
[32:35] [Music]
[32:47] build the Comm would you say it is
[32:50] easier to build the for the community
[32:52] like the B plate you
[32:55] made um
[33:02] I'm not sure if I understand your
[33:04] question
[33:07] correctly um I mean in in the case of
[33:11] fast I
[33:13] think there are probably about
[33:16] 1,600
[33:17] customers it is a nice Community but I
[33:20] think it's very hard to make at least
[33:22] for me to make tiny products for this
[33:23] community because it's very Ultra
[33:26] targeted
[33:27] and
[33:28] so I pretty much haven't pushed anything
[33:31] to the community I just they get the B
[33:34] plates and I I never retarget them with
[33:36] other product that I make I would
[33:38] because I
[33:40] think um Twitter is a better fit in a
[33:43] sense that you don't have to use ship
[33:45] fast or you don't have to be a nextjs
[33:47] user for instance uh to use what I'm
[33:49] building now that wouldn't make sense at
[33:51] least for me to build specific product
[33:53] for the shifas community and I would
[33:54] rather do it for Indie makers who are
[33:57] out on
[33:58] Twitter and have probably a different
[34:00] text
[34:03] te it's not calling it is just creating
[34:07] an Asing function call and then awaiting
[34:09] with promise oh
[34:11] okay
[34:14] um oh it's true that wrot to
[34:25] that
[35:00] the question is how do I get the
[35:02] provider and the adapter
[35:04] data
[35:07] um so here I give it here in the options
[35:10] and in the option I
[35:13] give request
[35:25] options
[35:28] request
[35:55] options
[36:01] maybe that's
[36:03] it need
[36:05] okay return provider oh
[36:27] I guess I will have to hardcode those
[36:29] things by
[36:42] hands hey yo Manish man I'm creating uh
[36:46] I think go on the TW the YouTube link
[36:48] it's easier because there's a
[36:49] description below it it's basically a
[36:51] stripe invoice uh editor and
[36:55] Generator
[37:03] we need okay maybe I'll just code
[37:05] it yeah I have to code it by hand
[37:09] um but here we just send an email so
[37:12] that should be pretty simple provider id
[37:16] that's also something I can get easily
[37:17] Bas yourl same P back yourl easy as well
[37:22] token yeah we need to get we need to
[37:24] make that token first
[37:28] and token create hash what is
[37:32] that okay that I can find easily as
[37:35] well what is a
[37:46] secret okay Royer
[37:51] Secrets okay I think this is probably
[37:53] something that I've set up already yeah
[37:55] okay I think I know what it is and then
[37:57] we need the token so we need to create a
[38:01]  GB verification
[38:05] token
[38:12] is is which is which
[38:16] is
[38:18] either notification token
[38:21] or random
[38:23] stream is
[38:25] it
[38:38] okay are
[38:55] those
[39:06] this is more than 32
[39:10] characters let's see what we get
[39:14] verification
[39:25] token
[39:33] what is the
[39:36] pro oh okay so that's something why why
[39:39] would that be on the provider
[39:43] area
[39:55] per
[40:07] no maybe it doesn't matter we just need
[40:09] to create a verification token and we
[40:11] move
[40:25] on
[40:34] right guess I give it a
[40:39] try I'll do
[40:46] this wait
[40:48] TP V
[40:55] insert
[41:01] okay I'm going to do something a bit
[41:02] dirty just for
[41:03] now I'm going to handle this in this
[41:06] routes so I can test every time I click
[41:08] the
[41:08] button um what if we import the
[41:25] T
[41:40] I've been using
[41:42] Mo think I've been using so much
[41:45] that I don't even know how to create a
[41:47] collection
[41:49] in just
[41:53] uh where was that
[42:03] okay verification okay we're trying to
[42:06] do this here we going to have to create
[42:09] so
[42:11] token one two three and it doesn't make
[42:15] sense no maybe we get the
[42:18] database I don't even know if this is
[42:25] right
[42:40] and insert one two and data what is
[42:55] two
[42:58] I have no clue what I'm
[43:25] doing
[44:33] C
[44:46] prise we going to go to the
[44:53] noeb get collection
[45:05] oh boy I don't have no clue how to use
[45:07]  because of D
[45:21] it I guess this
[45:24] isos to have my client somewhere
[45:54] here
[46:40] the
[47:17] no clue what I'm
[47:24] doing
[47:30] damn it
[47:54] um
[48:24] yes
[49:24] vcation
[49:26] name of it verification
[49:42] toets oh no that's a database name um
[49:45] whoops I have no clue oh Zeno
[49:54] okay
[50:13] TV
[50:24] collection
[50:41] nope and here we
[50:44] go no clue if this is going to
[50:51] work Bingo this is
[50:54] working oh
[51:03] boy I create the token and then I need
[51:07] to send it
[51:08] back
[51:23] to does it do so
[51:31] [Music]
[51:46] generation verification
[51:51] token this is what we need to do next
[52:00] so identifier token
[52:11] okay maybe I can check how this is
[52:14] created
[52:24] um
[52:27] adap
[52:34] adors where are you oh adapter okay adap
[52:44] M how do you make that
[52:54] token
[52:57] verification token is the name of the
[52:58] database
[53:01] okay get
[53:02] [Music]
[53:05] session create verification
[53:08] token oh you're not the one who creates
[53:11] the token
[53:12] okay
[53:17] so provider generates the
[53:21] token that's
[53:24] interesting provider
[53:30] uh where's my wait adapter is the
[53:33] database and the provider is supposed to
[53:35] be the login thing
[53:39] okay
[53:54] um
[54:08] damn it
[54:16] where I'm trying to understand in next
[54:21] oath when you log in with emails like
[54:24] magic links
[54:26] where is the token generated the
[54:31] provider should generate a token this
[54:33] thing
[54:36] here or a random string of 32
[54:40] characters or maybe it's just a random
[54:42] string of 32 characters
[54:45] in If this is what it
[54:48] is is it really 32
[54:54] characters
[55:01] [Music]
[55:06] uh
[55:11] e2x let's see if we get this
[55:16] um create some helper functions
[55:19] here going to go for that
[55:22] uh
[55:24] Le
[55:40] helpers thank you type
[55:51] script
[55:54] okay what we get here so we going to
[55:56] import that import
[55:58] random
[56:00] string and we're going to say that the
[56:02] token is the random 3
[56:05] 32 how does that look
[56:11] like oh looks like a token okay so we
[56:15] get okay we get the
[56:17] token right I'm going to leave with that
[56:20] this is
[56:23] working so we get the token
[56:27] create verification
[56:31] token going have to Hash that
[56:45] token okay we just insert that in the
[56:49] database
[56:51] so identify so we're going to have um
[56:55] constant uh token uh
[56:59] verification token which is going to be
[57:04] identifier we're going to say
[57:09] email this doesn't matter much for now
[57:13] then we will need the token and we also
[57:15] need the type which I guess is no type
[57:20] okay is it yeah no oh expires
[57:23] okay
[57:26] oh we need to create a
[57:32] hatch await create hash token and secret
[57:35] okay this is those are two information I
[57:36] do not have for
[57:41] now where are we going to create the
[57:48] HH still that little
[57:53] thing come with
[57:57] me put you in those helpers and you
[58:00] going to be
[58:03] here okay random stream and create
[58:08] hash I get to create hash and now I need
[58:10] to get the
[58:14] secret uh where do we get the secret
[58:16] what is that secret thing provider so
[58:19] provider so mongod DB secret or options
[58:22] to secret uh next
[58:26] oath is there something and there we go
[58:29] process
[58:31] oath this should
[58:34] work and finally expires which which
[58:39] which which which where are you
[58:48] expires wrer that Max
[58:52] age one day in seconds okay really
[58:58] simple one day in second so there will
[59:01] be six one day in seconds yeah 24
[59:05] hours
[59:07] time 60 Minutes time 60
[59:11] seconds and then here
[59:16] okay which
[59:18] means
[59:20] uh if
[59:23] I
[59:25] so
[59:35] insert and let's see what we
[59:46] get do we have something new in the
[59:48] database
[59:51] Bingo yes maybe
[59:53] okay
[59:55] all right this is good expires tomorrow
[59:58] that is good and we have the email okay
[60:00] so we can create the token I
[60:03] think only thing now we need to do is to
[60:06] send that token to the user's
[60:10] email
[60:12] so
[60:13] [Music]
[60:21] email so we have the email here
[60:35] going to need that
[60:37] URL the
[60:41] token verification requests what is
[60:43] happening here so we create a transfer
[60:45] we send the
[60:47] email and that's it oh
[60:50] okay yeah probably that wouldn't matter
[60:52] at this point because we should get the
[60:53] real email from the customers
[60:56] so um to identifier your from we're
[61:01] going to have to fix this sign in to
[61:04] host next H URL and
[61:09] hosts host host
[61:13] host
[61:15] okay basically we need we just need to
[61:17] create this
[61:23] URL
[61:28] uh B
[61:29] URL
[61:42] this I'm going to say something
[61:53] like

[64:50] next next o
[64:51] [Music]
[64:53] yourl
[64:58] Yep this is something I should have
[64:59] deployed one second I need to check my
[65:01] environment
[65:10] variables next oath
[65:13] URL oh yeah okay I get this
[65:23] here
[65:38] okay I get
[65:52] it you
[65:55] varable if your next application use a
[65:58] custom base path spe custom base path
[66:01] [Music]
[66:05] specif
[66:12] uhuh all right I'll have to do some
[66:14] debugging probably
[66:18] later so that would be something like
[66:20] this api.
[66:22] o API oath call
[66:25] back email here because we're going to
[66:27] be sending via
[66:31] email new search BMS and so here we have
[66:36] Local Host so the Callback URL which
[66:38] probably we're going to get from the
[66:41] config
[66:48] file uh we want to do this dasboard yeah
[66:52] this is where we're going to be s s
[66:54] back Local Host
[67:00] admin where does it says
[67:10] admin
[67:16] nowhere back
[67:18] [Music]
[67:20] here getting tired man token we have it
[67:24] [Music]
[67:27] email email we have it and we just need
[67:30] this so here this is going to be
[67:42] uh almost almost
[67:49] almost I think here it's going to
[67:52] be
[67:57] back here
[68:06] l. oath P back your
[68:12] L and these should
[68:14] be
[68:22] next this interal girl
[68:41] uml it hardcut it we're going to
[68:45] say um process
[68:50] do M do
[69:02] devopment
[69:04] and
[69:08] or
[69:13] HTTP local
[69:16] hosts
[69:17] [Music]
[69:20] 3,000 or this is going to be
[69:26] https config do domain
[69:35] name okay and then the C
[69:39] okay think we can give this a
[69:43] try see if we get a url console.log
[69:47] [Music]
[69:52] url later will try sending real email
[69:55] emails with this if you're around the
[69:57] chat stay with me uh I'm trying to set
[70:00] up a system where people can pay before
[70:03] logging in because sometimes you lose
[70:06] users by have having forcing them to
[70:09] sign up before um or receiving emails
[70:13] that might never arrive in their mailbox
[70:15] or they just you know forget to check
[70:16] their emails and they just move on but
[70:18] to change that I'm trying to have most
[70:20] of my startups having the pay wall
[70:23] before the bling part that also help me
[70:25] avoid having a bunch of users who just
[70:28] sign up and never end up paying which um
[70:31] just clutter my database and increase my
[70:33] email cost so pay wall and then payments
[70:37] oh pay wall and then
[70:41] email get the verification token and we
[70:44] get the
[70:52] URL let's see if that
[70:55] works one more
[71:01] time reading call back URL oh yeah I
[71:05] made a error typo here waiting for the
[71:09] typ script types script fixes
[71:12] this actually types script would have
[71:14] fixed this we don't care about that
[71:16] because this is not going to go that
[71:19] far one more
[71:21] time okay we
[71:24] have okay this is traded and normally
[71:28] if I did not mess up the code this
[71:32] little link here when I'm going to pass
[71:34] it here it should send me to it should
[71:38] log me
[71:40] in
[71:43] Hallelujah Bingo all right this is
[71:46] working
[71:47] um let me check I'm going to have a
[71:49] little launch Break um what are you
[71:52] building Mark I am building something um
[71:54] a little stripe invoice generator and
[71:56] editor um if you want more information
[71:59] you can check the description on the
[72:00] YouTube
[72:02] link maker what St do you use what stack
[72:05] do you use and what coding languages
[72:08] framework did you learn in order which
[72:10] tools would you recommend learning today
[72:12] um I use I currently use
[72:15] nextjs with uh stripe for the payments
[72:18] with mail gun for
[72:22] email what else twin for The Styling
[72:25] with da UI library on top of it and
[72:28] mongodb as a database um and this is
[72:32] definitely what I would recomend I mean
[72:33] I think it doesn't really matter as long
[72:35] as you build something but this is
[72:37] working well for me is what I'm used to
[72:39] and I try to I don't try I actually
[72:41] never change the stack that I'm using
[72:45] every time I come back at it it's easier
[72:47] and also um I have made my little boiler
[72:50] plates of the code that I know and it's
[72:53] much faster this way and I learned
[72:56] coding um the really wrong way I start
[72:59] to learn Frameworks like ionic first on
[73:01] react native without knowing how to do
[73:03] JavaScript it was a terrible mistake uh
[73:06] and that cost me probably two years lost
[73:08] doing bunch of Copy Co code copy pasts
[73:12] and nothing actually really worked uh
[73:15] yeah start with JavaScript uh start with
[73:17] HTML and CSS and then stack some stuff
[73:20] on top of it like react and nextjs and
[73:23] ship some apps once you're ready uh cuz
[73:26] you don't you don't need to have a
[73:28] complex
[73:31] text hi from India hello man hi from
[73:34] Bali we're not so far away the chicken
[73:36] man that's a fun
[73:40] name ear ahead of his
[73:43] time yeah make Ling yeah it's a I mean I
[73:47] I love the product I didn't really want
[73:49] to sell it it's just I had no idea how
[73:51] to grow that um
[73:54] real
[73:55] quick I sold I made this thing
[73:59] here uh probably now it's probably like
[74:03] 108 month ago
[74:05] something uh you input some text and you
[74:07] generate a little lending
[74:09] page yeah I'm not logged in oh maybe I
[74:11] still have my
[74:15] accounts I sold it so I don't know if I
[74:17] can still use it oh yep I can I still
[74:19] have my account
[74:22] okay
[74:26] it's a little bit slow okay yeah so this
[74:29] is it it's basically a leting page
[74:30] builder with AI so now the page is
[74:33] already built but basically you would
[74:35] create a new page and you would type
[74:37] whatever you want choose the language
[74:39] you want and when you get started you
[74:41] will make the page and it will create
[74:43] something like this for instance once
[74:45] you're here it's a very simple software
[74:49] U not software a landing page editor so
[74:51] you can type uh a new text
[74:54] you can um change pictures if you want
[74:56] you can upload your own picture generate
[74:57] some pictures with AI um ask St photos
[75:02] like query the basically the Nash API
[75:05] and replace those
[75:06] photos did the new
[75:10] owner it maybe they up the Nash APA
[75:13] okay it looks like they it up
[75:14] anyway um yeah you have a bunch of
[75:17] themes so you can change your landing
[75:18] page as you
[75:20] want and you have a little preview here
[75:23] there's a typo here as well then once
[75:26] you're ready I think there should be a
[75:28] link oh you can add oh nice they changed
[75:30] that pretty cool you can add your own
[75:32] domain to
[75:34] it and
[75:36] then normally you should have a page
[75:39] yeah there we go and you should have
[75:40] like a little lending page here that you
[75:42] can show to customers um I made that
[75:44] last
[75:45] year and of course you don't see my
[75:48] screen yes you don't see my screen okay
[75:50] that's I keep making that mistakes over
[75:52] and over
[75:53] Dam
[75:55] it um I was I was replying to Adam I
[76:01] think um yeah I just made
[76:04] this almost a year ago now and uh I sold
[76:07] it and I think the new owner is working
[76:12] on it because I can see there's some
[76:13] edits like you can now add your own
[76:15] domain name it's a letting page
[76:17] generator made with AI so you type some
[76:19] texts and you have this sending page and
[76:21] you can add sections
[76:24] you can add buttons you can add a bunch
[76:26] of things you can change the text change
[76:27] the
[76:29] photos and you have your little page
[76:32] here pretty much
[76:37] it what back in language to you use with
[76:40]  uh I use Mak sense getting more
[76:44] comfortable with the B plate Mak sense
[76:45] you're getting more what language you I
[76:47] use with I so I use next nextjs
[76:51] API to query the database and I
[76:55] have on top of um I don't
[76:58] know because I learned this way I don't
[77:00] know if it's relevant but it's working
[77:01] for
[77:03] me and yeah I think that's pretty much
[77:05] it
[77:08] um so I'm going to have a little lunch
[77:11] break with a wife
[77:13] wos you guys know her probably from
[77:15] Twitter I'll be back in less than an
[77:18] hour I'll leave the stream on and I'll

[119:31] when you're high than to do I don't I
[119:34] don't think I would I wouldn't be I
[119:35] would be able to code anything if I was
[119:38] um we are making a little startup very
[119:42] tiny thing a stripe nood tool for stripe
[119:45] business owners to help them manage
[119:47] invoices um so they have have a unique
[119:49] link they send it to their customers
[119:51] their customers can search their own
[119:53] invoices and edit them and download
[119:57] them
[119:59] um so let me show my screen I guess we
[120:03] are we are we are at day three right now
[120:07] we have a product that's working uh we
[120:10] have the product facing customers that's
[120:13] working too you can see here type your
[120:16] email and you can get download and
[120:18] search and whatever type your
[120:21] invoice
[120:23] um think I should have okay we'll see
[120:27] this later yep this so this is working
[120:30] uh this is the dashboard for stripe
[120:31] account owners they have the link they
[120:33] can add stripe accounts now we are
[120:34] finishing the
[120:36] pricing and I'm trying something for all
[120:38] my new startups where I make a pay wall
[120:42] before a loging page uh to avoid losing
[120:46] potential customers um right after the
[120:48] landing page they will face a pay wall
[120:50] and this is what I'm trying to do right
[120:52] now so I'm using next o so the ID is
[120:56] landing page uh click the get started
[120:59] button LS directly on a uh stripe
[121:03] whatever U yeah stripe checkout page and
[121:06] then after the checkouts they go on a
[121:07] success page like
[121:09] this
[121:13] nope yeah thank you for trust please
[121:15] check your
[121:17] email to L in and then and um they will
[121:20] go it will generate a l a unique link
[121:23] for them and they will just click to
[121:25] sign in and they will land on the
[121:27] dashboard it's pretty much what I'm
[121:28] trying to do here so we have the success
[121:31] page and we are playing around with um
[121:35] generating verification tokens in the
[121:41] database and yeah that should be good I
[121:44] need to integrate so I wrote the code
[121:46] and it worked so far to create the token
[121:50] and send it to the user
[121:53] upon checkouts so now I need to place it
[121:56] at the right uh area of the app so I
[122:00] guess copy this wait first I need to
[122:02] change the music in the living room cuz
[122:04] now we
[122:05] have this is a good it's a good music I
[122:08] think they're Russians I love
[122:11] them it's not the mood right now I think
[122:13] I need something more
[122:17] chill I don't know if anyone is a
[122:20] streamer here and have any idea how I
[122:21] could share my music
[122:24] without going into copyrights issues and
[122:26] so also the sound would be
[122:28] great um if you know please share it I
[122:32] would love to uh share a little bit of
[122:34] what I'm listening to so we can kind of
[122:35] like a mood in the Stream and I want to
[122:39] start a setup I have zero doll what can
[122:41] I do uh and know of what I'm doing costs
[122:45] dollars like maybe $1 per month for
[122:48] emails
[122:49] can send up to thousand emails which is
[122:51] way
[122:52] enough um hosting is free for the first
[122:56] app with versal and most softwares and
[122:59] everything are free
[123:00] so yeah build something build a little
[123:03] something and add a buy
[123:06] button you think without you think
[123:09] without unboarding without unboarding
[123:11] will affect version uh it depends on the
[123:14] products in my case it's very simple
[123:17] it's a it's a really tiny product
[123:19] so the landing page should do the EMB
[123:21] boing um if it doesn't then people will
[123:24] never buy
[123:26] so so
[123:28] yeah in in this case it wouldn't make
[123:31] sense to have an on
[123:33] boarding um okay it's time to go back to
[123:37] the
[123:39] code so we are going to copy
[123:45] that remove
[123:47] that
[123:49] so copy that thing
[123:54] here so this is the default route I
[123:58] don't need to touch it make sure I
[124:00] didn't mess it
[124:05] up didn't touch it perfect now we are
[124:09] going to the web hook stripe webook web
[124:11] hook
[124:12] Handler going to import my functions
[124:15] alers WB
[124:17] okay hash and config file
[124:21] okay and here when the checkout is
[124:26] completed um we create the user and we
[124:30] are going to pass the code here so this
[124:33] is not config but conf
[124:36] fight the email
[124:40] is customer
[124:42] [Music]
[124:45] email there's no user yeah we need a
[124:47] customer email so we will need
[124:49] definitely need something
[124:51] here we create a token we create a one
[124:55] day experation date we create the
[124:58] URL
[125:03] um oh can make it base path base
[125:07] [Music]
[125:10] URL and we're going to do
[125:17] this
[125:22] this is it local hosts or config fly
[125:27] domain name
[125:31] perfect and we can
[125:34] replace that by Bas
[125:38] URL we can also replace that with the
[125:42] Bas
[125:44] URL so this Ur URL here will be sent by
[125:48] by email to the customer with a
[125:53] token we also save the token in the
[125:56] database uh where is
[125:59] it
[126:01] we we insert the token in the database
[126:04] and here we need to send the email so
[126:06] we're going to
[126:08] do send email we have um so I'm using a
[126:13] baller plate code that I've made for all
[126:16] my um websites so I'm using a pieces of
[126:19] codes so this one send email is a
[126:22] function that is using the mail gun
[126:26] API there we go thank you copilot and
[126:28] we're just going to send
[126:30] uh you know the welcome email so sending
[126:33] to the
[126:35] invoice send to the
[126:37] invoice yeah I think there should
[126:40] be yeah that should do
[126:42] it I think it's time to test it so check
[126:47] out click going pull the logs cuz it
[126:51] might not work in the first
[126:53] time um this should trigger the webook
[126:57] Handler we'll see that okay we have the
[127:01] token is CR STP error checkout session
[127:04] completed we have an error here we have
[127:05] to check it
[127:07] out but we have this but normally here
[127:13] we should have three tokens maybe four
[127:15] okay
[127:17] three this one that was created right
[127:21] now we also have the link here that
[127:26] should log users in so actually if I
[127:28] check my emails I should have received a
[127:30] lot of something and I did not there's
[127:33] something wrong here probably you know
[127:37] unauthorized even
[127:39] type looks like something different
[127:42] invalid callback URL
[127:47] error
[127:50] wait wait wait what are you
[127:54] doing so I got this
[127:57] URL see if we get something read the
[128:00] page
[128:02] here we get the email the
[128:06] token The Call by
[128:09] ql this is
[128:11] working and this going to remove the
[128:14] token as well yep it removed the token
[128:16] so the link is working I did not receive
[128:19] the email oh maybe because I didn't set
[128:21] up the
[128:23] emails that could be the thing
[128:26] or it ended up in spam folder
[128:31] nope right error
[128:39] unauthorized right here
[128:46] unauthorized
[128:49] we completed the checkout session what
[128:51] is that thing oh maybe that's just
[128:54] because well what are you talking about
[128:57] we just run the code that was in
[129:01] there oh yeah
[129:06] okay try
[129:09] catch something happened here it's

[146:30] to my
[146:40] variables okay we are
[146:44] back um
[146:48] okay awesome so yeah something I always
[146:52] do for all the new website I set up I
[146:56] never buy a specific uh email account
[147:00] for the domain name
[147:02] like
[147:05] um I'm I'm not using like G Google suit
[147:08] or something to create like a specific
[147:10] account like Mark at
[147:12] zen. I always add I can send with a
[147:16] domain
[147:17] so this is what I do with maun and then
[147:20] when I receive email uh whatever at zen.
[147:24] iio is going to be forwarded to my
[147:27] personal email and so now that I have
[147:30] six online businesses um instead of
[147:33] having six email addresses I have I have
[147:36] six uh domain sending uh emails through
[147:41] domain their own domain names but when I
[147:43] receive email it all land in my personal
[147:45] mail mailbox
[147:47] which lets me uh run those U mini
[147:50] internet businesses without having to
[147:52] create a separate uh go uh whatever
[147:56] Google or uh mail account for each of
[147:59] them and so for that when I receive uh
[148:02] those there's a t little tutorial here I
[148:05] do create
[148:07] route um and I think it's going to be
[148:10] something like this or to yeah I'm going
[148:13] to copy that and create a route in mun I
[148:16] think need a catch
[148:19] hole route select match
[148:23] recipients
[148:25] minutes okay forward
[148:31] to forward catch all catch match
[148:34] recipients and we want to say

[152:29] that
[152:30] on the homage on a incognito mode so no
[152:34] cookie nothing store in the
[152:36] cache I go here I'm going to

[152:45] I should I remove that
[152:48] account you know what I'm going to use
[152:50] an old email to test it I have a very
[152:53] old account that I don't use
[152:55] anymore hmail.com that's
[153:01] frr all right there's a bunch of crap in
[153:03] there uh doesn't matter we are going to
[153:06] test with this email so Mark
[153:10] clue and then
[153:15] here
[153:20] Mark
[153:26] nope mail.
[153:29] frr
[153:32] okay so here on the backand we are
[153:36] supposed to generate a URL which is good
[153:39] please check your
[153:40] emails let me check my emails making
[153:43] sure that I received that probably in
[153:44] yeah it's probably here because I
[153:45] haven't s that many emails for
[153:50] now it's a
[153:53] legit where are
[153:56] you Mark at by dispute Mark at Zenvo
[154:00] there we go so this link here I should
[154:03] not open it because I should copy
[154:10] pastey link
[154:12] address so I want to be on the yeah I
[154:16] want to be in incognito mode to try
[154:18] without the
[154:19] cookies everything seems to be fine in
[154:22] the
[154:23] URL let's sign up and bingo okay I sign
[154:27] up and here we go normally here I have
[154:30] my customer portal
[154:34] nope let's see why is
[154:39] that we have a price
[154:43] ID it's not working why this is it
[154:47] working
[154:52] see you can't create a portal session in
[154:55] test mode until you save your C okay oh
[154:58] yeah it's because I have forget that
[155:00] should be a default set up in stripen
[155:04] this is not cool every time I get crab I
[155:09] get yeah I get surprised with that you
[155:11] have if you want to use a customer
[155:15] portal you have to go there and activate
[155:20] it you just have to click activate this
[155:23] link and then normally now if we go back
[155:26] and we do
[155:29] billing that should be a default
[155:33] value there we go we have
[155:36] um the customers created information go
[155:40] back to the invoice we have a unique
[155:43] link obviously nothing will happen
[155:45] because I didn't didn't add any stripe
[155:47] accounts but if I were to add a yeah but
[155:52] I don't have test account to try for
[156:00] numit these accounts so we just maybe
[156:03] want to add uh on the dashboard we want
[156:06] to show little error
[156:13] message these accounts
[156:17] we're going to
[156:22] do links equal
[156:24] Z if there are
[156:31] no if there are no accounts we want to
[156:34] show a message why is we going to show
[156:38] that
[156:43] [Music]
[156:44] so
[156:50] and here we're going to say
[156:52] class T SM text
[156:58] warning add a STP accounts first and we
[157:00] are going to show a little
[157:11] war customer ads STP accounts he going
[157:15] to add this page here and then the link
[157:18] here will fetch all the invoices on
[157:19] their
[157:20] Des that looks like it's
[157:29] working here we go um is it going still
[157:32] there isn't ship fast one time payment
[157:35] or ship fast is a onetime
[157:37] payment boiler plate
[157:41] yeah we have like a Discord server
[157:43] somewhere for o us we we do have um a
[157:46] community on
[157:48] Discord probably 1,000 members now and
[157:52] it's uh pretty active we share lots of
[157:56] uh things that going on when building so
[157:59] uh bugs and and things like that but
[158:01] also we connect we connect each other
[158:04] Twitter accounts we share some marketing
[158:07] tips that we find and we help each other
[158:10] when we do a little
[158:14] launch
[158:18] good um we can close that we can close
[158:20] that we can close that
[158:23] too is that good enough um oh yeah we
[158:28] want okay we want to confirm two two
[158:31] things first the we don't want people to
[158:35] for some reason if someone logs
[158:37] in they will need to have a login button
[158:40] somewhere we want to make sure if
[158:42] someone managed to log in without paying
[158:44] that's ay that person
[158:47] cannot actually get value from the
[158:49] product so we are going to send
[158:52] errors from the API
[158:55] and that there is a way to purchase once
[158:58] you're logged in so for that I
[159:02] think it's button stripe
[159:05] account so to connect the stripe account
[159:08] on the
[159:12] API here we're going to say that's if
[159:17] uh user that doesn't have
[159:25] access you
[159:28] um please make please purchase the
[159:32] invoice
[159:36] first please purchase the invoice so
[159:39] that
[159:42] is
[159:44] for
[159:48] uh if there are new users we're going to
[159:49] send an error message if they didn't
[159:51] make a purchase and on the dashboard we
[159:54] kind of want to import the button
[159:56] checkout and we're going to display it
[159:59] if the user doesn't have
[160:01] access so if the
[160:05] user can I get an invoice yeah
[160:09] here F and exoto here we're going to
[160:14] say
[160:17] no check
[160:22] out price idea config St plan
[160:28] yep but but but
[160:31] but yeah we have my account get Z voice
[160:35] we don't want to display that customers
[160:38] who've already made the purchase
[160:40] user has
[160:44] access
[160:54] if they don't have access
[161:03] yep which see how they
[161:07] look yeah okay he has access but if you
[161:11] don't have access you're going to see
[161:13] get inv voice okay here we might have to
[161:17] fix the redirect URL let's
[161:33] see location at HEV
[161:37] okay and here we're going to say success
[161:40] URL
[161:44] equal
[161:49] by default is going to be the success
[161:58] page but in our case on the dashboard we
[162:01] don't we want them to come back in the
[162:03] same exact
[162:05] page so we need to do something like
[162:08] success URL will
[162:14] be
[162:16] I
[162:18] think check out I think we can just use
[162:22] window location at H yeah the same exact
[162:32] page oh
[162:37] yeah it's going to
[162:44] be
[163:01] all right I think I'm going to change
[163:02] that and I'm going to do
[163:06] chome
[163:08] dashboard which in our case on the
[163:10] button
[163:12] checkout we're going to
[163:14] do
[163:21] simple and here success yourl
[163:25] from equal
[163:31] dashboard nope this is this one we want
[163:34] if it come from the dashboard we want
[163:36] this or we want the default success URL
[163:40] which is this
[163:42] one and a little like this
[163:46] so
[163:47] here um I shouldn't be able to do it
[163:49] because I already have an account but
[163:51] I'm going to give it a try normally I
[163:53] come back to the same
[163:57] page yeah I come back to the same page
[163:59] okay and on errors I also come back to
[164:03] the same page okay and I kind of want to
[164:07] try it uh dashboard if it doesn't have
[164:11] access okay we can remove it now if the
[164:14] user doesn't have
[164:16] is not in the dashboard
[164:19] here and go back to the success page
[164:23] okay I got my emails in the invoice
[164:27] okay that's
[164:30] perfect okay this is it I think um we
[164:33] have a
[164:35] proper oh I didn't know I can move that
[164:38] that was pretty
[164:39] sick um we have a peg wall before login
[164:43] thing um
[164:46] so people would pay receive a link and
[164:49] be able to log in after with the link
[164:51] hopefully that increases the conversion
[164:53] rate this is working well for
[164:57] shiest so we'll see how that goes for
[164:59] this one
[165:03] um I think we'll do a few things to
[165:06] finish that stream uh colors light
[165:10] making sure we have all the configs that
[165:12] are uh at the right place you only need
[165:15] that
[165:17] one oh maybe we can deploy the
[165:20] app yeah that could be fun
[165:24] um
[165:28] invoice is a uh
[165:33] stripe he still wants to uh talk about
[165:35] CH
[165:36] Fest TR
[165:44] invoices
[165:47] it's
[165:55] simple enter
[166:00] customers
[166:02] search edit and download
[166:09] Evo them
[166:11] cells then cells this will be
[166:15] added to some meta tages so I just want
[166:17] to make
[166:19] sure that makes
[166:23] sense okay uh the dashboard do we need
[166:25] metadata for the
[166:36] dashboard do we get here what
[166:44] are
[166:57] we have the
[166:58] [Music]
[167:00] title okay we need to make a micro edit
[167:04] to that part
[167:13] UMO we already in the Deo no we're not
[167:17] here we are and we are going to do
[167:25] this
[167:30] dashboard Das board Zen
[167:36] voice say need the dashboard page
[167:41] okay where I think we can we can
[167:48] start oh yeah we can start yeah we can
[167:50] push this live all right let's push this
[167:52] live so we have a landing
[167:54] page make sure where we have a landing
[167:56] page with a buy button and user accounts
[167:59] and then this should be working so let's
[168:02] give it a
[168:06] try
[168:08] check we're
[168:10] good who gr what are you using for
[168:12] styling any UI library or just tell CSS
[168:15] um mostly twin CSS but I'm using Daisy
[168:18] UI with the light theme that I customize
[168:23] which has a bunch of cool UI components
[168:25] this is what I use for all my
[168:27] startups and uh this is what I use for
[168:30] this doesn't look good but this is what
[168:31] I use for this
[168:33] page it's working pretty well like it
[168:37] it's simple what Discord server links
[168:40] though what are Discord server
[168:43] links as customers uh there the Discord
[168:48] server links if you're referring to the
[168:50] one for ship Fest it comes with the B
[168:52] plate so there is a uh you have to
[168:54] become a customer first to get
[168:56] it what would be your biggest advice for
[168:58] someone who is starting the solopreneur
[169:00] S business stry with no
[169:03] experience that's a tough question a
[169:05] long answer but mean starting uh really
[169:09] start making if you know how to code or
[169:12] don't know how to code whatever it
[169:13] doesn't matter but build something that
[169:16] anyone can use around you like something
[169:19] your parents could use your friends
[169:20] could use you could use if you have a
[169:22] job uh this is probably the best place
[169:24] you find startup idas because there's
[169:26] some money already flowing in your
[169:28] company so you know what are the
[169:30] problems you know you know things that
[169:32] could be automated you know some stuff
[169:34] that are boring can ask people around
[169:36] what's their most boring task of the day
[169:39] I think the best is to really get
[169:40] started with anything whatever this is
[169:42] just build something making make it fast
[169:45] like don't spend 6 months building an
[169:47] app do it pretty
[169:48] fast and and you should be
[169:53] good tog tobg why are you annoing me bro
[169:57] uh I don't know what you're referring to
[169:59] oh isn't CH fast your one time payment
[170:01] yeah I think I answered your question
[170:02] brother uh isn't sh your she fast one
[170:04] time payment it is a one time
[170:07] payment product so you pay once and you
[170:10] have unlimited access to it and one of
[170:13] my building um
[170:15] I recommend you to go on the YouTube
[170:17] video uh there is a link under the
[170:20] broadcast on Twitter the quality is
[170:22] better and there is the description of
[170:23] what we're building it is basically a
[170:25] stripe invoice uh editor and Generator
[170:29] for customers that was a business owner
[170:31] I have six six STP accounts my customers
[170:34] um often come back to me by email asking
[170:37] for an invoice and for um you know like
[170:39] they want to edit something on the
[170:40] invoice so I'm creating a unique link so
[170:43] I can send to my customers they input
[170:45] their email and they can retrieve all
[170:46] their invoices they can not download
[170:48] them and they can also edit them in the
[170:50] case
[170:53] uh yeah in the case you know that they
[170:55] make mistake on their name and they want
[170:57] to say oh my name is markl and not aw
[171:02] whatever this is pretty much it and then
[171:03] you download the invoice in Bingo you
[171:06] can do your accountability things
[171:08] without having to uh ask like with you
[171:11] can let your customers do their own
[171:13] thing with their invoices without having
[171:14] to retrieve them on your strip Dash
[171:17] board edit them by
[171:18] yourself uh just a little it's a it's a
[171:21] small product but um I would use it
[171:24] daily so it's quite important for
[171:30] me you
[171:33] reach oh wow we get 100
[171:36] messages on the chat today wow that's a
[171:38] big

[171:48] wine person hiding be be behind this uh
[171:51] this
[171:53] mustache hey yo Mike
[171:57] Martin so you get constant new users do
[172:01] I get constant new users uh yes I mean
[172:04] that's a good question obviously the
[172:05] fact there's no recuring for ship fast
[172:07] uh it means I never know what I'm going
[172:09] to get next month but to be frank Chast
[172:12] is probably the most
[172:15] constant and recuring startup that I've
[172:17] had uh obviously my Twitter helps and
[172:20] obviously when I tweet and and all that
[172:23] helps
[172:24] but it's been
[172:26] making consistently somewhere ranging
[172:29] between 40,000 per month to 60,000 and
[172:34] and it it keeps its constant like every
[172:36] day there will be sales every day I know
[172:39] there will be at least $500 worth of
[172:41] sales um up to sometimes 3,000 so it
[172:45] fluctuates a little bit but when you
[172:46] lift on a week it's very man it's very
[172:50] consistent so and I started removing
[172:53] onetime payment uh sorry removing
[172:56] subscriptions from my apps and I focus
[172:58] now on onetime payments and me this I
[173:01] think this is this is a game changer
[173:02] because there is a strong
[173:05] um subscription headache thing even if
[173:09] it's $10 just the fact that you're a
[173:10] customer and you think you're going to
[173:11] be using the product for a week and then
[173:13] you might have to cancel your
[173:14] subscription that creates some kind of
[173:16] uh reluctance to buying the product you
[173:18] have to think about it before and so
[173:21] onetime payments are um much easier to
[173:24] sell than recurring subscriptions and
[173:27] also uh you know it's like U from a
[173:30] customer standpoint I I personally I
[173:32] hate subscriptions like even if it's
[173:34] even that that little thing here that I
[173:36] have around my finger the aura ring it
[173:39] is it it's expensive it costs $400 and
[173:43] then they add a $5 per month
[173:46] subscription just so I can access the
[173:48] data on my phone and just that ju Just
[173:52] $5 I canceled my subscriptions it's it's
[173:56] just you know you feel like someone is
[173:58] leashing off you so if you are building
[174:02] some stuff online I really recommend you
[174:03] to try with one time payment and if you
[174:06] see there is some ongoing demand for
[174:08] support or for new features then it
[174:10] start to make sense to add subscriptions
[174:12] but it's much easier to get started with
[174:14] one time payment over uh recurring
[174:22] payments what can I share mine I think
[174:24] this is pretty much the same end I have
[174:26] probably 20 websites um I
[174:30] think I would say 10 to 15 of my
[174:33] websites intend to make
[174:35] money they have a direct like buy they
[174:37] have a buy button on the page six are
[174:40] making money and one is making good
[174:42] money so that's one out of 20 so that's
[174:48] roughly four to 5% but there is also
[174:50] something where uh Peter shared this 5%
[174:54] is success rate for his project I also
[174:57] think uh that the more you do it the
[175:03] more you get you you you get better at
[175:06] it and is that 5% is over his entire 10
[175:10] years uh career as a solopreneur but I
[175:13] I'm pretty sure they if you look at his
[175:15] last 10 projects I'm pretty sure five
[175:17] would be successful he would have a much
[175:19] higher hit rate than he used to have in
[175:20] the past and I have these similar also
[175:25] 2022 I think very two of my apps made
[175:28] money no made really good money and this
[175:31] I mean last year sorry 2023 then I
[175:33] shipped another 10 apps probably six of
[175:35] them made money and one made really good
[175:37] money so it it keeps going up as you get
[175:39] used to
[175:43] it
[175:47] sh yours what is the best pricing
[175:49] strategy for assess man I mean really
[175:51] I'm I'm I'm a change man I'm a onetime
[175:54] payment man I think it's much easier
[175:57] from a sales perspective and a Time
[176:00] perspective for you to code something
[176:01] that is onetime payment start with a
[176:03] onetime payment and build one feature
[176:05] out of your entire SS the feature that
[176:07] you think is the most important ship
[176:10] your SAS with this one time payment and
[176:12] one feature and see the market reacts if
[176:15] it's a flop you can ship another feature
[176:17] and relaunch it but I think starting
[176:20] with subscription it just makes
[176:22] everything a little bit harder so I
[176:24] would start with onetime payments and
[176:26] see how the users react to that so for
[176:28] instance for my B PL chip
[176:31] fast I've had a lot of people asking why
[176:34] don't you try to do some recurring
[176:36] memberships or some you know like
[176:38] something that you could charge monthly
[176:41] if I had started with a monthly
[176:42] recurring subscription for sh fast I I'm
[176:44] pretty sure it would have never worked
[176:46] the way it did and now that I've have
[176:49] been running this uh product for 5
[176:51] months I feel like there is no need for
[176:53] a subscription whatsoever so I just
[176:55] leave it as it is as a onetime payment I
[176:57] increase the price as I add more
[176:59] features but that's it and it's still
[177:01] selling but for other tools if I feel
[177:03] like customers keeps coming back and
[177:05] they're like oh yeah we would would like
[177:07] to have this feature or um like for
[177:10] instance me Ling which is a ling P
[177:12] generator uh which I sold because I
[177:14] could I didn't know how to grow it but I
[177:16] had customer feedback I had customers
[177:19] asking me for new features so when you
[177:21] have something like this it could make
[177:23] sense to have a subscription I think
[177:25] it's smart to get started with one time
[177:27] payment and finally switch with
[177:33] subscriptions cl cl I love your name man
[177:36] uh which platform do I use for my
[177:38] applications AWS digital oan I use
[177:40] mostly uh mostly next year s where I
[177:44] have my
[177:46] API and my front end is hosted there so
[177:49] nextjs I have a mongodb uh database
[177:53] somewhere and if I need some like heavy
[177:56] storage or whatever I'm going to use
[177:58] AWS and how long ago did I start coding
[178:01] think I might I I think I touched code
[178:04] for the first time six or seven years
[178:05] ago I did some really terrible coding
[178:08] for like three to four years I learned
[178:10] Frameworks before learning JavaScript
[178:13] and then about 3 years ago uh I tried to
[178:15] get a job which I got fired 6 months
[178:17] later but at least I restarted the
[178:19] journey learning properly and it's been
[178:22] three years pretty much where I code
[178:24] like I wouldn't say Cersei but I I code
[178:26] legit
[178:28] legit you think it's good to build
[178:30] something for other Indie funders you
[178:32] think it's good to build something for
[178:33] Yes man if you especially if you're
[178:35] getting started you know Indie funders
[178:38] we have a community we talk with each
[178:40] other we knows each other's face so it's
[178:42] much easier to sell them something
[178:43] because you're not a stranger from the
[178:45] internet and you might you also know
[178:47] what they want because you're one of
[178:48] them so it's much easier to start with a
[178:51] community you know over um random
[178:54] markets unless you have let's say a job
[178:56] and you are very good at uh this side of
[178:59] your job and you know you know what the
[179:00] market wants but yeah building a l tool
[179:02] for IND funders is
[179:06] smart
[179:09] Le oh dude
[179:11] okay I'm going to I'm going to have to
[179:14] um go back to uh my editor code editor
[179:19] otherwise this this this uh I'm not
[179:22] going to build much today on this uh
[179:24] this is going to turn into a live
[179:26] conversation which I love too but we
[179:29] have an app to finish with Friday
[179:30] so uh it's time to deploy I
[179:35] guess which um and then I'm going to go
[179:39] to my versal and start to import the
[179:43] projects
[179:50] Z
[179:53] here
[179:55] [Music]
[179:56] and all right I think we'll
[180:05] need should I do my variables now now I
[180:09] I'm going to deploy it's going to
[180:12] bug okay
[180:14] too
[180:26] bad so we're going to
[180:28] need to set up a database so probably
[180:31] going to do that right
[180:40] now instead of the database uh we have
[180:43] have already set up the
[180:45] emails we probably need yeah we will'll
[180:47] need to set up oh yeah that will be
[180:50] a boring part but I kind of have to
[180:52] activate my
[180:56] accounts okay I'm going to do
[181:04] that this is deployed of
[181:07] course inspect deployment yeah of course
[181:10] that wouldn't work because we don't have
[181:12] any
[181:15] um all right first let's start with the
[181:42] database let's start a new
[181:45] project which we are going to call Zen
[181:51] voice Pro on Mark
[182:06] Loop deployments and going to go for the
[182:10] free version going to set it up uh
[182:14] oh well did it oh no okay this still
[182:18] here yep Bluster zero tag
[182:23] creates little
[182:27] cchat I'm going to have to turn off
[182:30] my screen for a minute just the time I
[182:33] uh set up the right uh
[182:42] passwords
[182:58] uh database is somewhere here where
[183:01] deploying your changes okay um right I'm
[183:04] also going to have
[183:06] to uh prepare the stripe account so I
[183:10] need to provide my business information
[183:12] which I'm going to keep private for
[183:14] the sake of my
[183:17] uh whatever uh so I will just keep
[183:21] showing my my stupid face for a little
[183:23] while and I will get back to my screen
[183:26] as soon as this is
[183:42] done
[183:49] a business needs a
[184:12] company
[184:18] ch ch ch Ching
[184:20] CH actually this should take about uh
[184:23] five minutes I will uh share the screen
[184:26] as soon as I am done with all
[184:33] that Zen
[184:41] voice. okay we've haded the those
[184:45] variables the database is being deployed
[184:48] and I am sending up the company in
[184:52] stripe this is very
[185:12] boring
[185:21] s and
[185:23] edites for their
[185:33] clients okay striple not that is a fun
[185:36] thing I just discovered stripe will not
[185:38] let me move
[185:41] on until I we
[185:44] have uh a domain name set up so I'll
[185:47] have to set this up
[185:49] first which we're going to do Zen
[185:55] voice. and we are going to go back to
[185:57] name chip and add those
[186:09] records and
[186:12] record
[186:15] [Music]
[186:20] we going to
[186:42] do
[186:45] this and a name
[187:02] ww
[187:06] okay where are the records oh okay now
[187:09] they here okay these should
[187:13] this should potentially work now we're
[187:15] going to I think the database is yeah
[187:17] the database is
[187:19] ready okay I am going
[187:22] to integration I
[187:25] think yep
[187:36] configure link
[187:39] clusters I'm going to link uh Zenvo
[187:45] Atlas cluster cluster Z to Zenvo project
[187:49] I understand enable nope and then they
[187:54] should add the
[187:57] connection like link whatever to versal
[188:00] so I don't have to do it
[188:04] manually uh Zen voice. I is it actually
[188:07] the domain I bot zvo or yeah zvo
[188:12] or
[188:16] it's surprisingly
[188:22] slow see if that's
[188:25] connected Zeno is connected to Zeno so
[188:28] yeah we have the variable that's
[188:31] here um we might restart the deployments
[188:35] now I think we have all the
[188:40] required variables that might be strike
[188:43] that's missing that's probably the only
[188:45] thing
[188:50] um where are
[188:54] we domain domain domain here we
[188:58] go okay we're generating SSL
[189:01] certificates
[189:03] and domain is connected and we are going
[189:06] to
[189:09] deploy it should be
[189:11] working nice okay it is
[189:20] working
[189:22] yep all right so I'm going to go back to
[189:25] my strap
[189:26] account going to show you my stupid face
[189:29] for a little
[189:33] while so I can
[189:41] normally still know the domain is still
[189:43] not
[189:43] [Music]
[189:46] available come on
[189:51] veral oh I think this maybe the
[189:54] certificate is not available what is
[190:01] it
[190:05] okay okay we are live the domain name is
[190:09] actually
[190:11] live
[190:21] okay
[190:26] this see
[190:41] you
[191:07] stripe account almost done working on
[191:11] it uh Zen short
[191:29] descriptor uh oh yeah I need to connect
[191:32] my bank as
[191:35] well damn
[191:41] it
[192:06] think I need to connect the bank and as
[192:07] soon as I'm done with that I will have
[192:11] to
[192:15] yeah I will have to do um the variables
[192:19] like webbook Secrets API keys and we
[192:24] should be
[192:39] good
[192:41] okay
[193:02] software let keep right
[193:03] [Music]
[193:11] now
[193:20] oh
[193:21] boy think this is new social security
[193:24] number I have to provide my social
[193:25] security number to create a trip
[193:30] accounts damn
[193:40] it um
[193:44] remember what is
[193:56] it numer the security
[194:05] so it's taking more time to set up a
[194:08] strip account to build that
[194:11] tool
[194:19] requirements and made okay now I have to
[194:22] proide I promise I'll be there
[194:35] soon um certificate reg of I see
[194:41] y
[194:52] um still
[194:54] not
[194:56] certification
[195:11] okay
[195:20] document
[195:21] submitted
[195:25] save and final

[198:19] is API stripe
[198:23] API book okay we have this we put the
[198:28] endpoints and we're going to listen to
[198:30] check out
[198:32] completed
[198:36] events we at the end point we copy the
[198:39] signning
[198:41] secret
[198:43] and we pass this
[198:45] inversal we save and we should be
[198:52] good
[198:55] okay it's time to show you the real
[198:58] deal
[199:00] um here we
[199:02] go going to redeploy
[199:10] that yep we have any the yeah oh wait
[199:13] let me check TR is sending me another
[199:15] little
[199:18] message no further action is
[199:20] required information in review
[199:24] okay okay that is
[199:35] good okay wow there's a lot of things
[199:37] here what is going on
[199:40] uh okay
[199:45] okay um we're going to need to create a
[199:49] price uh
[199:52] somewhere maybe we should question Mr
[199:55] kov have you guys
[200:10] yes
[200:15] see I'm asking D I'm asking this man
[200:22] here pring for pring for
[200:30] Zenvo I'm asking him what he thinks for
[200:33] the price I I think and as a user I
[200:36] think anything under $49 would be a good
[200:40] pricing one time payment
[200:45] so let's see if that
[200:51] answers if you guys have any clue as
[200:53] well um let me know what pricing you
[200:55] think would be fair for

[213:40] it's it should be set up customer

[214:29] invoice
[214:31] and is it auto save yeah think it
[214:36] is okay all
[214:39] saved
[214:41] yeah email payments and refunds
[214:43] okay oh yeah I'm going to dog food my
[214:46] own little products here but now that
[214:49] this is live I kind of want to avoid
[214:53] having uh
[214:55] some
[214:57] potential uh fraudulent
[215:00] payments which means I am going to
[215:02] create this a little I have to turn off
[215:06] my screen because I'm going to uh show
[215:08] some API keys but I am going to protect
[215:11] my new trip business with um by bu
[215:17] dispute uh
[215:19] which is going to check uh listen to e
[215:22] webbook events on my accounts and if
[215:26] there are some brulant ones is going
[215:30] to dodge
[215:33] them count added
[215:39] um
[215:43] okay now I can show my screen no more
[215:45] API
[215:46] Keys yep uh no the name is a bit
[215:50] confusing or maybe that's because I'm
[215:52] French and I speak with a really weird
[215:55] accent but it's by like bye-bye
[215:58] disputes.
[216:00] comom I don't if I can share the link
[216:04] here let me
[216:09] see
[216:11] can I engage with my old stream yep I
[216:14] can oh yeah this is
[216:18] it um so it's a little demo it works
[216:23] exactly the same as uh Zeno which I just
[216:27] made where I uploaded a strip restricted
[216:30] API key so by dispute has limited access
[216:33] to um
[216:35] Zeno so as you can see here as I added
[216:39] the products if I go to developer mode I
[216:41] will see that my webbook it added a new
[216:45] webbook listener on bu dispute which now
[216:49] if I add rules in here is going to
[216:51] listen to those webook events and make
[216:54] sure that uh if something weird
[216:58] fraudulent uh strange happens is going
[217:00] to prevent action so I always set up all
[217:03] the rules uh and I'm going to refund and
[217:05] send alert there's no subscription so I
[217:08] don't need to do that
[217:11] I'm going to add this going to add this
[217:14] rule uh this rule as
[217:19] well to add the card stolen and if
[217:24] uh those those events are the most
[217:27] common usually um for instance if a if a
[217:30] customer pays with if someone uh steal a
[217:32] credit card which happens a lot and
[217:35] decide to test a credit card with small
[217:37] amounts of money on your site um
[217:41] um the payment will go through and
[217:44] you'll be happy you'll get a sale but
[217:45] later I don't like a few days later when
[217:48] the customer report the credit card
[217:51] stolen you normally will get an event on
[217:54] stripe that says this card has been
[217:57] reported um stolen from someone so we
[217:59] recommend you to refund the payments uh
[218:01] stripe will not automatically refund for
[218:03] you but bu dispute will listen to this
[218:05] event and if you activate this rule here
[218:08] you just add the rule and whenever there
[218:10] is a credit card stolen even sent to my
[218:13] zen Voice account is going to refund the
[218:16] payment and also send me an email alert
[218:19] and if a dispute arise I don't need to
[218:21] do
[218:23] much
[218:26] um yeah I think I'm pretty good to
[218:30] go I will probably change this to be my
[218:33] personal invoice personal
[218:39] email now making sure that and you see
[218:48] crit okay yeah I'm receiving those
[218:51] emails perfect and going back
[218:54] here keep it so my zen invoice account
[218:58] is set up
[219:00] yep back to it I think we're
[219:04] good
[219:07] um myp set up
[219:13] login log outs what do we have to do oh
[219:16] let's write the login
[219:19] flow payments are made
[219:21] okay and if I log in
[219:24] here type my
[219:27] email uh it doesn't find
[219:36] it normally I should get that yeah
[219:39] signning to Zen invoice
[219:42] uh which one is this though I sent two
[219:44] emails why
[219:47] so

[220:14] need to update this logo because I am
[220:17] not uh working on Shi Fest now so the
[220:20] button checkout should have a
[220:23] little uh I think I you react Lucid
[220:27] [Music]
[220:32] icon what is the name of the icon
[220:34] airplane
[220:36] maybe nope uh
[220:39] Arrow
[220:44] o Dam
[220:47] it paper PL oh there we
[220:50] go could be the
[220:54] gs6 SVG maybe we are going to change the
[220:58] icon here and instead we're going to
[221:01] display that
[221:06] one we going to do something super cute
[221:09] that I shouldn't
[221:11] doing
[221:14] but it's
[221:21] okay
[221:23] um let's see the button check out button
[221:27] here is an

[221:56] part it's slightly
[221:59] big let's make it 18
[222:06] pixels group over and we're going to say
[222:09] Translate
[222:10] x uh maybe
[222:13] two need to
[222:15] rotate this is absolutely useless but
[222:17] it's pretty cute okay just maybe
[222:21] 0.5
[222:38] okay
[222:44] all
[222:46] right this is a very important this is
[222:48] how you make sucess how you build
[222:50] successful
[222:51] softwares this has this little p paper
[222:54] plane icon and translate
[222:58] x05 people will definitely convert to
[223:00] pay customers after seeing
[223:03] them stupid
[223:07] stuff okay this is good um
[223:10] yeah okay we can try okay let's try if
[223:12] all the links are available so yeah
[223:16] right
[223:17] now I'm opening my zen uh okay I need to
[223:22] turn off just for that I'll create a
[223:23] I'll try with all my
[223:27] products so I'm going to create a few
[223:30] restricted API keys for um ship FAS by
[223:33] disputes Zen voice and try to test see

[225:06] same
[225:08] time okay to speak and work is that's
[225:11] the proof you just speak and work at the
[225:13] same
[225:15] time uh browse

[227:08] that
[227:19] where are
[227:20] we yes yes yes yes yes
[227:38] yes
[228:08] s

[228:27] the okay um so this is
[228:32] yil good evening it is actually almost
[228:37] yeah almost evening time be time for a
[228:39] little serf session good evening
[228:41] man so we have uh so it is live um as
[228:45] you can see here I just added three
[228:48] stripe accounts to my new Zenvo
[228:52] dashboard it automatically fetch the I
[228:55] just input the API key and it will fetch
[228:58] the how do you call that the name the
[229:01] logo and all those kind of
[229:04] information and if I get a now I'll get
[229:06] a link if I send my link to customer
[229:10] they can input their email address and
[229:12] retrieve their invoices so we're going
[229:13] to give it a try except that this is not
[229:15] working because the link doesn't give me
[229:19] this is not the right link let's see
[229:22] yeah I don't get my private link so I
[229:24] think I have a little bug in the code
[229:27] somewhere copy
[229:32] link process go
[229:37] production process then urement
[229:39] production
[229:41] equal oh I know what I've done okay yeah
[229:43] this is
[229:54] it let's see if that works
[229:58] better this is still working and if this
[230:01] is different from
[230:06] production inv voice okay
[230:15] F and let's push this
[230:18] up see if we get
[230:23] anything
[230:27] deployments quick question not sure if
[230:29] you already answered as a French where
[230:30] did you move your company I'm a similar
[230:32] situation with taxes a lot since two
[230:35] month well by the way you moved a lot
[230:37] since two days already thanks man
[230:41] um I cannot disclose much at the moment
[230:44] because I'm doing the transition um and
[230:46] it's not really good also to just
[230:48] disclose where your setup I will as soon
[230:51] as I'm done with everything I'm going to
[230:55] um write a little newsletter that
[230:56] explain everything that I've done and
[230:57] everything that I've learned
[231:00] um I'm I'm leaving France I'm going to
[231:03] uh I'm going to set up everything here
[231:05] in Asia because this is where I spend
[231:06] most of my time per year there are two
[231:09] separate things one is you have your
[231:11] personal taxes like as a where are you a
[231:14] tax resident and that is based on where
[231:16] you spend at least six months per year
[231:19] uh this has nothing to do with your
[231:20] company this is just a personal thing so
[231:23] as I spend most of my time in Indonesia
[231:24] I should pay my taxes here I was paying
[231:27] my taxes in France so far and I'm going
[231:29] to move here and there is the business
[231:31] thing which uh um you can have anywhere
[231:34] you want for me I use trip so it has to
[231:36] be a us business Singapore um
[231:39] um I think Dubai and all that probably
[231:42] work with strap as well so yeah it's two
[231:45] separate things and I'm in the process
[231:47] of doing both at the moment and it's
[231:49] boring as
[231:55]  okay
[231:57] um yeah let's refresh the page and see
[231:59] if we get a better link we do
[232:03] perfect this this is the first time I
[232:06] test this live I would be extremely
[232:08] surprised if this this is
[232:10] working we still going to give it a try
[232:13] so uh if I put an email do I
[232:17] get well I don't get an error from the
[232:20] API which is good it means there is a
[232:23] little something working uh I found an
[232:26] invoice from a customers that didn't pay
[232:27] I'm going to see if that does
[232:30] anything man this is working oh they
[232:33] should not be paid
[232:36] though man this is working I'm so happy
[232:42] sh oh this is
[232:44] beautiful and the invoice here oh
[232:48] man there's no way this is that
[232:53] simple to discounts does yeah it all
[232:57] makes sense this is exactly what it
[232:59] is
[233:03]  that is a really happy SM
[233:07] here
[233:09] uh why does all right I'm going to turn
[233:13] off the screen for just a minute I need
[233:15] to go and check those customers
[233:18] data
[233:20] um why is the invoice paid even though
[233:24] it was
[233:37] cancelled
[233:50] status created d m
[233:52] filter customer
[234:07] ID
[234:09] how come you give me this Aid invoice
[234:11] even though he didn't pay
[234:26] uh right stripe Mark the invoice as
[234:31] paid please
[234:34] explain let's check the invoice and see
[234:37] what we get here
[234:44] okay now that's actually a different
[234:45] customers what have I done
[235:00] here okay okay okay
[235:03] okay okay those are two separate
[235:05] customers
[235:07] apparently
[235:09] okay so I think oh
[235:12] boy this is legendary this is so this is
[235:15] a self congratulation
[235:17] time but this is
[235:20] working business Indie page amount this
[235:23] is absolutely working man this is so
[235:32] good get invoice oh
[235:35] boy get edits download the invoice
[235:45] oh
[235:47] boy sick okay well I think well um I'm
[235:52] pumped uh thing this is perfect time to
[235:55] end up the stream this way uh as a as a
[235:59] quick recap uh we have finished the
[236:02] product uh I will have to test with
[236:05] other accounts other emails making sure
[236:07] that there there are no bugs uh probably
[236:09] some beta tested to some of my friends
[236:11] to see if that
[236:13] works
[236:15] and and I think yeah and we're we're
[236:18] good and we're really good so the next
[236:20] part is building the landing page uh
[236:23] this is probably the most important part
[236:25] because uh those three days of work will
[236:28] be totally useless if I don't have a
[236:30] proper landing page uh this is ring I
[236:32] used to struggle a I mean I still
[236:34] struggle a lot as a developer but I have
[236:36] made some little progress and I'm going
[236:38] to try to to share live here uh tomorrow
[236:41] and after tomorrow how to uh you know
[236:44] make a uh appealing Ling page so you
[236:47] poent you potentially get customers and
[236:50] that would be really fun if I get no
[236:51] paying customers at all for this
[236:53] product I'll will destroy all my
[236:55] credibility but uh at least I put my
[236:58] skin in the game uh I will stay around
[237:00] for a few more minutes if you guys have
[237:02] any questions uh before I end up the
[237:04] stream and I go for a little uh surf
[237:07] session for sunset
[237:10] looking forward to think I'll
[237:15] finish did you start building sass did
[237:17] you just randomly start or did you have
[237:19] a
[237:20] plan I I had no plan uh if you are
[237:26] curious I wrote about it
[237:29] here my first I think it's called My
[237:32] First doll
[237:33] online yeah this is it I'm going to show
[237:36] you the link on YouTube if you're
[237:38] curious this is is exactly how I made my
[237:40] first um software and how I monetize it
[237:44] how I get my first
[237:45] customers the link right
[237:48] here
[237:51] um so basically I was I was completely
[237:55] broke and I was burned out from like big
[237:58] um you know uh VC stuff like I did some
[238:00] VC stuff it didn't work I thought I Mark
[238:02] I was I thought of Mark zuberg and it
[238:03] didn't work as well and I want to do
[238:05] something very simple a friend of mine
[238:06] told me just sell your software before
[238:09] you build it so I wouldn't spend six
[238:11] months building a software that nobody
[238:12] wants which is what I did I sent some
[238:14] cod emails I finally ended up having a
[238:16] call with someone who uh wanted to try
[238:19] the product and after the call they
[238:21] ended up paying and uh I started to
[238:23] build the product I had no idea how to
[238:25] make good products it was a pretty
[238:26] terrible code but it was working for the
[238:28] End customer and just like this I grew a
[238:31] little software and I think I was at a
[238:34] $1,000 uh monthly recing revenue for a
[238:38] year and then the second year I grew to
[238:41] 4,000 M recing revenue and then Co
[238:44] happened and I was working with physical
[238:46] businesses that have to that had to
[238:47] close due to covid and my set went to
[238:49] zero in a week
[238:52] basically that was pretty much the end
[238:54] of it uh it's still running now it's
[238:55] still paying uh some of my bills it's
[238:57] like uh until last year he was paying
[239:00] like six to 700 bucks a month and now
[239:03] it's paying $200 a month but it's zero
[239:06] managements and it's pure uh passive
[239:09] income if I may and and
[239:12] yeah how did I solve the snn issue on
[239:16] stripe what is could you clarify what is
[239:18] s SN
[239:23] issue my product you also respond to
[239:26] this whing with whining customers from
[239:28] my product or you just build a software
[239:31] here are you talking about winning
[239:33] customers like getting customers
[239:35] or or whining customers I'm not sure
[239:38] because I'm French and I don't know
[239:40] what's the difference between those two
[239:42] the Social Security uh I'm I'm French so
[239:46] uh I have a Social Security number uh
[239:48] it's on my uh green card I just provide
[239:51] this and it
[239:53] works how would you approach growing a
[239:55] tool if you had only 80 followers only
[239:57] man I started with zero
[239:59] followers uh literally for it took me 8
[240:02] month to get 1,000 followers so just so
[240:04] you know uh we somehow we all start
[240:07] there
[240:10] it's it's at the beginning you will need
[240:12] to have small wins to grow your
[240:14] followers so you will need to build your
[240:16] Tool uh you'll need to launch it on
[240:18] hicker news product hunt reddits
[240:20] whatever need and you will for some
[240:23] reason what of your post will go viral
[240:24] and you will tweet about it and people
[240:26] will be start to notice and that's how
[240:28] you're going to grow your tool at at the
[240:31] beginning yeah you need to have this
[240:33] little WIS here or there you need to be
[240:35] authentic you need to be different you
[240:37] need to have a good product you need to
[240:38] have a product that solve a real problem
[240:41] um I think this is where I would I would
[240:45] start hey Mark would you recommend to
[240:47] create an audience Twitter like the one
[240:49] you have since zero I feel like nobody
[240:51] cares about my IDs and
[240:53] projects tough question again uh I
[240:57] really I really do my best to share
[240:58] everything I learn in the newsletter
[241:00] there's a link on YouTube you can see it
[241:03] uh I made a few posts about growing on
[241:05] Twitter um how to make better
[241:07] screenshots how to write tweets uh
[241:09] what's working on Twitter what's not
[241:11] working um but again if you are a I
[241:13] assume you're a maker so you use no code
[241:15] or coding whatever but you as soon you
[241:17] create
[241:18] product so your way of growing will be
[241:22] making either really good products or
[241:24] product that go viral or sharing
[241:26] something that's new but I think it's
[241:29] yeah you have you have to for me what
[241:33] worked is I I showed up every single day
[241:37] for a year making those products sharing
[241:40] them every time I will make a product I
[241:41] will launch it everywhere Hacker News um
[241:44] product hunt I'll do my best
[241:47] so at some point something will happen
[241:51] people would see it people would notice
[241:53] and this will slowly grow your following
[241:56] and at the same time I believe learning
[241:58] how to write properly on Twitter is a
[242:01] good thing that would really help you
[242:03] because I see a bunch of tweets that are
[242:05] either too long or too not well
[242:07] constructed
[242:09] so learning how to write good tweets is
[242:12] I think is important is going to help
[242:14] you uh faster this growth and and just
[242:18] Justin Welsh is for me the goat just
[242:22] look at his content uh he's not a
[242:24] startup Pro like programmer guy but just
[242:27] look at the format of his tweet and how
[242:29] much meaning he's able to give with just
[242:32] three lines this is a huge inspiration
[242:34] for me and I think it could be for
[242:36] pretty much everyone because doesn't
[242:38] really
[242:39] matter what you say as long as you say
[242:41] it well you already get some people
[242:44] listening then if you have a good
[242:45] meaning after that then you have a good
[242:49] combo where you deploy your application
[242:51] assuming they're re they're all buit all
[242:53] bit using nexj yes this is uh versal man
[242:57] all my apps are on versal you can see
[243:01] here this is the last one I just
[243:04] launched it's all there and uh I pay
[243:08] probably $25 a month for
[243:10] russal U so this is really
[243:13] fair you think is the most
[243:16] important you hey Mark I really like
[243:18] your stream thank you man where do you
[243:20] think is the most important trait of
[243:24] soloers D I mean some people would say
[243:26] you different things but for me
[243:29] just learn how to have fun and show up
[243:33] show up daily and find find your own
[243:37] touch
[243:43] is perhaps quite
[243:45] interesting CH of
[243:51] nature your philosophy is to ship fast
[243:54] but isn't that costly with fees
[243:56] associated with domain name hosting
[243:58] making 10 apps can have a toll on the
[244:02] wallet I think it depends on your stack
[244:04] but for me all my apps are hosted on
[244:07] versal which is $20 per month I use
[244:11] analytics with plausible I think uh it
[244:14] is some I think I pay $30 per
[244:18] month U and you would probably pay less
[244:20] at the beginning because you're getting
[244:21] started and you would have less
[244:23] traffic my database is free uh my entire
[244:27] business my $55,000 a month business
[244:30] runs on a $250 a month
[244:34] stack that's that's really minimal and
[244:36] in that in these 200 $150 that I spent I
[244:39] include beeh for my newsletter which is
[244:41] 100 bucks I include uh 99 bucks for my
[244:45] affiliate program for ship Fest which
[244:47] you also don't need at the beginning so
[244:48] you can remove those 200 bucks and I
[244:51] think I would spend if I remove those
[244:52] two which you don't need I would spend
[244:54] something like 50 or 60 bucks per
[244:58] month and I always buy uh yeah yeah my
[245:01] domain names are I never buy fancy
[245:03] domain names u i mean not fancy but like
[245:05] I never buy short domain names orcom
[245:07] domain names so I I they cost like
[245:10] somewhere from 10 to 30 bucks per year
[245:13] it's pretty fair at the
[245:18] beginning how many product how new
[245:20] products come to your mind in X time do
[245:22] you think
[245:23] about do you think about them or you
[245:25] just build the one that you need in the
[245:27] moment uh I both I think about them all
[245:30] the time uh and the more tools I build
[245:33] the more IDs I have uh as you can see
[245:36] this Zenvo thing would never exist if I
[245:39] didn't have if I didn't build those 20
[245:42] websites and what I do is whenever I
[245:45] have an ID in mine I try to refining
[245:47] just a little bit see if that's doable
[245:50] if uh I have some kind of an edge for
[245:52] marketing for this if it's some kind of
[245:54] like random AI tool for different
[245:56] industries that I have no idea about I
[245:58] know it's going to be hard to Market so
[245:59] I can of ditch it but if the tool is
[246:02] comping if I think I have an edge for
[246:04] marketing I'll put it on my to-do list
[246:07] and then I would when I want to build an
[246:09] app I'll just go on my to-do list and
[246:11] look at the one that is usually the
[246:13] latest because that's the one I had in
[246:15] my mind the latest and I would build
[246:18] it there also some more um validation to
[246:22] that uh I I try to filter IDs where uh
[246:26] if if I have a startup ID that requires
[246:29] for instance human maintenance or that
[246:31] requires me to show up every day I'll
[246:33] ditch it um if this is an idea for a
[246:36] market I don't know anything about I'll
[246:37] ditch it if this is a vitamin product I
[246:40] will ditch it um I I really try to have
[246:43] a filter for IDs that I build and that
[246:46] helped
[246:47] me build more successful product this
[246:51] year over the last
[246:55] years how do you design L how do you
[246:57] design landing pages on your app do you
[247:00] use any templates I am developer and I
[247:02] find hard to have a good design any tips
[247:04] man yeah I am a developer too and I suck
[247:06] at design and it's only recently that I
[247:09] studed to have some simple UI that
[247:13] worked better gets the boot the book
[247:16] called refactoring
[247:21] UI get this book man this
[247:24] is really really really good book it's
[247:27] super simple there's no much uh noise
[247:29] you're not going to see fancy stuff it
[247:32] is uh just get it it's really good get
[247:36] inspired from landing pages that are
[247:38] working go see Danny pma's landing pages
[247:41] are really beautiful uh Tony Dean too um
[247:44] and many others so look at those uh and
[247:49] and in the end try to remove things it's
[247:53] a bit cliche but like don't try to be
[247:56] cute but try to be clear uh re
[248:00] like the least like if you look at my
[248:02] landing pages now they have less sting
[248:04] on the page they have the typical
[248:06] structure of headline sub headline or
[248:08] like description and a photo and then
[248:11] everything will be replicated like this
[248:12] I try to really remove any clutter any
[248:15] complicated UI you can also get inspired
[248:18] by Tailwind UI
[248:23] components see if I find
[248:32] it this library of yeah it's all
[248:35] Tailwind um and look at their component
[248:37] or their templates um keep in mind that
[248:40] they are extremely good designers and
[248:42] there are a lot of things you won't be
[248:43] able to do but you could literally take
[248:47] this mockup here and this would look
[248:49] like a good hero section for your page
[248:51] without going into adding gradients or
[248:54] colors or icons or whatever this would
[248:56] work
[249:02] well where yeah I think that would
[249:05] answer the question for uh design
[249:07] inspiration from usually
[249:09] high it's my
[249:12] name Mr
[249:15] stack all right I think we're good uh
[249:19] it's 4 4:20 p.m. in belly the product is
[249:22] done uh it's going to be dark I think
[249:24] I'm going to go for a little surf
[249:25] session before it's fully dark I uh a
[249:30] lot of fun here building today tomorrow
[249:31] we'll build the landing page for his
[249:33] invoice and we should be able to launch
[249:35] by Friday probably next Monday we'll be
[249:37] on product 10
[249:38] uh thank you everyone for showing up I
[249:40] hope I'll see you in tomorrow's stream
[249:47] cheers
