[00:00] after watching your videos he found it really 
inspiring for me this is The Pinacle of Happiness  
[00:06] converts as much as we made almost 5K in the 
past 24 hours wo this will likely never happen
[00:18] [Music] again okay it's very cliche but 
there's no better feeling that knowing  
[00:26] we're traveling and we're going 
to make money while traveling and  
[00:30] more money than what you're going 
to spend wow it's already [Music]
[00:36] Christmas there's a locker cannot steal my [Music]
[00:47] airp we just landed in Lisbon Portugal we're 
looking for new house after B and uh this  
[01:00] is our first step so I have launched a new product 
Cod fast maybe two or 3 weeks ago something like  
[01:08] this and I wanted to mention about the lending 
page conversion rate which at the moment is really  
[01:13] good if we look at the data here we can see that 
the uh revenue generated per visitor is around $4  
[01:19] which is by far the best product I've ever built 
and in terms of conversion and the conversion  
[01:25] rate at 1.8% is also really good uh so there are 
here a few things that I do when I launch a new  
[01:31] product to make sure that it converts as much as 
possible because well I want to leverage as much  
[01:36] traffic that I bring make sure that I get as many 
uh customers as possible from those landing pages  
[01:41] one of the first thing I do which really hurts 
but it's necessary is that um 24 hours after  
[01:47] launching a new product so this is the launch 
tweet on November 28th I quote that tweet and  
[01:53] I asked if you visited my website why you did not 
purchase another important part here is to mention  
[01:59] that I am why I'm asking this question and why 
should people answer in the most and honest way  
[02:06] because in general people will try to be nice 
and give you like good feedback but what I want  
[02:10] as an entrepreneur and what helps me most is 
that when people tell me what is bad what is  
[02:15] wrong what are the objections what's exactly in 
their mind and so here I really try to mention  
[02:19] like be brutal like tell me honestly because 
this is going to help me and I've got really  
[02:26] good feedback like people really being actually 
honest and telling me exactly why they didn't  
[02:30] purchase and sometimes I land on something that 
can actually help improve my landing page here  
[02:36] what uh this person mentioned is that they 
don't believe the promise I make on the site  
[02:42] about building a software from zero in 14 days 
and based on those feedback I went back to the  
[02:47] landing page and then previously it was something 
like build your software in 14 days and then I  
[02:52] realized well actually if you have a 9 to5 and 
you have 5 minutes per day you might not be able  
[02:57] to build your product from zero in 14 days days 
the results you get with a with a course equals  
[03:02] the amount of efforts you input and I don't want 
to overpromise so I try to go with another angle  
[03:07] which is more about not learning everything you 
need to become a software engineer but learning  
[03:12] just what you need to become an entrepreneur to 
build product as an entrepreneur and so blend  
[03:17] like big bold move the most important part of the 
website the headline I changed it right after the  
[03:22] launch like 24 hours after the launch I changed 
the the entire headline and I replac it by learn  
[03:27] to code in weeks not month and another part here 
that was important the course is made for people  
[03:32] who want to launch an online business to create 
an online business with code um I use the word  
[03:37] SAS previously build your SAS in 14 days which 
I believe is a little bit too Niche like not  
[03:44] everybody knows what a SAS is but people want 
to build their idea with code and so I went for  
[03:49] something more generic which is about learning 
how to code and not building a sess and back  
[03:54] to that feedback from uh this person It also says 
that they don't trust it's possible to do it this  
[03:59] fast so what I did is U when you scroll through 
the site you'll see I added an entirely new  
[04:05] section this one that says wait is it possible 
to learn to code that fast and so here what I  
[04:11] do is I take what's inside of a random visitor's 
head objections the the number one objection is it  
[04:19] possible and I try to answer it using a little 
story so here I go over um you know my coding  
[04:25] journey of why learning on Udi was not a good 
fit for me um all the the stuff that we learn  
[04:31] that we actually don't use and then I explained 
that now in 2024 using AI things are much easier  
[04:37] and then I conclude by explaining why it is 
possible to learn how to build a tiny product  
[04:42] within 14 days okay another things I do which is 
concertive like we uh solopreneur mentioned about  
[04:48] the freedom like uh working asynchronously not 
answering emails I do the exact opposite below the  
[04:54] pricing section there is a section uh fq section 
where if people have a question they can contact  
[04:59] me by email this could be insane for some people 
because then I would I sometimes get 100 emails  
[05:05] per day this is really good because this is where 
I get some gems if you look at my emails when I  
[05:10] launched I would get people like telling me a 
little journey like hey this is me I'm trying  
[05:14] to do this I have struggle with that does your 
product cover XYZ and then based on the feedback  
[05:19] from uh in this case Dominico I get so much Gems 
so much uh object potential customer objections  
[05:26] that I use that to update the lending page and 
just as a quick example here Domino mentioned  
[05:30] about the fact that do you need the shipa B plate 
another product of mine to use the course and then  
[05:36] right after receiving this email I added a new 
section on the Ling page that's uh that's answer  
[05:42] the potential customer objection so if I had to 
summarize what making a good Ling page is I would  
[05:47] say it's two thing the first one is to making a 
promise that's almost too good to be true on the  
[05:53] headline and then the rest of the lending page is 
about answering potential objection and Shing that  
[05:58] yes you can actually deliver on the promise and I 
know that not everybody watching this video has an  
[06:04] audience um I didn't have an audience when I got 
started but there is something you can do all the  
[06:09] time to make sure you get good feedback so you 
build the right landing page in the conversation  
[06:13] that I have with two of my good friends Dan and 
Nico and then I would send them the lending page  
[06:19] a week or couple days before I launch and then you 
could see here my friend Dan replied hey this is  
[06:23] so [ __ ] um I'm laughing but back then it really 
hurts but this is very important because then I  
[06:30] know exactly that if my friend don't understand 
my Ling page or are not willing to then probably  
[06:37] it means that random people on the internet will 
never understand it so I told my friend that they  
[06:41] would rather be honest and hurt me than uh telling 
me good stuff only so take a few of your friends  
[06:47] or make friends on the internet and put them 
in a group like a mini group of you guys and  
[06:51] try to always ask them like give me Brut brutal 
honest feedback about why you wouldn't purchase  
[06:57] this product because I promise you this is 
exactly how you know how to build Ling page that
[07:02] [Music]
[07:11] converts finish yeah look at that this is freaking 
good man this is crazy what what happened I knew I  
[07:27] you know we talk about data fast I I checked the 
dashboard we made almost 5K in the past 24 hours  
[07:33] what and we're on a holiday how much 4.6k in the 
past 24 hours and look at that wow look at that  
[07:39] ship fast 1.5k uhhuh then two tiny startups 
$25 $9 $45 then C fast is still drinking this  
[07:47] is crazy this is crazy two almost 3K for C fast 
and that fast look at that I'm so happy cuz this  
[07:54] one I'm spending so much time working on that I 
this is where I invest most of my time and it's  
[08:03] making $150 per day I mean today I'm so proud of 
this one cuz this is really where all my time is  
[08:11] going and this is a little Port forio man this 
is just it's so it's so to see that this is a  
[08:16] little you know you have like a tinging Ting 
and and Ting this is just if you think about  
[08:21] it this is my little creation on the internet and 
we're on a holiday and we're still making money  
[08:27] while traveling only because I did the hard work 
before and now it's paying on the long term it's  
[08:33] like instant amount in crazy amount of work and 
then chill down and the results like no result  
[08:39] at all and now it's keep growing like whatever 
linear or exponential and we being results we  
[08:44] spend time with my family we work out we or 
a life man this is so freaking good this is  
[08:51] so it's a Sunday and we made $5,000 in 24 hours 
and I did not work in the last 24 hours this is  
[08:59] just crazy man and so and I want to high five 
you because you are 50% of everything that's
[09:05] happen how was the orang Kimi is very nice next to
[09:24] it Merry Christmas
[09:30] wow yeah the only people in Indonesia doing that 
are digital no who make this is really good yeah  
[09:41] the guy that did the morning much much lower true 
so we want to go after watching your videos he  
[09:48] found it really inspiring okay and that really 
made him want to you know his main job aside of  
[09:55] it and put more effort into his psychics he Dev 
yeah he's coding and he's also working in you  
[10:02] know Finance that's not fulfilling for yeah same 
bro it's really crazy we just met girlfriend of  
[10:09] our follower George yeah George like in the middle 
of the street like about to leave toer crazy the  
[10:17] power of Internet everything is on a computer and 
sometimes I don't know I was not expecting to me
[10:22] [Music]
[10:26] someone yeah back to the healthy routine 
and we're going to work eat healthy and  
[10:33] maybe serve wait what we launched Cod fast 
a month ago uhuh and students start to get  
[10:40] results and build the apps their first app I 
started coding just a week ago and shipped my  
[10:44] first product wow his bio says I learned how 
to cat in 7 days for me this is the Pinnacle  
[10:50] of Happiness that's George yeah we saw his 
girlfriend in the middle of Lisbon oh my god oh  
[10:59] so George message you yeah he actually messaged 
me hope you're enjoying your time in NBN and uh  
[11:05] it looks like he's doing some really cool 
stuff yep yep yep yep he has he has a big  
[11:10] following on Twitter as well oh it's super 
cool wow the word is small it's not how  
[11:15] sharing your thoughts on the internet you can 
eventually you end up connecting with the right
[11:19] [Music]
[11:23] people yeah I'm supposed to surf there later 
today I'm supposed to Surf with Jordan we met in  
[11:34] this town a couple days ago the c f student this 
crazy this is a crazy story he got the course and  
[11:40] then we moved in this little town here like 20,000 
inhabitants and it's like are you Mark yeah oh I'm  
[11:45] one of your students on C fast I was like what so 
it's been like maybe like 3 weeks since I launched  
[11:50] the course so people start to get results on they 
complete the course some make their websites so  
[11:55] I get I start to get feedback on the course and I 
received so many positive feedback back that makes  
[11:59] me so happy a that's nice they already made their 
website and projects some of them yeah already  
[12:07] yeah actually one of them I have to show it man 
I have to show it on the computer cuz it's it's  
[12:10] crazy so this is Adam Adam took the course C fast 
a couple days ago and he said that in 10 days he  
[12:18] was able to create some apps he was even able to 
get some visitors which was pretty uh it's really  
[12:23] impressive um this is one of the apps he built I 
believe this is a free marketing tool to promote  
[12:30] his main product I guess it's used for people to 
find discounts on Amazon and since I've received  
[12:36] so many positive reviews for cfast I have created 
a new page on C fast/ review whereas Scout Twitter  
[12:43] and whenever I see someone um posting something 
about Cod fast I will put the Tweet somewhere here  
[12:48] on this page and so I have this like a huge 
collections of reviews and testimonials and  
[12:54] uh things that people have built using Cod 
fast and then there is this uh this guy SL  
[12:59] who said that he's doing a thousand push-ups 
if he doesn't learn every single day and uh  
[13:04] it's been really fun to see his Twitter journey of 
sometimes he misses one coding day and you could  
[13:09] see like tweets of him just uh doing 100 push-ups 
here and there oh and also a quick SEO tip um you  
[13:15] can submit your site to Google search console and 
then Google will tell you uh which like how much  
[13:22] Impressions and clicks you get for your pages that 
are ranked on Google and I noticed one thing that  
[13:27] that Co fast review has this impression so people 
search for that but very low click and see this  
[13:33] is um this is very important because if they type 
code fast review they're interested in code fast  
[13:37] this is another reason that I decided to create 
this page put it under a totally different page  
[13:42] and also I made the entire uh H1 the the headline 
the main title for this page here uh name code  
[13:50] fast reviews and case studies to make sure that 
Google knows this is exactly what this page is  
[13:55] all about and so now if I search for code fast 
review uh Reddit will definitely appear first and  
[14:01] then uh hopefully yeah there we go this is uh the 
new page I created yesterday two days ago actually  
[14:06] and hopefully help people decide whether or not 
it's worth their money oh and one last thing I  
[14:12] hired someone um to a live instructor someone who 
knows how to code and is available on Discord and  
[14:18] answered uh my students questions so here we have 
for instance Doan who asks questions about the  
[14:25] course and MC his real name is Navin is answering 
questions like trying to debug them trying to help  
[14:31] them um fix their bugs understand what they're 
doing so that hopefully they get unlocked and  
[14:36] they can learn faster it was definitely not 
planned at all whatsoever when I made the  
[14:41] course but seeing people feedback on the Discord 
community at the beginning when I saw that some  
[14:46] of them would get stuck here or they would not 
understand a specific lesson which definitely  
[14:50] happens when you're learning how to code that's 
part of the process having a live instructor is  
[14:54] a game changer cuz then you have a real humans 
that can answer your questions and and DAV is  
[14:59] doing an incredible job and I can see that people 
love his work and love the support from him so I  
[15:04] guess that's a really good investment for the 
future of the course I just realized I have a  
[15:08] new business expense since I launched the course 
it's the platform that host videos for the entire  
[15:13] course and this is the most expensive bill I 
have in my entire Tech stack it's the service  
[15:20] MX so I can serve uh videos pretty fast and 
this is the bill for the past 30 days only and  
[15:29] compared to anything else I do I think this is the 
equivalent of the entire text tack everything else  
[15:34] like from server to um to hosting to domain 
name Etc just for videos which is fun and um  
[15:39] I mean definitely way more profitable than what 
it cost but I was not expecting to have a such a  
[15:46] high bill for uh videos but it's it's a really 
great platform they let my students stream the  
[15:51] course so if like you know you're in the subway 
and you don't have much data they will stream the  
[15:55] video in uh I don't know 720p and will increase 
the quality as your network gets better I don't  
[16:01] have to do anything which makes my life way 
easier and make my students life way easier
[16:06] [Music]
[16:06] [Applause] too we're about to cross 300K per month 
this month like last 30 days this is the highest  
[16:30] amount of money we've ever made I I I honestly I 
almost don't feel it's real anymore I'm I'm I kind  
[16:37] of feel like a mix of is it legit do we deserve 
this amount the numbers the numbers are freaking  
[16:44] insane I just finished this book from Barista to 
millionaire billionaire a billionaire I guess the  
[16:52] BB B2B the guy I think is like it's maybe even 
20 years in the making started as a bar that  
[17:00] to pay the bills and he started a little design 
agency and then just he stacked stuff on top of  
[17:04] each other until he build a holding company that 
buys and other companies and you know he changes  
[17:09] the CEO and he reorganized the companies and same 
like the guy I think struggled like nothing for 10  
[17:14] years and then suddenly one took off and another 
took off and then it's crazy cuz now he's only I  
[17:20] think 37 or something which is like he's super 
young but I think he started like when he was  
[17:23] 18 or something so it's like roughly 20 years 
in the making and same our life was not nothing  
[17:29] for like 6 years literally nothing you have to 
want something badly enough so you show up every  
[17:35] day and you don't quit until you get it I think 
what works is you have to leave you have to do  
[17:39] something I think there's no rules there's no like 
you you have to it's not in the mind it's like you  
[17:44] have to start something you go travel you go build 
that app you've been thinking for a while you call  
[17:49] that person you meant to call for a while like 
it's to actually do the thing and then things will  
[17:54] make sense afterward now things make sense what I 
was doing 6 years ago it makes sense now now but  
[17:59] it didn't make any sense back then but the only 
thing that makes sense is the things I could do  
[18:04] I wanted to I wanted to go travel try random jobs 
build random stuff just for the sake of building  
[18:09] something you can use that to try stuff that you 
know some point eventually will end up building  
[18:15] something that pays you $8,000 when you sleep 
it's just crazy we made it it's crazy [Music]  
[18:30] ah this will likely never happen again so I 
have to put it on the camera for the record  
[18:36] whoa I made over $300,000 in the past 30 days 
and this is absolutely mental three 3 years ago  
[18:46] I had a bitter feeling about entrepreneurship 
because I had failed previously some startups  
[18:53] so I had gotten a job I was I kind I gave up an 
entrepreneurship I had very low self-confidence  
[19:00] I had no following on Twitter Youtube or any other 
social media I literally had nothing and then for  
[19:05] some reason maybe the freedom of creating my 
own project I started again and I C it every  
[19:11] single day I did marketing every single day and 
I did not give up for the first 18 months when  
[19:17] nothing was happening and then somehow last year 
I ended up getting lucky with one of my project  
[19:23] and I again I got lucky last month with another 
one on my project so entrepreneurship is very  
[19:31] hard but I think if you create something valuable 
for some people if you manage to distribute it  
[19:38] and not quit this is the recipe to get lucky at 
some point yeah this clock is definitely not on  
[19:46] time but it's probably time for me to go to bed 
cuz tomorrow I'm going back to Paris spend time  
[19:51] Christmas with my family and uh I'll see you in 
the next video Until Then I hope you keep shipping
[20:02] please don't buy a domain name
