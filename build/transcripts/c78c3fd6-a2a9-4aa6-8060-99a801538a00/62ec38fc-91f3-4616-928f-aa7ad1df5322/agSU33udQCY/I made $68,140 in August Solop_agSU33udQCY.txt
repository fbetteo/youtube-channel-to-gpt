[00:00] drums keep pounding a rym to the brain
[00:03] something big happened in August because
[00:05] of that burn
[00:11] out no it's way too
[00:16] cliche August has been a crazy month so
[00:19] let's start with the
[00:22] finances so this is what my portfolio of
[00:25] tiny startup earned in the last 30 days
[00:28] the the entire business is up 2%
[00:30] compared to July and it was the biggest
[00:32] month for one of my software in the page
[00:34] I launched the software a year and a
[00:36] half ago and the revenue well the
[00:38] revenue is has been doing something like
[00:40] this it's a little bit uneven but it's
[00:44] roughly going up and it's ranging
[00:46] between $1,000 to $3,000 a month as you
[00:49] can see there's like this Spike that
[00:51] happened last week because I launched a
[00:54] new feature and I learned something that
[00:56] I ignored for so long if you had to
[00:58] guess which of those two tweets made the
[01:01] most
[01:01] [Music]
[01:04] money in both of them I promote Indie
[01:07] page and both of them got around 300
[01:10] likes and uh one this one is more
[01:12] detailed there's like a 40 seconds Lun
[01:15] video of me explaining the product I
[01:17] spent some time carefully crafting the
[01:19] copy and there's like this one where is
[01:22] just a screenshots and a link to my
[01:25] software and um this one made $100 in 24
[01:29] hours
[01:30] this one made $1,000 in 24
[01:32] hours here I'm promoting a new feature
[01:35] in the software where people can verify
[01:37] their revenue with lemon squeezy it's a
[01:40] nice to have feature it's cool but it's
[01:42] not necessary and here I'm saying that
[01:45] you get a nice backlink which helps you
[01:47] rank higher on Google I only track one
[01:50] data for all of my startups if I get 100
[01:53] visitors and it makes $100 then it's a
[01:55] $1 Revenue per visitor this vitamin gets
[01:59] 0.0 8 per visitor this painkiller gets
[02:04] $0.45 per visitor six time more Revenue
[02:08] it's much easier to sell a painkiller
[02:10] and the fun thing both are the same
[02:12] product I'm just talking about different
[02:14] features here so even vitamins products
[02:17] can be turned into a painkiller for
[02:19] instance a habit tracker is a nice thing
[02:21] to have it's cool to track your habit
[02:23] but it's not a painkiller now if the
[02:25] copy is framed around the fact that if
[02:27] you don't track your habits then you're
[02:29] going to not
[02:30] stick to your workout routine and you're
[02:32] not going to lose weight or you're not
[02:33] going to get in shape this becomes a
[02:35] painkiller so by finding the right
[02:38] feature or the right angle in your
[02:40] product that is an actual painkiller and
[02:43] remaking your website copy your Ling
[02:45] page copy around the problem it's
[02:47] solving then you can increase your
[02:49] commer rate with minimal effort and it
[02:51] took me one year and a half to realize
[02:53] that and uh and overall the revenue Bas
[02:56] line is always a little higher each
[02:58] month which is a good thing and um if
[03:01] you watch my previous video talking
[03:02] about how I find free tool free
[03:04] marketing tools to promote my business
[03:06] then you probably remember this little
[03:08] uh Indie page bot I created and um it
[03:12] it's 1.5 th000 followers now it keeps
[03:14] growing every day and it gets more likes
[03:16] more impression and I feel like this is
[03:18] one of the reason people are discovering
[03:20] the app more and more and uh something
[03:23] big happened in
[03:25] [Music]
[03:27] August I finally made $1 million on the
[03:30] internet after 7 years of grinding and
[03:32] failing 27 projects out of those 27
[03:36] projects 10 of them made money so it was
[03:38] pretty hard for me to try to know
[03:40] exactly how much I've earned since I
[03:42] started so I bought this little display
[03:44] here and I created an app that is
[03:46] fetching all the revenue from my 10
[03:48] stripe account and every hour it's
[03:51] updating the total revenue I earned
[03:52] since I started the journey and it's
[03:54] even crazier to think that 80% of that
[03:57] amount was made in the last 360 5 days
[04:00] I'll make an entire video of every
[04:02] failures I've been through and what I've
[04:04] learned from it there's stuff like
[04:07] this where like I would spend a year in
[04:09] my bedroom overthinking a startup but by
[04:12] not quitting I ended up winning and that
[04:14] makes me so so happy and proud of myself
[04:17] and um I don't I don't like to own stuff
[04:20] so I don't buy anything except except
[04:23] when I broke those those boards here but
[04:25] this month I've made a little exception
[04:28] my sister was visiting me in B so we
[04:31] went to nanida a little island nearby B
[04:34] which is smaller quieter calmer and
[04:37] super beautiful and we booked an amazing
[04:39] Villa for a $600 a night which is a
[04:42] ridiculous amount of money to spend in
[04:44] belly but it was totally worth it the
[04:46] Villa was wonderful we had a good time
[04:48] there we went snorkling we saw the Mena
[04:50] raay if you come to Bal this is an
[04:52] amazing experience to do and my good
[04:54] Twitter friends also visited us so it
[04:56] was absolutely wonderful okay and
[04:58] yesterday someone try to screw my
[05:00] website but I was prepared let me show
[05:02] you so I built this tool here it's
[05:04] called bu disput it aims at reducing
[05:06] charge back disputes on stripe and this
[05:09] is for instance my dashboard with all of
[05:11] my startups those are the rules I set up
[05:13] if I receive a payment with a suspicious
[05:15] email I would like to receive an email
[05:17] and if a card is reported stolen or lost
[05:19] I would like to refund the last payment
[05:21] and yesterday I received four emails and
[05:23] in my alerts I could see that um four
[05:26] credit cards were reported stolen and by
[05:28] dispute refunded all those payments so I
[05:30] went on strip to check what was going on
[05:32] and those are the refunded payments and
[05:34] I see I have weird customers with weird
[05:36] names either because they're like I
[05:38] don't know too simple or the the the
[05:40] place where the payment was made does
[05:42] not match so I took the emails and I
[05:44] checked in my database and um and
[05:46] nothing really matches the person is
[05:48] called Scots the email address is
[05:50] something that have nothing to do with
[05:51] Scots it's a do ID like IND Thea all
[05:54] those customers look suspicious and I'm
[05:56] so happy my little software was here to
[05:58] code that because because I could have
[06:00] ended up with four disputes and the fact
[06:02] that everything happened within a two
[06:04] hours window it made me think that
[06:06] someone was trying to screw my startups
[06:07] but I'm getting used to it now and I
[06:09] absolutely love this startup uh but the
[06:12] problem is not making lots of money I
[06:13] think it's making a couple hundred per
[06:16] month which is absolutely not crazy and
[06:18] the problem is that I don't really talk
[06:20] about it because it's like an insurance
[06:22] company I have to remind people that
[06:24] there is a danger with your STP account
[06:26] it could be banned from one day to
[06:27] another this actually happened to me and
[06:29] the thing is I need to spread fear to
[06:32] market the startup and I I just don't
[06:34] like that so I don't do it a lot but I'm
[06:36] just happy it's serving me and a few
[06:38] other customers and it's pretty helpful
[06:39] so far I'm recording this video on
[06:41] September 1st and today is a little
[06:44] special day one year ago I made this
[06:47] video all right so what do we have Here
[06:50] solo preneur 27 years old because of
[06:52] death burn out spend 3 days sending up
[06:55] gns record and E emails ended up in the
[06:57] span folder anyway
[07:00] well that wouldn't have happened if he
[07:02] had used the ship as boiler
[07:05] plates I launched this little startup a
[07:07] year ago and this has totally changed my
[07:11] life so um a little little celebration
[07:15] today happy birthday
[07:20] [Music]

[07:27] him in one of my previous videos

[07:43] [Music]
[07:50] man and all you have to do
[07:53] is
[07:55] this habit tracker for developers this
[07:59] is is generous and this is also a good
[08:01] example of what the solo prer Journey
[08:03] looks like a tiny idea in mind ship it
[08:06] fast show it to some people see what
[08:08] they think about it improve the product
[08:10] with their feedback make a little bit of
[08:11] money grow a little following on Twitter
[08:13] Youtube whatever and keep shipping so
[08:15] that the journey becomes easier and
[08:17] easier thank you Max it's a beautiful
[08:19] product and keep showing us how things
[08:21] should be done and if you're interested
[08:23] in getting desk Hub I'll add a link
[08:25] below I am not an affiliate just a fan
[08:28] all right and um final thing for this
[08:30] month I bought this thing a big big
[08:33] massive uh book I'm reading it biography
[08:37] I normally read on a Kindle uh but I
[08:39] feel good sometimes having a little
[08:41] paper in my hand especially at night
[08:42] when I'm about to go to bed I don't want
[08:44] to have any screen and it feels good to
[08:45] touch paper and it's good to read big
[08:48] entrepreneurs biography uh you can see
[08:51] Ambitions were like all up there and me
[08:53] with my tiny projects I'm I'm way down
[08:55] there but it makes me feel good somehow
[08:57] that there's a new form of
[08:58] Entrepreneurship where less ambition
[09:01] more freedom simple life little bit of
[09:04] surf a little bit of daily life with a
[09:05] wife prioritize my sleep Etc um I like
[09:08] that a lot as well and uh finally I was
[09:11] looking for a new format for this Vlog
[09:13] to try to show you everything I do in a
[09:15] month as a solo entrepreneur I tried to
[09:18] chat with AI this morning um I'm making
[09:21] a video for YouTube for a title you
[09:24] might consider something like are you
[09:26] here are you there or am I talking I'm
[09:29] here oh it's way too cliche and
[09:31] eventually showcase the how about these
[09:32] title options no I understand I was
[09:35] trying to know if CH GPT would come up
[09:37] with a good idea for those videos but um
[09:40] it's a little bit cliche and it was
[09:41] nothing really good but the conversation
[09:44] itself with the AI was amazing it felt
[09:46] very natural like I could literally see
[09:48] myself dating an AI talking about life
[09:51] questioning it was really pleasurable so
[09:54] for now I'm going to stick to a monthly
[09:55] recap that is more settle more calm I'm
[09:58] here at my office sharing you insight
[10:00] about everything that happens in my tiny
[10:02] businesses actually I wish I would share
[10:04] more but I have been building something
[10:06] almost secret for the past 3 month and I
[10:08] am launching next month so I'll have way
[10:10] more to share and I'll be here at my
[10:11] desk but somehow it's a little shame if
[10:13] I don't show you some parts of belly
[10:15] because it is absolutely beautiful so
