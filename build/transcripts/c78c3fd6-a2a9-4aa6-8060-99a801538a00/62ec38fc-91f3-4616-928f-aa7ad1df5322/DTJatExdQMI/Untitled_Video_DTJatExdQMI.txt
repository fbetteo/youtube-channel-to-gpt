[00:00] [Music]
[00:02] I hate marketing but um I need to grow
[00:04] my business so I built these Twitter
[00:07] Bots 9 days ago and uh it already has
[00:09] 700 followers and it grew the revenue by
[00:13] uh 56 56% so in this video we're going
[00:18] to talk about how I find this marketing
[00:20] tools idea so I can grow my business
[00:22] without having to ever do marketing I'm
[00:24] also going to show you how that Twitter
[00:26] bot thing work how I built it the text T
[00:28] and all the good stuff we're going to
[00:29] talk about the launch strategy and how I
[00:31] got the word out and finally we're going
[00:33] to talk about how that little thing is
[00:35] related to a real software business and
[00:36] how much revenue it has generated hey
[00:39] shut the
[00:47] up I built a software called Indie
[00:52] page it's a link in BIO tool for anyone
[00:55] who wants to Showcase their portfolio
[00:57] and it's mostly targeting entrepreneurs
[01:00] or anyone who is trying to make money on
[01:01] the internet users can connect their
[01:03] stripe account so that they can showcase
[01:05] their revenue and um this for instance
[01:07] is my Indie page those are the startups
[01:10] I built and the revenue is verified with
[01:12] stripe there are over 10,000 people
[01:15] registered on the app and uh the revenue
[01:17] has been doing well it's been making
[01:19] anywhere from $1,000 to $4,000 per month
[01:22] and um I believe they'll be much more
[01:23] solo entrepreneur so I want to grow that
[01:25] piece of software but I have a problem I
[01:28] hate marketing it feels like work so um
[01:31] I'm trying to find ways to do marketing
[01:33] without doing marketing it's basically
[01:35] building a tiny tool or a tiny feature
[01:37] that promotes your main application
[01:38] since I launched this leaderboard a
[01:41] couple months ago it's basically a web
[01:43] page that ranks entrepreneurs based on
[01:45] their revenue and he's been doing pretty
[01:47] well this is the spike of Revenue when I
[01:49] launched the leaderboard so um I'm just
[01:51] trying to reproduce the strategy and
[01:52] launch more free tools and I'm
[01:54] constantly looking for some small
[01:55] features that I can launch and
[01:57] potentially would go viral and I
[01:58] remember when I started the jour joury I
[02:00] was motivated by seeing other
[02:01] entrepreneurs making money and sharing
[02:03] it on Twitter and this is how I got this
[02:05] idea of creating a bot that's going to
[02:07] share entrepreneur revenue on Twitter in
[02:09] real time all right first let me show
[02:12] you how the product works so this is the
[02:14] Indie page Revenue bot and uh I think I
[02:17] just got reminded that I need to verify
[02:19] the page but Twitter makes it pretty
[02:20] tricky because I have to purchase a new
[02:22] phone number there are three actions
[02:24] that the Twitter bot is doing first it's
[02:27] going to tweet every time someone
[02:28] receives a payment it's also going to
[02:30] tag the maker of that startups and add a
[02:33] link to the startup the goal with this
[02:35] tweet is to give a little extra exposure
[02:37] to the project by adding a link to their
[02:39] website and hopefully the maker of the
[02:41] project could retweet that which would
[02:43] also give a little extra exposure for
[02:45] Indie page every Monday the revenue bot
[02:48] is going to Tweet the weekly leaderboard
[02:50] it's going to take all the payments data
[02:52] from last Monday to Sunday and he's
[02:54] going to aggregate all that and make a
[02:56] beautiful Le board just like this of
[02:59] course he's going to do the exact same
[03:00] thing at the end of the month and I
[03:02] cuted a little feature so that it pins
[03:04] that tweets at the top of the page and
[03:06] the goal here is again to give a little
[03:08] bit of extra exposure to some projects
[03:10] as well as gamifying the experience of
[03:12] working hard and trying to make money on
[03:14] the internet and uh just for the record
[03:16] I added this web page which has a
[03:19] history of all the tweets that have been
[03:20] made by the bot let's talk about the
[03:22] elephant in the room the text
[03:25] tack that's it that's all I'm using
[03:27] right joke aside here it is I'm using
[03:30] nextjs API or route whatever this is
[03:33] they call it I have three one for the
[03:35] daily tweets one for the weekly
[03:37] leaderboard and one for the monthly
[03:39] leaderboard and to trigger those API end
[03:41] points I'm using versal Chrome jobs
[03:43] feature which is super handy and super
[03:46] easy to use and since I am shipping fast
[03:48] I am not using typescript and I am using
[03:51] mongodb for the database I have a
[03:53] cluster that stores all the payments
[03:55] from stripe as well as the twiets and
[03:57] since there's a little bit of user
[03:58] interface for the content like the
[04:00] little board this is what I use Tailwind
[04:03] CSS and Daisy UI this is a simple UI
[04:06] component library that I use for all my
[04:08] project and I love it I never design any
[04:11] mockups or inigma I jump straight into
[04:13] the code and I keep iterating until it
[04:16] looks right should we talk about the
[04:18] code since the twitterbot needs to have
[04:21] access to some payments and strap
[04:22] accounts I added the code directly
[04:25] inside of the Indie page code the first
[04:27] thing I did was to create an account on
[04:29] EX developers and uh since I already had
[04:31] another account and Twitter will force
[04:34] you to pay $100 a month if you can
[04:36] create a second project then I recreated
[04:38] a new account and that's when things got
[04:41] complicated because your Twitter
[04:42] developer account is linked to your
[04:44] Twitter account and Twitter will not let
[04:47] you switch between developers accounts
[04:49] so I had to log out of my current
[04:51] Twitter account login to my Indie page
[04:54] accounts so that I can finally log to my
[04:56] Indie page Twitter developer account
[04:58] once I get once finally got my developer
[05:01] account set up I created a new project
[05:03] and I just went to keys and token and
[05:05] copy pasted all those uh secret and and
[05:08] bear tokens and and everything inside of
[05:10] the code so first I've created a library
[05:12] of helper functions for uh interacting
[05:14] with the Twitter API so I have my
[05:16] Twitter clients and I have a few
[05:18] function that will convert uh a big
[05:21] tweet into a thread for instance and
[05:23] then there are the three API endpoints
[05:25] so the first one is the daily tweets
[05:27] which is uh simply going to first check
[05:30] if the request is made by my uh Chrome
[05:33] job I only allow Verso to trigger the
[05:35] Chrome job so this is where my app is
[05:37] hosted and versal makes it super easy I
[05:40] just added this code inside of the
[05:42] versal DJs file it's going to trigger
[05:45] those three API end points the daily
[05:47] tweet every 3 hours the monthly theboard
[05:50] once a month and the weekly theboard
[05:52] once a week that's all I had to do to
[05:54] make this recurring all right now back
[05:55] to the Daily tweets so after this little
[05:57] checkup here it's going to start start
[05:59] executing the function first is going to
[06:02] find the most recent tweet the bot has
[06:04] been sharing he's going to find the user
[06:06] ID of the person who've been featured so
[06:08] that it does not retweet again the same
[06:11] person over and over because there are
[06:13] some guys who are making $1,000 a month
[06:15] and there are some guys who are making
[06:16] $100,000 a month and I want to make it
[06:19] fair for everyone so it's tweeting a
[06:20] little bit about everyone that's why
[06:22] here I'm fetching the most recent
[06:24] payment in stripe and I'm excluding the
[06:27] recent users who've been featured and
[06:29] and then he going to find information
[06:30] about that user the the name of the
[06:32] startup the name of the user the
[06:34] username and is going to create this
[06:36] line of text that will be the content of
[06:38] the Tweet to post to the Twitter API
[06:41] it's very simple with the client I just
[06:42] need to do Twitter client. v2. tweet
[06:44] with the text and if the Tweet went well
[06:47] I'm going to store that in the database
[06:48] so I'm not going to retweet that same
[06:50] person over and over and that's pretty
[06:52] much it for the daily tweet all right
[06:54] and now for the monthly and the weekly
[06:56] leaderboard those are two separate
[06:57] functions but the code is very similar
[06:59] it does the same uh background check to
[07:02] make sure that it's actually my server
[07:03] who's making the request then it's going
[07:05] to do this big aggregate function where
[07:07] it's going to fetch all the startups in
[07:09] the database who have strip verified
[07:10] payments it's going to calculate their
[07:12] revenue and is going to rank them based
[07:14] on who made the most money and uh I
[07:16] cannot really share what's inside of
[07:18] this big function because there's some
[07:19] like again some guys behind this camera
[07:21] who are trying to wreck my app and I
[07:23] don't want to make their life easier and
[07:25] then for each of the top 50 startups is
[07:28] going to create one line of text with
[07:30] the name of the person the name of the
[07:31] startups and how much revenue they made
[07:33] in the past couple days and since there
[07:36] are over 50 lines of text and Twitter
[07:38] only allow 280 characters per tweet I'm
[07:41] using this line of code to split this
[07:43] big chunk of text into a thread and just
[07:46] like before I'm using this function to
[07:48] post on Twitter save the Tweets in the
[07:50] database and if it's the monthly
[07:52] leaderboard I'm pinning it to the Indie
[07:54] page Revenue bot Twitter
[07:57] page let's talk about marketing and
[08:00] revenue but first I I have to start with
[08:02] this part I am lucky to have created an
[08:05] audience of over 100,000 people on
[08:07] Twitter so everything is a little easier
[08:09] for me and I am also a lazy person so
[08:12] all I did to promote this Twitter bot
[08:14] was to tweet one time and um it was
[08:16] enough to get around 300 followers on
[08:18] the tweet and at the moment it's getting
[08:20] around 10 to 20 extra followers per day
[08:23] so here is what I would do if I had to
[08:24] restart again with zero followers okay
[08:27] number one I would verify the Twitter
[08:29] page because it's about payments and
[08:31] building trust it's important to have
[08:32] the check mark badge and at the moment
[08:35] Twitter is pushing the content of
[08:36] verified accounts so it's also great to
[08:38] get more exposure second I would try to
[08:41] launch that bot everywhere hiker news
[08:44] Indie hicker Reddit Twitter product hunt
[08:47] I would give a shot for every single
[08:48] platform until hopefully one goes viral
[08:51] and I wrote tutorials about how to get
[08:53] the most out of those platforms in my
[08:55] blog if you want there must be a link
[08:57] somewhere below and finally I would
[08:59] partner with power users users of my
[09:02] software are already making money online
[09:04] but but who are not retired yet and I
[09:07] would just have a normal conversation
[09:08] with them show them the feature show
[09:10] them what are the benefits ask them if
[09:12] they have any feedback and hope that
[09:13] they will spread the word out all right
[09:16] and uh the final part will be about
[09:17] Revenue I guess all right so that's that
[09:19] is the the stripe account for this
[09:21] business here this is the revenue for
[09:24] this year in total there was a big spike
[09:27] around May because this is when I
[09:28] launched the the leaderboard this these
[09:31] things that people loved all right now I
[09:32] have zoomed in a little bit on the
[09:34] revenue these are the last N9 days of
[09:36] Revenue and this is the launch day and
[09:39] the the overall revenue is up by at
[09:42] least 50% and what I like to see here is
[09:44] there are less zero days so it means
[09:46] there is some ongoing flow some ongoing
[09:49] traffic new people discovering the app
[09:51] every day and I believe it's because
[09:53] well now Indie page is disable on
[09:56] Twitter and since it's tagging the
[09:58] makers of the startup that just made
[10:00] money it somehow brings a little bit of
[10:03] awareness so more people get to discover
[10:04] Indie page and it's slowly increasing
[10:06] the revenue but when this video comes
[10:08] out you can check my Indie page uh you
[10:10] will see my real time revenue for Indie
[10:12] page and see whether there was a spike
[10:14] or it was a total flop but I have
[10:15] noticed something never ship never know
[10:18] all right I hope you just ship it
[10:21] [Music]
[10:22] [Applause]
