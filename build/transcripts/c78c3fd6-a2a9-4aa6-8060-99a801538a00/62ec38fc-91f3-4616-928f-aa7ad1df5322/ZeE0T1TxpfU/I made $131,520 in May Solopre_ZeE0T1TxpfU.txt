[00:03] [Music]
[00:17] all right we are
[00:18] rolling I just bought uh ship fast.com
[00:22] for $5,000 us plus another $1,000 for
[00:26] the marketplace fee this is crazy
[00:29] because exactly a year ago I was making
[00:32] around $1,000 per month with my little
[00:34] software and I was counting every
[00:36] Pennies from uh domain names but also
[00:39] everything like food and accommodations
[00:42] and I was trying to buy the cheapest for
[00:44] absolutely everything and ending up
[00:46] paying uh probably what was my annual
[00:49] salary in 2022 for one domain name is
[00:52] just insane um and I was able to get
[00:55] here um because I've been grinding for
[00:57] the past 3 years until luck found me and
[00:59] one of the things that kept me motivated
[01:01] to grind was to compete with friends
[01:03] that's why I added a new competition
[01:05] feature to one of my software called
[01:07] Indie page let me show
[01:10] [Music]
[01:17] you you want to be on the
[01:23] Vlog hello
[01:27] rooster about a year ago I created a
[01:29] little software called Indie page it's
[01:31] like a link tree for entrepreneurs
[01:34] basically they creat their profile they
[01:36] add their startups and they have a
[01:37] beautiful uh public page and I wanted to
[01:39] bring some gamification elements so that
[01:42] uh people who need some motivation to
[01:44] get started or to grind and find
[01:46] motivation uh would be easier for them
[01:49] and I added a leaderboard it's basically
[01:52] uh taking every startups and every hours
[01:54] it's fetching the revenue from stripe
[01:57] and it's ranking those startups based on
[01:59] their actual Revenue in the last 30 days
[02:01] so every month people can compete to
[02:03] rank on that leaderboard uh this is
[02:05] exactly the strategy I use to grind for
[02:08] the past three years or so I was
[02:10] competing against my two friends Dan and
[02:12] Nico and you know we would share like
[02:14] who has the most like on the tweets and
[02:15] who has the most revenue on his startups
[02:18] and uh and this is really helpful for
[02:20] [Music]
[02:24] motivation hello
[02:31] [Music]
[02:33] something fcy
[02:36] boy such a beautiful s
[02:40] it okay one of the biggest update of the
[02:43] month is that I built my 24th uh digital
[02:47] product it's called Ino it's a little
[02:49] tool to collect feedback from customers
[02:52] it was born out of frustration CU
[02:54] Alternatives were either super complex
[02:56] or too expensive and I made an entire
[02:58] video about that if you want to check
[02:59] it's somewhere around here how I get the
[03:01] ID How I build it fast how I launched it
[03:04] on product hunt and got around 10,000
[03:06] visitors and I actually got the product
[03:09] of the Day badge I was really really
[03:10] happy with that one of the questions I
[03:12] get the most on my YouTube is why do I
[03:14] build so many products instead of
[03:16] focusing on one in my experience there's
[03:18] a lot of luck involved in
[03:20] entrepreneurship um one of my product
[03:22] ship fast made I think close to $600,000
[03:25] in the last8 months or so and I had zero
[03:29] expectation I really build it uh for
[03:31] myself as a codebase so I can ship
[03:33] faster and it was totally random and
[03:35] it's very hard to predict what's going
[03:37] to happen so the more product I ship the
[03:39] more bets I make and at the same time I
[03:41] learn so much from every product I make
[03:44] from um how to build faster how to make
[03:47] less bugs how to be better at
[03:49] copyrighting I'm learning about
[03:50] marketing like it's just a pure like
[03:52] Learning Journey that I absolutely love
[03:54] for instance a couple days ago I found
[03:56] this guy on Twitter his name is janjo he
[03:58] built a lit Chrome plugin in I think an
[04:01] afternoon or something that helps
[04:03] developers testing credit card with
[04:05] stripe instead of having to type 42 42
[04:07] 42 uh in the stripe checkout it prefills
[04:09] all that and you save a couple of
[04:11] seconds every time you test the credit
[04:13] cards and he sold that plugin for
[04:16] 4.2 uh per customer which I think is
[04:18] really smart and I think in a week he
[04:20] made around
[04:22] ,500 us just selling this little Chrome
[04:25] plugin and I think he after that he even
[04:27] sold a startup for another $1,000 so the
[04:29] guy went went from just about the span
[04:31] of a week it went from just having a
[04:33] random ID to building a product getting
[04:35] customers and getting Acquired and
[04:37] that's amazing CU that's so there's so
[04:38] many things you learn in this little
[04:40] process and that's one of the reason I'm
[04:42] very uh addicted and I love uh shipping
[04:45] so many
[04:47] [Music]
[04:54] product are you afraid to what you know
[04:58] is real like any
[05:02] [Music]
[05:09] other and we are live in B where the
[05:11] waves are crushing the show this month
[05:13] my family-in-law my Korean family know
[05:16] visited Us in belly I've been married to
[05:17] the lovely Korean girl behind this
[05:19] camera for seven years and they often
[05:22] visit us in belly or we go in Korea to
[05:23] see them I'm from France and so we mix a
[05:26] culture and is very very um C what what
[05:30] is mixing culture is very I don't even
[05:32] know what I was about to say with cultur
[05:35] different person she's from Korea I'm
[05:37] from France and being with a person from
[05:39] the other side of the globe has been so
[05:41] interesting and I learned a lot from it
[05:44] for instance in France if you say
[05:45] bonjour or hello with the not the
[05:47] perfect French accent people will say no
[05:50] bour and in Korea if you say like Hello
[05:54] in Korean with a very broken accent
[05:57] they'll be like oh congratulations
[06:00] they'll be very cheerful so uh it's very
[06:02] fun to mix cultures also I've been
[06:04] learning a lot living here in B I see
[06:06] how people live very different lifestyle
[06:08] very different mindset uh it's so just
[06:10] so interesting to see uh how different
[06:13] we can be and we can learn a lot from
[06:14] each other that's so beautiful
[06:17] [Music]
[06:32] I know what it is uh let me open
[06:38] it
[06:42] t it's here
[06:44] it's uh wa if you don't know what it is
[06:47] um it's coming from product hunt product
[06:49] Hunt is a platform for uh developers and
[06:52] designers uh VC startups whoever wants
[06:55] to launch product on the Internet uh
[06:57] product Hunt is the place to launch the
[06:59] startup it's a place where you can get
[07:00] um thousands and thousands of visitors
[07:03] for free actually when you watch this
[07:05] video there might be a video on my
[07:06] YouTube channel where I go over my
[07:08] strategy to launch startups and get
[07:10] traffic for free if you want to check it
[07:12] out and once a year they do this little
[07:14] ceremony where they select the best
[07:16] product for developers the best product
[07:18] for designers the best crypto app and
[07:20] they also select one maker of the year I
[07:23] don't know exactly how they select the
[07:24] maker of the year um in my case probably
[07:28] because I launched over 10 products on
[07:30] the platform uh the in 2023 and they
[07:33] gave me the maker of the Year award
[07:36] 2023 I'm so happy uh because when I
[07:39] studied the journey three years ago I
[07:41] would uh I had models I still have
[07:44] models like mentors people I absolutely
[07:46] admire like Peter LEL Danny bosma Timo
[07:49] maker those guys would get this maker of
[07:51] the Year award and I saw them as like
[07:54] some kind of rock stars and I would
[07:55] absolutely admire them and it would help
[07:57] me grind and show up every day and it's
[08:00] so unreal that it's here like I get the
[08:02] same a word as they gots it's I don't
[08:04] know it just feels really unreal and
[08:07] it's so beautiful but you can be
[08:09] literally no one at the moment like
[08:11] nothing that's working for you and
[08:13] showing up and and you know doing the
[08:15] thing I don't know you can you can get
[08:17] one of this like it tookes two years two
[08:19] and a half years and yeah thank you if
[08:22] you have been around for a while
[08:23] following the journey it really means a
[08:25] lot thank you
[08:28] [Music]
[08:35] you're ready to do
[08:36] it that's the place I surf every day cuz
[08:40] I I tend to overthink and surfing really
[08:43] helped me clear my
[08:46] [Music]
[08:52] mind okay uh what is your workout
[08:57] routine uh I don't have a routine I
[09:00] don't have much goals with workout I
[09:02] just want to be fit I don't care being
[09:03] bulky I don't care being a gym boy I
[09:06] don't care having big muscles I just
[09:07] want to be feet and lean and stretchy so
[09:11] I can do a bunch of sports so my routine
[09:13] is a bit different from the one you
[09:15] probably see on YouTube I don't go gym I
[09:17] don't take any supplements I don't lift
[09:19] any weight never lifted weight in my
[09:21] life I don't like lifting weight I feel
[09:23] like this is how I hurt myself and it
[09:25] forces me to go to the gym instead I am
[09:28] working here in my house every single
[09:30] day 365 days a year uh 20 minutes
[09:34] workouts uh 20 to 30 minutes body weight
[09:37] only uh mostly cardio and calisthenic uh
[09:40] I follow this YouTuber I love her name
[09:42] is Caroline gavon she's a beast um I do
[09:45] hold her all the workout she does that
[09:47] are not um requiring any weights uh and
[09:52] it's very short so it doesn't require
[09:53] much thinking it's not like a big hurdle
[09:55] I have to do so it's easy to get
[09:57] motivated but once I am in the work out
[09:59] I really push myself like crazy uh
[10:02] sometimes I even get dizzy I don't know
[10:03] if that's good probably not but I really
[10:05] push as hard as I can I don't think
[10:08] about anything else there's no phone
[10:09] distracting me uh I try to make more
[10:12] reps than
[10:13] her uh and I try to never have any break
[10:16] and if I feel like it's too easy
[10:17] whatever I'll do some ABS in between
[10:19] rests uh I would really get the most out
[10:21] of it like really pushing crazy for 30
[10:23] minutes um and then I eat healthy foods
[10:26] so mostly vegetables uh nuts cereals
[10:30] fish eggs a little bit of meat um almost
[10:33] no sugar obviously no alcohol no
[10:36] cigarettes uh very no pizza pasta or
[10:39] almost never and uh yeah but no
[10:42] supplements but just healthy
[10:44] food is it boring no that's
[10:49] true also one more thing uh to be fully
[10:52] transparent I live in belly so I surf
[10:54] almost every day and when I surf I don't
[10:56] work out so obviously the results I get
[10:59] is results of Fitness like homeworkout
[11:01] plus surf uh but I've tried this like
[11:04] body weight Fitness only routine uh
[11:06] every time when I go on travels and my
[11:09] body stays roughly the same except that
[11:11] that my shoulders shrink a little bit
[11:14] cuz surf is a lot of paddling so it's a
[11:16] good shoulder workout but the overall
[11:18] body weight the overall Body Fitness is
[11:20] pretty much the same whether I do only
[11:22] workout or surf workouts mix
[11:29] [Music]
[11:37] let's talk about Revenue this month I
[11:40] made a little over
[11:42] $130,000 as a solo entrepreneur from
[11:44] nine sources of income and seven of them
[11:47] are digital product it's also the
[11:49] biggest month for Indie page my link in
[11:50] bio for entrepreneurs I'm very excited
[11:52] and this is where uh lots of my focus is
[11:54] going on at the moment in terms of money
[11:56] spent I spent around $5,000 for stripe
[11:59] fees so somewhere like 4% of all the
[12:02] payments um what is it $3,000 for ads
[12:05] around $ 1.5 th000 for Affiliates a
[12:09] little bit less than $500 for the Tex
[12:11] stack and
[12:12] $25,000 to Outsource a few tasks so
[12:15] that's around $112,000 of expenses which
[12:18] leaves me with
[12:21] $118,000 of profit I started sharing my
[12:24] Revenue publicly on Twitter when I
[12:26] started the journey three years ago and
[12:27] I do this for two reasons the first one
[12:29] is I want to remember where everything
[12:31] started and I want to remember that it
[12:33] took time and the second reason is
[12:35] because it's very easy
[12:37] with and the second reason is because
[12:39] it's very easy to say pretty much
[12:41] anything with a little bit of
[12:43] Storytelling so I'm not saying that the
[12:44] person with bigger numbers is more right
[12:46] than other people but I'm saying that
[12:48] it's so easy for anyone to say anything
[12:50] on the internet so I just want to add a
[12:52] little bit of proof here but for sure
[12:53] I'm still a total rookie in
[12:55] entrepreneurship all right and to be
[12:57] totally transparent with the Rue and
[12:59] this is the dashboard for one of my
[13:01] product called ship Fest uh this is the
[13:03] daily revenue and this is the revenue
[13:06] for this
[13:08] [Music]
[13:20] month I don't want
[13:24] [Music]
[13:30] I know you know
[13:32] already okay this has been a crazy month
[13:36] uh it's been a crazy year actually from
[13:40] opening the business here in Asia to
[13:43] changing my tax residency as well as you
[13:45] here launching three softwares customer
[13:48] support marketing Twitter YouTube um I
[13:51] still do almost everything myself cuz
[13:54] the the goal has always been to stay
[13:57] solo so I don't have any meeting I don't
[13:59] have any deadlines nobody's waiting for
[14:02] me uh but it's at the same time it's so
[14:05] uh terring physically tiring I really
[14:07] struggle to disconnect from work I'm
[14:09] looking for boundaries like where I can
[14:11] close my computer and be off work
[14:14] completely but this never really happens
[14:16] I wake up sometimes at 3:00 a.m. and my
[14:19] brain is fully focused on work for
[14:21] sometimes 1 hour or 2 hours uh yeah
[14:23] sometimes I just wish this would go away
[14:25] I hired a therapist this month to help
[14:27] me with bounding if I if there if there
[14:30] is such a thing in entrepreneurship but
[14:32] uh I kind of guess this is you never
[14:34] expect anything and then you have to
[14:36] deal with all the new issues new
[14:38] problems coming up um I also feel guilty
[14:41] saying this because I wanted I wanted
[14:43] this so badly and now it's happening uh
[14:46] there's a part of me that wish he would
[14:47] slow down a little bit uh but anyway it
[14:49] still just a wonderful Journey um the
[14:51] YouTube channel crossed 50,000
[14:54] subscribers this month and it was about
[14:57] a th subscriber earlier this year
[14:59] so this is just this is just absolutely
[15:01] crazy thank you so much for following
[15:03] the journey it really means a lot um I
[15:05] read all the comments uh except the bad
[15:08] ones but I I read all the love messages
[15:11] um and if you're watching this probably
[15:13] you are not one of those bad comments so
[15:15] thank you for staying around all right
[15:17] until the next video I hope you just
[15:20] ship it cheers
