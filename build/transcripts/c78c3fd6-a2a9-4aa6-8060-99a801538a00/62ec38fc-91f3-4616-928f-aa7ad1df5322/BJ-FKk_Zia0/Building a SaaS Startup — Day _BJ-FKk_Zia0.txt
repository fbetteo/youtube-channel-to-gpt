[00:09] are we live maybe we are I think we are
[00:11] live boom welcome back hello
[00:14] everyone this is day six of uh building
[00:17] a little software startup here on
[00:20] Twitter twitch and YouTube it is uh
[00:22] something like almost 11: a.m. here in B
[00:25] let me know where you guys are probably
[00:27] all around the world we are going to
[00:30] finish the product today uh we already
[00:32] made good progress last week we already
[00:33] have something that's almost functional
[00:35] uh it is functional and we need just
[00:37] need to publish a few things and then
[00:38] we're going to write landing page copy
[00:40] um and ship that thing hopefully by the
[00:42] end of the week uh please let me know if
[00:45] the quality of the audio is okay and
[00:47] same for the screen I am going to
[00:50] actually I'm going to share my real
[00:51] screen this is it um if you're from
[00:53] Twitter go on to my YouTube channel I
[00:56] think the quality of the broadcast is
[00:58] much better there and you can tag Elon
[01:00] Musk in the Tweet post and tell him that
[01:02] the the broadcast quality on Twitter is
[01:04] quite
[01:05]  um where we got here okay so if you
[01:10] have no clue who I am I am markl I have
[01:12] been building little um startups um in
[01:15] public on Twitter for the past two years
[01:17] uh meaning that I create little apps I
[01:19] share everything that I do that I learn
[01:21] that I earn and um I join a little
[01:24] community of people doing the same thing
[01:27] uh those are all the products that I've
[01:28] made uh about 21 side projects um 10 of
[01:32] them became profitable startups and I
[01:34] ended up selling three of them uh the
[01:36] rest are making money as of February
[01:38] this year my salary last month was 50
[01:42] $57,000 and the most common thing I get
[01:45] in my customer support is can I uh get
[01:47] an invoice or can I edit the invoice and
[01:50] if you are doing onetime payment with
[01:52] stripe you might do the hustle uh either
[01:54] you have to do invoices manually or you
[01:57] have to give 0.4% of your uh Revenue to
[02:00] strip just to generate a PDF so my goal
[02:03] is to solve that with Zenvo doio this is
[02:06] the actual product that I've been
[02:07] building last uh week here uh live uh
[02:12] it's functional there are a few things
[02:14] that we need to finish but basically
[02:15] this is the ID uh once you sign up you
[02:17] get a link a unique link you connect all
[02:20] your STP account that you want customers
[02:21] to retrieve or generate invoices for and
[02:24] then when you get a request from a
[02:25] customer that says can I get an invoice
[02:27] they input their email they'll get a
[02:29] unique link
[02:30] that uh they will be able to uh check
[02:33] and then they'll see all their invoices
[02:35] with your business businesses if you
[02:37] have multiple and then they can view the
[02:39] invoice they can edit their customer
[02:40] information uh sometimes Europeans need
[02:42] to add their V details or sometimes they
[02:44] just mess up their name and they want to
[02:46] add their actual name and they click
[02:49] download they get the invoice they're
[02:51] happy and the stri business owner
[02:53] doesn't have to do
[02:54] this um this is pretty much it um it's a
[02:57] very tiny little startup it's called C
[02:59] invoice uh it should be live by the end
[03:02] of the week and today we are going to
[03:03] make sure that the information of the
[03:06] customers don't leak out so for now um
[03:09] when you get the link you can input an
[03:10] email and you can see any invoices made
[03:13] under that uh emails person so which is
[03:17] not really safe uh if you're running
[03:19] some adult websites or whatever this is
[03:22] that can connect with stripe uh you
[03:24] might not want people to input any
[03:26] customers emails and retrieve their
[03:27] invoices so uh what I'm going to be
[03:30] doing today I'm going to generate a
[03:31] token so if you input your customer
[03:33] email it's going to say like oh we found
[03:35] two invoices for your accounts um click
[03:38] confirm to receive an email and download
[03:40] your invoices so this basically going to
[03:42] be two steps uh so I I'm going to have
[03:44] to set up some email token thing and
[03:47] email sending stuff and then customer
[03:49] will get a private link to their sent to
[03:52] their emails where they can actually see
[03:54] this information right here after
[03:55] clicking the link on the email so it's
[03:58] private and it's going to be the the
[03:59] same formula here click the invoice see
[04:02] it and download
[04:04] it um one little quick second I'm making
[04:07] sure that everything is running so that
[04:09] I'm not speaking to my computer and
[04:11] nothing is actually happening okay we
[04:13] have the link here uh yep it seems like
[04:16] it's live I need to upload a little
[04:20] thumbnail to be relevant it's not made
[04:23] for kids and we can push that and if you
[04:26] are on Twitter let me share the link
[04:28] somewhere so you have a better quality
[04:31] for the
[04:33] broadcast uh
[04:35] YouTube quality is
[04:43] better
[04:44] bingo all right the link is sent we have
[04:47] everything running on on YouTube I'm
[04:49] going to check in the chat making sure
[04:50] that everything is
[04:52] running okay we are
[04:55] live all right um let's go
[05:06] all right so we have um for now we have
[05:10] one API route when customer input their
[05:12] email it return invoices we need to
[05:14] split this
[05:16] in probably two or three routes I
[05:19] think yeah something like that um what
[05:23] are we going to do we are going to
[05:28] have C getting voice I think
[05:35] here um think we're going to rename yeah
[05:37] we're going to make we're going to call
[05:39] this
[05:40] invoices we're going to set
[05:46] uh this will be called get
[05:50] invoices we are going to have another
[05:55] oops where are we yep we're going to
[05:57] have another route which is search
[06:03] invoices and we okay we'll have a round
[06:07] tojs
[06:08] here we will also have a so the customer
[06:13] knows they are X YZ invoices under their
[06:17] name and they say confirm and he's going
[06:18] to send an email so search invoice
[06:22] search
[06:25] invoices maybe let say send
[06:34] Ines it doesn't make sense to call that
[06:36] all
[06:39] search and get or maybe we're going to
[06:42] call that
[06:43] download
[06:45] okay here as well we have a round.
[06:50] JS we are going to copy what we had
[06:52] previously in the download part and I'm
[06:54] going to remove a bunch of
[06:58] code
[07:01] so here we will need the ID so that that
[07:04] will not change we're going to search
[07:07] for strap
[07:09] accounts okay I think we're going to
[07:10] perform the search query as well we're
[07:13] just not going
[07:17] to yeah we're not going to S okay I
[07:20] think we're going to do the same
[07:26] thing think here we don't need to do all
[07:28] that I think probably going to
[07:30] say invoice
[07:34] portal you're going to say by default
[07:36] there are no invoices and we're going to
[07:38] iterate over all the SHP accounts from
[07:39] the user to check if there is any uh
[07:44] invoice somewhere so we
[07:47] probably SCP account we get the access
[07:50] token we
[07:53] retrieve the customers for each
[07:56] customers we retrieve the invoices
[08:04] you're going to get this and you're
[08:05] going to say
[08:09] oops we going to say uh
[08:17] increase yep thank you plus filter
[08:21] length Okay we increase
[08:25] that and we are going to do the same
[08:27] here we retriev the checkout session
[08:30] we want only those where the payment
[08:31] intent status was succeeded and here we
[08:35] are not going to do that we are going
[08:37] instead to
[08:41] say yes
[08:45] sir we don't need to add any information
[08:47] here we don't need to sort
[08:50] anything and we are going to send um
[08:54] going to say something like
[08:57] found invo is total and we are going to
[09:01] send this
[09:04] back um we're also going to duplicate
[09:06] this page
[09:10] here so we have
[09:16] okay okay I think we're going to do this
[09:19] way go here create a e like invoices and
[09:25] here we're going to do like
[09:28] P
[09:30] and here we're just going to have a
[09:34] page.js which will be a copy of that
[09:42] thing and in
[09:46] here let me
[09:48] think lfg day six baby yep day six
[09:54] boyi yo
[09:56] Jack are you still I think last time if
[09:59] you're if you're still around Jack last
[10:00] time you say you were in Dubai or
[10:02] something are you still around
[10:20] there let me
[10:24] um voice and then we're going to get the
[10:26] token
[10:28] okay
[10:30] so here
[10:33] um all right we can actually index that
[10:38] page now because yeah it doesn't matter
[10:41] if we
[10:48] invoice um what we don't want to do
[10:51] though we
[10:53] don't res set the user
[10:57] ID what's what's up yo Ben Ben
[11:02] Woodward what's going
[11:05] on we're fixing this
[11:08] um the invoice invoice page ID I think
[11:11] this is the part that will change for
[11:13] this instead we are going to have
[11:15] invoice
[11:17] page yeah that's the part we're going to
[11:19] call it
[11:21] invoice Page
[11:24] search and this is going to be a think
[11:28] I'm going to copy that components and
[11:30] Estates but we are going to have a
[11:32] simpler components customer detail
[11:36] ref yeah there will be no need for
[11:39] that handle submit we need to change
[11:42] this part to uh we said
[11:46] invoices.
[11:48] getet and user ID blah blah blah
[11:53] okay go oh yeah here it's going to be
[11:58] invoice says I think we're going to say
[12:01] invoices
[12:04] total instead and we're going to start
[12:07] with
[12:11] zero
[12:14] okay so here we want to say
[12:18] invoices rest.
[12:25] invoices this
[12:27] one and we are going to give it invoices
[12:30] total
[12:32] okay for invoices this is good download
[12:36] the invoice and the for the formatter
[12:39] the country code name edit invoice all
[12:41] that I don't think we need
[12:42] it yep can remove all that it's going to
[12:45] be a simple
[12:47] page and
[12:49] here okay that's the part that we can
[12:52] also remove CU we're not going to
[12:53] display invoices
[12:56] anymore we're going to say uh for now
[12:59] I'm just going to show invoice
[13:05] total invoices
[13:08] [Music]
[13:10] S I don't think we need the model oh
[13:13] maybe we'll need a model at some
[13:17] point say screenshot
[13:21] yeah I think you will need a
[13:24] model just to say do you want to confirm
[13:26] your email and receive the unique link
[13:31] probably this section here is useless
[13:36] which is going to have a basic
[13:42] text
[13:45] text set invoice to edit and yeah that's
[13:48] the part we can remove customer detail
[13:50] screenshotting We Don't
[13:52] Care customer details ref invoice ref we
[13:56] don't
[13:57] care we don't care there and we probably
[14:01] don't care about that as well let's see
[14:04] is loading invoices total invoices to
[14:06] edits that's the part we need to change
[14:08] I think we don't need any of
[14:10] those oh maybe we still need a show
[14:13] confirmation model
[14:16] probably we need a
[14:20] show just show model CU it will be
[14:23] anyway on the
[14:27] one okay
[14:29] we're going to pass this uh that is the
[14:32] input okay going say show
[14:38] model key doesn't matter here set show
[14:45] model
[14:49] okay it could be best that well all
[14:52] right let's give this a try this page
[14:55] should update normally let's see making
[14:58] sure P invoice page content oh no yeah I
[15:02] need to update I need to import instead
[15:04] of this
[15:06] one I need to import
[15:09] invoice oops actually I don't need to
[15:12] change all that I just need to change
[15:14] the the last part voice P
[15:18] Page
[15:22] search just
[15:25] refresh show true and false okay where
[15:28] did I message
[15:30] up show show model oh yeah should be
[15:34] false here by
[15:37] default all right so zero invoices found
[15:41] okay and now if I type my name we have
[15:44] an air of course if you work in the
[15:47] first time there's something
[15:49] wrong that's
[15:51] fine think you didn't just find the you
[15:54] don't know which I think I miss called
[15:55] the rout
[15:57] probably API I
[16:00] invoices yeah there is no get there is a
[16:02] search
[16:05] instead 45
[16:08] heyy
[16:11] um invoices
[16:14] search do we have here yeah of course
[16:16] there's no content in
[16:19] there what did I do though oh yeah
[16:24] okay I need to have the right code yeah
[16:27] let's try it again
[16:31] undefined found 12 invoices okay I think
[16:34] we
[16:35] just need to update the UI on the
[16:40] front it says found 12
[16:43] invoices we're going to say uh
[16:46] search here rest rest. invoices total
[16:51] okay maybe I made a mistake in the
[16:55] writing invoices total wait let's
[17:02] see do we get back from that little
[17:06] thing here payload preview response okay
[17:08] invoices total okay so that is
[17:13] good
[17:16] um oh yeah yeah of
[17:19] course right that should work
[17:22] now here update show me 12 okay we have
[17:25] 12 invoices
[17:27] fil
[17:30] okay so if we don't have any invoice
[17:31] founds I think it's going to show a
[17:34] little error message here okay that is
[17:37] good now we need to show the model that
[17:41] says we found 12 invoice for under this
[17:44] email click the link to receive your
[17:48] private email okay let's build a UI
[17:54] then now maybe we need to think how this
[17:57] be handled uh maybe we need need to
[17:58] create the models database models first
[18:00] we'll need to have
[18:02] tokens
[18:04] um where are the models again yep they
[18:08] here so I think here we're going to say
[18:11] um
[18:13] invoice invoices invoice
[18:19] token and we are going to copy a model
[18:23] whatever this
[18:24] is going to delete a bunch of stuff
[18:28] we are going to rename all
[18:32] that let say invoice
[18:39] token invoice token so what is happening
[18:43] here when customers type in their email
[18:48] we don't want to show their invoice
[18:49] right away otherwise it would be public
[18:51] and everybody would be able to see
[18:52] invoices instead it's going to show
[18:54] something like we found 12 invoices
[18:56] under your email click here to receive a
[19:00] private link to edit and download your
[19:03] invoices and what's going to be
[19:05] happening in the back end we are going
[19:06] to create a unique token with whatever
[19:09] 36
[19:11] characters that will be sent to the
[19:16] person's
[19:20] email in the
[19:22] link and we're going to be using that
[19:24] token to retrieve the invoices for the
[19:26] person so that token will rest storing
[19:28] the email of the
[19:38] person um no user ID I think he needs to
[19:42] store the the user yeah the actually we
[19:46] need to store the user ID yeah of
[19:48] course it is required it is also
[19:54] required both are required uh this will
[19:57] be the user ID of of the person who owns
[19:59] the STP account this it will be the
[20:01] email of the person that we need to send
[20:03] these to and we'll need to create a
[20:06] token um how are tokens created I don't
[20:23] know what do we have here we have
[20:25] something that creates a hash and random
[20:33] string uh it is required we're going to
[20:36] say
[20:37] dream
[20:39] true and we're also going to say mean
[20:42] length I think this is called mean links
[20:45] I'm not
[20:50] sure going to say
[20:53] 24 is it how it's called I don't know I
[20:56] I
[20:57] forget makes sense okay probably just to
[21:00] be sure we don't create shitty
[21:02] tokens um
[21:07] okay then back
[21:09] here uh we will need to create an API
[21:12] routes and this is where the magic will
[21:15] happen this search here done no problem
[21:19] the send API route
[21:23] so this is where we need so we will need
[21:27] we we'll generate a to on the backand we
[21:29] will will'll need we'll need the part
[21:33] we'll also need the email from the
[21:49] person should we have another check up
[21:54] here no we don't care we're just going
[21:57] to say that either no trp account
[21:59] bye-bye and here can remove all
[22:03] that and we will need first to uh create
[22:07] a unique
[22:10] token of 36
[22:14] characters why 36 I have no
[22:17] idea
[22:21] um then we'll need to what else do we
[22:24] need to do we need to
[22:26] send
[22:34] email to the user with a token and a
[22:37] link to reset uh no not to reset and a
[22:41] link to
[22:44] download
[22:48] invoices that's all we need to do right
[22:50] we need to create a
[22:52] token create the
[22:55] token send it to the user update the UI
[22:59] users goes on the link click the link
[23:01] with the token the front end will take
[23:03] the token and send it to the back end
[23:06] and if it exists in a database it's
[23:07] going to retrieve all invoices for that
[23:09] specific
[23:11] email does that sound yeah sounds
[23:14] good I think this is what we can try
[23:18] first um here we just going to console
[23:21] log
[23:26] s
[23:34] to
[23:37] email
[23:39] okay here we are going to create the
[23:44] token give me some magic oh I
[23:47] think okay math two string sub string 25
[23:51] I have no idea what this is maybe we
[23:53] need to use a function that we're going
[23:54] to be
[23:56] reusing um
[23:59] for R what's the name of it I think we
[24:02] has something
[24:04] here string I think it's
[24:09] called time script time script fixes
[24:12] this tring generates oh no I think it's
[24:15] in another
[24:17] Library
[24:20] import random string yeah there we go so
[24:23] token random screen of 36 perfect um
[24:27] save token in the
[24:45] database we going to say cons oh okay we
[24:48] need to import probably that model
[24:50] import
[24:56] uh
[25:03] send email yep that's for sure and we
[25:05] also need to import the
[25:08] invoice toen you found it there we go
[25:16] okay
[25:22] okay new invoice token um token email
[25:27] and you user
[25:29] ID I think do we have it yeah we have
[25:32] user ID we have the token that was
[25:33] created we have the email we save the
[25:35] token and here give me some magic oh
[25:39] yeah the link will
[25:43] be okay maybe we need to do some magic
[25:48] here process. environment.
[25:53] node go development and Local Host
[26:06] or no https
[26:09] here or we're going to go
[26:13] here
[26:18] htps config we need to import the config
[26:21] file as
[26:22] [Music]
[26:26] well
[26:34] okay and we are going to
[26:40] doig do domain
[26:43] name and now it's going to be i n token
[26:47] equal
[26:50] token we can I think we can also save to
[26:52] say email equal email we have the token
[26:56] we have the email okay we have the link
[26:57] L now we're going to send it send email
[27:01] thank you copot to
[27:04] your oh maybe

[30:48] blink is this going to work is this it
[30:51] does
[30:54] yeah
[30:56] okay
[30:58] all right and because I love
[31:00] procrastinating I need to do
[31:04] that group
[31:06] over translate
[31:14] X let need do
[31:22] this
[31:24] okay I had to
[31:36] okay we want something inline

[32:08] 300 procreation top
[32:13] level
[32:16] okay
[32:19] promo this is
[32:22] good all right so now we need to make
[32:25] the list invo
[32:32] where is it um
[32:37] page actually if I click here oh yeah
[32:40] that works could use vs code features
[32:43] more
[32:48] often zero invoices
[32:55] found let search
[33:05] no okay whatever I'm going to say is
[33:08] loing false
[33:11] true in here we're going to say
[33:17] Ines
[33:24] um I like you to know we don't need that
[33:27] we need to just
[33:30] say we show the
[33:32] model yeah here we just say Okay C say s
[33:38] model if they are if resent invoice
[33:51] total Superior to zero we do that and we
[33:55] will also set model okay and then in the
[34:00] invoice is found we don't care about
[34:02] that
[34:05] invoice and we probably can remove this
[34:12] section we might want to do
[34:17] also yeah we might want to do something
[34:19] like that Flex Flex
[34:21] raw Flex
[34:23] call
[34:25] Gap
[34:33] eight probably
[34:40] whatever here we want to do margin top
[34:46] AO oops maybe I messed up
[34:49] somewhere
[34:55] um we have one two three
[34:59] sections let
[35:08] go oh yeah okay because we have the
[35:10] margin oh yeah we have the padding
[35:11] buttom
[35:15] okay so normally these link should look
[35:18] like the same
[35:22] here and yeah we have this okay powered
[35:25] by using voice okay
[35:28] all right not too
[35:29] bad so now back to
[35:41] it okay here we will have uh if we have
[35:45] invoices we'll show the model
[35:48] correct show me something yes we have
[35:50] the model
[35:55] OKAY in we can make something much
[35:58] smaller
[36:07] though
[36:09] [Music]
[36:14] Excel it look like
[36:16] now can do in the
[36:19] force this to be
[36:23] true there's a luk
[36:25] okay
[36:29] okay we found the
[36:30] [Music]
[36:38] invoice actually I think I should reuse
[36:40] one of the model components cuz
[36:46] yeah
[36:50] position that
[36:52] show model
[36:55] okay
[37:04] all
[37:08] right okay so here is the model and it's
[37:12] going to
[37:20] say I think here we're going to say
[37:22] invoices total
[37:25] pound Z invoices spond which makes sense
[37:28] for
[37:29] now and we are going to
[37:34] have here something that says

[40:01] yep
[40:03] send my
[40:09] link a
[40:13] button button
[40:16] primary button
[40:20] block okay we need to make sure that

[41:57] and then this function
[42:00] here um we are going to call the other
[42:02] API routes
[42:04] so the search part uh handle submit
[42:09] we're going to do
[42:11] handle um send
[42:16] link
[42:19] oops yep and where is the link it's here
[42:23] on
[42:25] click to handle send
[42:33] link oh maybe I can do something like
[42:37] constant has
[42:39] sent and
[42:42] when this should be false when this
[42:45] was this will be sent we're going to say
[42:48] something
[42:55] like this will not
[42:58] exist we're going to
[43:02] say I think we're going to REM yeah
[43:05] we're going to set email through
[43:07] that and we are going to say true and
[43:10] we're going to show a little message
[43:12] that
[43:13] says your link was
[43:16] sent and so here we are going calling
[43:19] this API
[43:21] route
[43:23] invoices
[43:24] send Using the same
[43:27] [Music]
[43:29] parameters set is loading
[43:35] Okay Go
[43:40] Okay form and just
[43:46] for we're going to disable the link I
[43:48] think yeah we're going to disable it
[43:54] um oh maybe we we show a little toast
[43:57] message that says
[44:00] uh link sent Bingo and the button will
[44:04] be
[44:19] disabled where where do we have send the
[44:21] link
[44:25] um come on finish that for me no you
[44:28] don't
[44:29] want do by hand then um okay loading and
[44:33] then when this is
[44:36] done oh I think I messed up yeah this
[44:39] should be this
[44:40] one we isable when it
[44:43] sent we send it to the
[44:46] customer we remove the email from the
[44:49] part no maybe we don't need to do that
[44:52] okay send email set send
[44:57] through and we are going to show
[44:59] something like uh under the button a
[45:03] little text here says asent and
[45:20] P check your
[45:24] SP
[45:27] uh check
[45:29] here inbox and
[45:35] spam just in case
[45:39] uh and we are going to make this a
[45:41] little text SM and text success all
[45:47] right let's give it a the first try see
[45:51] how much uh how many bugs we're going to
[45:54] get and doing this surfing coding my
[45:58] first product in Costa Rica so similar
[45:59] to life in belly just 10 hours behind
[46:02] that's fun man so it's something like
[46:04] 9:00 p.m. your time yeah oh man Costa
[46:05] Rica I really want to go
[46:07] there never been to South America I
[46:09] heard it's really good really good surf
[46:12] as
[46:19] well more new
[46:22] gmail.com let's see what we have all
[46:26] right found the invoices sent my link
[46:29] and here we're going to pull the console
[46:30] see if we got
[46:31] errors all
[46:35] right of
[46:38] course um cannot resolve send email from
[46:42] my library of
[46:46] emails send
[46:52] part I think it's called
[46:54] Mel
[46:56] yeah yeah of
[47:04] course
[47:07] yes uh so probably at this point we have
[47:12] created the token
[47:13] somehow this is not IND the page we're
[47:16] going to check this is invoice and if we
[47:19] reload we might see a new collection in
[47:20] the database we do verification token no
[47:23] we
[47:24] don't oh of course cuz the function was
[47:27] not even executed
[47:29] okay what do we have internal server
[47:34] okay invoice token validation
[47:38] failed um as token is no longer than the
[47:43] maximum All loed 48 is this 48 character
[47:47] this is not 48 character is it it looks
[47:51] like it
[47:54] is
[47:58] um what do we call
[48:01] there random
[48:09] string so I guess this was not created
[48:12] was
[48:13] it oh we've create okay the collection
[48:16] has been created but there is no data in
[48:17] it okay the math I think helper how is
[48:22] it called random string
[48:31] okay I think
[48:37] uh can do
[48:49] length how much how many characters 72
[48:52] oh okay it create
[48:54] doubles okay token maybe we're going to
[48:57] do maybe we're just going to create 32
[48:59] and say it should be
[49:06] 64
[49:08] invoice toen and here we going to say 72
[49:15] in I think I guess that will be just for
[49:17] the
[49:20] record okay that should work
[49:24] now
[49:29] we lost a CSS
[49:31] file no I think we just lost the font
[49:35] actually we get here send token to Mar
[49:39] clue okay so I should have gotten an
[49:41] email somewhere in my
[49:44] mailbox let's check it
[49:48] out let's also check out that we have
[49:51] the token here so the user ID is
[49:54] supposed to be the same as the one
[49:57] that's right
[49:58] there it is the token is that long
[50:02] string and the email is that one okay oh
[50:06] should
[50:07] we should we expire so
[50:10] stoken maybe we should create an expiry
[50:12] date for the
[50:16] tokens I think we need to create the
[50:18] expired date
[50:21] um
[50:24] before
[50:29] no do we
[50:31] care yeah we don't want to yeah okay
[50:33] okay okay yeah now that I'm here I'm
[50:36] going to finish
[50:42] it where was it um in the send part we
[50:46] want to say this
[50:50] expires actually I can do this expires
[50:54] here
[50:58] invoice token we're going to say
[51:06] expires all right let's see if I got the
[51:08] email here invoice download link here is
[51:12] your download link
[51:14] Bingo here is your invoice download
[51:17] link and this is it we have the token
[51:20] there we have the person's
[51:24] email
[51:29] here is your
[51:40] invoice uh and probably going to say in
[51:43] the send part we're going to say
[51:50] um
[51:52] edit and download
[51:57] load your
[52:00] invoices with this
[52:09] link I think that should be good and now
[52:12] we just need to create the final page
[52:14] the the front end
[52:16] part and and that
[52:19] would that would that should work
[52:24] out
[52:26] but we've lost the font entirely no it's
[52:29] back
[52:38] okay let's try it
[52:41] again link sent please check your
[52:43] invoice and spam folder and let's go
[52:46] back to it Mark as invoice edit and
[52:50] download your inboxes with this link
[52:53] okay maybe we can create a little HTML
[52:56] friendly HTML part if jpt is up to
[53:24] it
[53:26] with this link
[53:30] okay
[53:32] um okay maybe we can copy past that
[53:36] thing and
[53:39] here uh oh yeah we should see we should
[53:41] have an expiry date
[53:43] normally uh no we don't have one oh
[53:46] maybe because I didn't refresh the I did
[53:49] refresh the server didn't I no I didn't
[53:52] I
[53:52] did strange
[54:01] um invoice tokens
[54:05] expires maybe I missed up something
[54:15] here let's try again let's burn some
[54:18] email
[54:22] credits yeah okay he not ready
[54:26] are
[54:32] you
[54:34] no I think I messed up
[54:37] somewhere is it still on
[54:40] for 3,000 it
[54:46] is oh okay yeah it's the wrong page
[54:49] here okay need to Big
[54:54] that all right yeah there we go
[55:03] again all right give me the
[55:05] link clue gmail.com
[55:21] okay right Zen voice download link okay
[55:24] that looks a bit better let's double
[55:26] check that we have the
[55:28] expire thing okay it
[55:30] expires in 24 hours that's the case
[55:33] right UTC time time is it UTC time I
[55:37] think it is 3 something okay we have a
[55:40] 24 hours download link that's available
[55:43] so going back to this um we have that
[55:48] thing oh probably we'll need to use the
[55:51] latest link
[55:53] okay and now we need to to edit this
[55:55] page so this page
[55:59] is uh
[56:01] invoice here we don't
[56:04] need uh we want to probably yeah we want
[56:06] to exclude all those
[56:09] pages that can remain the same we don't
[56:11] need static params because this will be
[56:18] given yeah we don't of course we don't
[56:20] need any of
[56:22] that Bingo and here we don't need
[56:27] that edit your
[56:31] invoices need and
[56:33] download your
[56:38] invoices let's see how that
[56:45] works and Bo boom invoice page
[56:49] [Music]
[56:53] content all right in this part we don't
[56:56] need to have the form anymore because we
[56:58] already
[57:01] know we already know
[57:04] which which customer it is so we don't
[57:07] need any email we probably don't need
[57:11] the loading part as
[57:13] well we need the invoices because we're
[57:15] going to fill that in we need the
[57:17] customer details and we need okay here
[57:21] we it
[57:23] okay
[57:25] andle submit I think endle maybe here
[57:28] we're going to get endle get invoices or
[57:32] maybe just get
[57:36] invoices oh yeah we got okay we still
[57:39] need to have a loading stuff
[57:44] okay set is loading and here we're going
[57:47] to say
[57:50] no and we are going to go back to this
[57:53] route and say uh uh maybe downloading
[57:57] get invoices customers
[58:01] invoices and we're going say
[58:05] download user
[58:13] ID okay that's the part where we have to
[58:15] get the token so we also need where is a
[58:18] user
[58:19] [Music]
[58:21] ID here we have the user ID
[58:27] idea and here we have the
[58:34] token and we are going to
[58:38] need um how is it called use param I
[58:41] think use path name
[58:47] no next is how to get to get very
[58:53] params
[58:55] see I have been there
[59:06] already all
[59:12] right so we can download
[59:15] that we are going to also oh so we don't
[59:18] need to have a use effect okay that is
[59:20] the good
[59:22] part search pars and here we're going to
[59:24] say just user ID and
[59:32] token this is good token
[59:36] and user
[59:40] ID we can remove
[59:43] that uh we have two tokens no we don't
[59:46] yes we do no we
[59:53] don't
[60:01] okay we'll still need a
[60:02] little use effect somewhere that
[60:06] says uh get invoice
[60:21] call he's already inin yep
[60:25] get noices
[60:27] and there we go and here what do we do
[60:30] so we set loading part okay we go to
[60:33] invoice download we pass in this thing
[60:36] and we pass in as well the
[60:43] token we will blur this but we don't
[60:46] care cuz there is no actual
[60:50] input rest uh
[60:53] invoices
[60:58] all right we're going to keep the
[61:00] download invoice the formatting part we
[61:03] probably yeah we don't need the form
[61:05] anymore we can remove it and I guess the
[61:08] rest should remain the
[61:10] same let's give it a try um we oh I
[61:14] think we didn't code that part yeah
[61:16] here uh we don't get the email but we
[61:18] get a token
[61:20] instead if there is no token we say
[61:24] sorry missing user ID or
[61:33] token first we need to uh retrieve the
[61:37] token okay
[61:44] and actually we don't need to pass the
[61:47] email here we don't need we don't even
[61:49] need to pass the user ID we just need
[61:50] the
[61:53] token
[61:57] um invoice page
[61:59] content here we just need
[62:03] that thing
[62:06] here token part and we are going
[62:12] to uh in the download
[62:15] page retrieve the
[62:20] token from dat Bas
[62:23] check return error
[62:26] if not found or
[62:34] expired
[62:42] expired and here we're going to do user
[62:45] ID okay okay got it and we just need to
[62:52] import invoice
[63:03] uh nope invoice token
[63:12] Mis if there's no invoice token
[63:16] or
[63:18] okay respond to not one or expired and
[63:22] we say bye-bye
[63:28] user ready invoice token
[63:31] okay we receive okay and we okay right I
[63:35] think let's try let's see if that works
[63:37] that would be beautiful if it worked in
[63:38] the first
[63:40] time we are going to give it a
[63:42] try can
[63:49] that did we
[63:53] call
[63:55] maybe we can just show a little
[64:00] spinner invoice page
[64:15] content all right I think that's the
[64:17] part where we can say if is
[64:20] loading and we're going to show some
[64:23] kind of like a loading spinner
[64:26] whatever or if invoice do lengths
[64:31] Superior to zero we're going to show
[64:33] that or we're going to show a
[64:37] little error message that says
[64:44] uh
[64:48] noices
[64:50] found
[64:53] loading
[64:59] do we have some
[65:08] errors is it
[65:11] loading if it's loading we're going to
[65:13] show
[65:14] loading if not we're going to or if
[65:17] there are invoices we're going to show
[65:18] the invoices or we're going to say no
[65:20] invoices um do we call the function
[65:23] somewhere
[65:29] oh maybe we
[65:33] should get
[65:35] invoices is this function being called
[65:40] Somewhere user ID and token let's see if
[65:43] it's I think we don't we never call we
[65:45] never actually call
[65:53] that
[65:58] no okay we don't have any user ID the
[66:01] reason
[66:02] is we have here oh oh okay it's because
[66:05] I put it in the email okay do we need
[66:08] the user ID no we don't need
[66:11] that because we're only sending the
[66:13] token so we don't care for the user ID
[66:16] and we actually will never get it
[66:20] uh yeah we we don't care we just need
[66:22] the token
[66:25] and we can remove that so now loading
[66:29] okay and bingo we have the
[66:32] invoices
[66:36] beautiful all right this is beautiful
[66:38] that's working
[66:44] um I think we're are going to take this
[66:48] little part
[66:50] here and
[66:53] say
[67:07] we might want to do
[67:09] Flex
[67:17] call gap
[67:22] eight all right but his invoice this
[67:30] good okay this is
[67:33] beautiful um let's try to expire the
[67:35] token making sure that we don't send
[67:37] invoices after 24
[67:40] hours and we going
[67:45] to uh expires we're going to say let's
[67:48] say it expires already the 13 so today a
[67:51] few hours ago let's see if you reload
[67:54] the page you can not phone or expired
[68:09] beautiful all
[68:11] right M
[68:21] edit invoices
[68:26] okay we are okay we'll probably need to
[68:28] show a little spinner somewhere a bit
[68:31] friendly
[68:32] spinner just just to procrastinate a bit
[68:36] more
[68:43] um it's not in there it's
[68:51] probably why do you use DZ I components
[68:54] have you tried other component Library
[68:55] like sh cidan Shen I haven't tried any
[68:59] of those um I think some of them are
[69:02] really trendy and beautiful I am just a
[69:05] uh never changed my Tex T person so I I
[69:09] started using Daisy two years ago I love
[69:12] it it's pretty
[69:13] simple if there I think they have 30
[69:16] teams or something like that the buttons
[69:18] are friendly uh big so I stick to
[69:22] it
[69:32] where is it there it
[69:35] um yes okay invoice
[69:39] page contents search yeah
[69:42] spinner all right we want to show this
[69:44] little spinner
[69:45] here which we're going to useing the
[69:48] invoice page contents and is
[69:52] loading
[70:14] SE okay it's loading the invoices they
[70:16] are all here um and in the
[70:21] case here
[70:27] here no
[70:31] invoices
[70:34] found and here we're going to do uh
[70:37] think we're going to need a
[70:40] link get new link get
[70:45] new CL Link
[70:49] Link
[70:52] primary and H rev
[70:55] Beal oh we have no
[70:59] clue okay I
[71:03] think in the email sending part we will
[71:07] probably need to send back something um
[71:12] instead of sending the email
[71:14] maybe we send the user
[71:18] idea so
[71:22] that
[71:26] if we have the user ID on this
[71:32] part we can
[71:35] then Circle back in case something goes
[71:38] wrong no invoice is found here we can do
[71:41] something
[71:42] like um slash e
[71:46] slash user
[71:50] idea and
[71:52] so
[71:57] it's loading no invoice is found get new
[72:01] link and normally yep no this isn't
[72:05] working oh yeah because okay the link
[72:07] was okay yeah yeah think I would have to
[72:11] have let's try again
[72:15] um with a new link we are going to say
[72:20] markl you found the invoices oh yeah I
[72:23] think I've
[72:28] already oh I found a little bug here
[72:31] invoice Page
[72:34] search
[72:37] and has
[72:43] said Cal
[72:49] model just going to say if we search
[72:52] again
[72:55] if the page remained open we're not
[72:57] going to clear it out okay here we found
[72:59] 12
[73:17] invoices let's do it
[73:22] again
[73:28] almost
[73:32] there all right FES send my
[73:36] link
[73:38] okay so now back at
[73:41] it here is invoice download
[73:44] link okay and we have the token and the
[73:48] user ID
[73:50] normally okay this is good and now we
[73:54] have a link that should
[73:57] normally bring us back to the right
[74:00] page is
[74:03] it isn't oh maybe I click on the wrong
[74:06] okay
[74:07] yeah okay this is good
[74:15] um
[74:18] so invoice is found get new
[74:21] link and we need to have this here
[74:41] okay okay we have all the invoices we
[74:44] can view them we can edit the field till
[74:47] I guess Mark Loop
[74:52] download
[74:56] okay okay so that should be
[74:59] working um do we have a real account
[75:01] here connected no I don't think
[75:04] so
[75:17] see verify
[75:21] request okay yeah I have just one test
[75:24] account so that's why we don't have much
[75:26] detail
[75:27] details
[75:29] um I think that should be
[75:33] enough we're going to come in that part
[75:36] and push it
[75:37] live uh say add secure
[75:45] token
[75:52] and
[76:00] invoice we have this oh let's check the
[76:02] invoice format inv invoice page contents
[76:06] uh I thinkable yeah if there's
[76:11] a there's a memo here we're going to be
[76:14] displaying
[76:22] it
[76:25] we have something in the footer
[76:44] yeah is it enough
[76:52] um
[77:07] I think I need to turn off my screen for
[77:10] a
[77:10] minute you pull o
[77:16] oh your last YouTube video do you do you
[77:19] prioritize validating the problem
[77:21] customer demand cler to Dan kov
[77:24] marketing first ship his
[77:26] software um I think it it really depends
[77:28] what kind of person you are for me all
[77:31] marketing task are pretty boring um the
[77:34] guys who are actually crushing it
[77:35] usually they know what they're doing
[77:37] they've done customer research they know
[77:40] there is a potential problem out there
[77:42] and you know they'll build something
[77:44] that they somehow they know already if
[77:47] there is a need and it could be
[77:48] validated for me it's I I ship something
[77:52] um
[77:54] i' I've been shipping lots of app that
[77:55] were useless but I I this is the only
[77:58] way I find my motivation to work is to
[78:01] actually get to the code and ship
[78:03] something and so I kind of solve the
[78:05] marketing is my marketing issue by
[78:08] making apps real quick so I can validate
[78:10] and test them really fast because if I
[78:12] spend a year on an app then I'll go a
[78:14] big burnout which happened in the past
[78:17] instead I make I don't know an real
[78:19] quick so make website to you didn't it
[78:25] yeah so I yeah zero valid I mean now
[78:28] it's so there are two parts when I got
[78:30] started I had no audience I had no clue
[78:33] what I was doing and so I would ship
[78:35] anything now um my Twitter account grew
[78:39] a little bit uh I got feedback from uh
[78:41] people and I also got feedback from my
[78:43] apps and so I get to see similar things
[78:47] people request the same thing the
[78:48] invoice part that I'm doing right now is
[78:51] because I know I would use the product
[78:53] and I also know that some of my friends
[78:55] who are running strip businesses have
[78:56] the same issue so thanks to what I've
[78:59] done in the past now I know I have some
[79:01] information that validate in some way
[79:05] the problem I'm not 100% sure people are
[79:07] willing to pay for it uh maybe you know
[79:09] the app will make some uh mistakes maybe
[79:11] this is a wrong pricing but at least I
[79:14] know there is a little need
[79:17] somewhere a lot lot of SE revalidation I
[79:21] know someone who will do a lot of AC
[79:23] validation before even touching the code
[79:25] so yeah man I think I think this is a
[79:28] yeah you have like marketers who know
[79:30] where the needs needs are and they are
[79:33] smart and they just push an up where
[79:34] people have needs you have people like
[79:36] me who just want to build stuff and you
[79:39] build something and hopefully sometimes
[79:41] you have an app that hits the market and
[79:43] you have somewhere in between like
[79:45] probably like Danny PMA I think is a
[79:46] good example he's a very talented with
[79:49] SEO and this is what he did with hedgeh
[79:52] Pro where
[79:54] it's a mix of him wanting to build some
[79:56] AI cool AI tools uh trendy and stuff and
[79:59] at the same times EV valid EV validated
[80:01] the need with SEO and when you combine
[80:03] both you have the best of both world I
[80:07] guess wait you put all your component in
[80:09] a single
[80:11] directory uh
[80:13] yes yeah I don't have a specific way of
[80:16] organizing things I have a big directory
[80:18] for my API files and
[80:21] this components directory here on the
[80:24] left I try to name them uh
[80:27] with stuff that makes sense like if if I
[80:31] type B I would find all the
[80:34] buttons um sometimes I have model like
[80:37] specific models for some stuff so I have
[80:39] Model D model blah blah blah um
[80:44] yeah hello Mr
[80:49] wab all right give me one second I need
[80:52] to to uh reveal some real stripe API
[80:55] keys so I cannot show my
[80:58] screen uh let me go to stripe and see if
[81:02] I can get real API key for real
[81:09] testing but I do
[81:12] that I have
[81:17] to let me
[81:21] think
[81:38] all right let's
[81:42] see oh are we connected
[81:46] still okay my internet is not down
[81:48] that's a good
[81:50] thing stripe he's pretty slow
[82:02] though what is going
[82:13] on uh maybe I don't actually I don't
[82:15] need to go to stke maybe I can try
[82:17] something else
[82:21] um oh
[82:27] yeah IND the Page by disputes okay this
[82:29] one
[82:43] um The Voice name
[82:48] URL maybe we should do something yeah
[82:52] maybe we should
[83:00] support primary color support emails I
[83:03] think we might want to show the business
[83:05] address all right yeah I'm going to have
[83:07] to close that
[83:09] and right I'm back
[83:12] from Little stripe API
[83:21] keys the amount of
[83:24] stress by like having to hide my stripe
[83:27] API key to avoid having to go to all my
[83:30] uh my current little project and having
[83:33] to rechange
[83:36] everything okay um so uh is it landing
[83:40] page day today I think we could do it um
[83:43] I am almost done with the
[83:46] product so yes that will be a landing
[83:48] page I'll I probably have a little lunch
[83:50] before and we're going to move on you
[83:52] ship mobile version of your product will
[83:55] Zeno be responsive I guess and work well
[83:58] on mobile yes always responsive uh I
[84:01] don't know what that looks like but if
[84:02] you go to my analytics I think half of
[84:06] my users in sh fast they are probably
[84:10] using
[84:11] Chrome device browser OS how do we see
[84:15] that
[84:17] actually I don't even
[84:20] know I thought PL would show you if
[84:23] people are using OS maybe Mac Windows
[84:27] iOS okay this is not perfect we can do
[84:30] all the
[84:32] time um iOS yeah you see that's
[84:37] crazy 36 36% are using iOS this is
[84:44] crazy mac you have a clear dominance
[84:48] from Apple right
[84:50] here Android yeah so we have more than
[84:53] half of users coming
[84:56] from yeah more than half of users coming
[84:58] from mobile so yeah I
[85:02] do
[85:08] do and yeah you can see here uh this is
[85:11] not the most beautiful page but this is
[85:14] what Zen voice looks like on mobile
[85:16] device making sure you guys can stream
[85:18] my scam okay right so I think here there
[85:22] is a little part that I would like
[85:25] to show
[85:27] is do we get the
[85:30] business should we get should we show
[85:32] the business sometimes I think we might
[85:35] we might want to get the business uh the
[85:38] stripe business
[85:41] address because I had actually yesterday
[85:44] I had a customer who wanted to
[85:46] show my business address on the invoice
[85:50] and maybe that should be another option
[85:52] somewhere
[85:56] um maybe
[85:59] here yeah maybe we
[86:02] need let's go back to
[86:08] try wait maybe I can just actually do
[86:16] that
[86:18] um so we if we create an API key where
[86:24] so let's see in the I think it's the
[86:27] connect connect connect connect where is
[86:31] it
[86:35] API TR create check out nope where did I
[86:38] put that
[86:39] yeah
[86:41] um create a file link this is not what
[86:44] we want accounts
[86:46] settings I think I'm going to log and
[86:49] see what we get actually maybe I just
[86:52] retrieve accounts
[86:53] strip retrieve
[86:55] [Music]
[86:56] account stripe accounts St retrieve okay
[86:59] maybe we'll see what we get
[87:02] here um stripe account API let's
[87:08] see the account object that's the one I
[87:10] was looking for the business type uh we
[87:13] probably don't care about that
[87:14] capabilities company information about
[87:16] the company or the business you have a
[87:20] that's probably what we want
[87:24] CU here so when the person connects a
[87:26] strap account to Zen disputes we're
[87:29] going to say very tiny information um
[87:32] here we save the primary color just to
[87:35] display um a stylish invoice the support
[87:38] email under the business profile which I
[87:41] guess is what we saw here oh no it's a
[87:44] different
[87:46] thing yeah that's the that's the part
[87:49] that's what we get um
[87:54] support email support phone we might
[87:56] want to have a little category here that
[87:58] says
[88:01] um probably the business address
[88:05] somewhere you get that estimated worker
[88:07] accounts that's a lot of information
[88:09] here the customer facing business name
[88:11] this is what we get here I
[88:13] guess
[88:16] yeah uh MMC no we don't care about any
[88:19] of that product descriptions support
[88:21] address wiing address oring support
[88:23] issues
[88:26] too maybe we need to display the support
[88:29] address if the business owner decide to
[88:30] make this public then we need to show it
[88:33] on the
[88:35] invoices should
[88:38] we maybe we can check stripe
[88:42] invoice
[88:46] formats and going back to typical strap
[88:49] invoice right that's not what we want um
[88:54] probably this is
[88:58] it yeah we have the business uh okay
[89:02] this is the address I think this is what
[89:04] we're going to try to copy here the
[89:07] 4B let's see the let's see what it says
[89:10] on the official documentation I
[89:13] think will be Merchant company name and
[89:16] Merchant company address s invo enter
[89:20] support address under the public
[89:22] business
[89:23] information also default to bus you can
[89:26] also default to your business address as
[89:28] listed in your the business address and
[89:31] the public business information okay we
[89:32] have to to check which we want to show
[89:40] um let me go back to it public business
[89:42] information let's
[89:50] see
[90:05] is plausible much better than regular
[90:07] versal analytics I do not know um I
[90:11] haven't tried the versal
[90:13] analytics I know it's not cheap at all
[90:16] and I was a long-term plausible user so
[90:19] I get the I think I think I get a cheap
[90:22] plan than what they currently offer so
[90:24] I'm trying to stay with that how do you
[90:26] decide between making more web apps
[90:28] versus building on top of AI models
[90:31] seems like levels for instance building
[90:33] only AI related product by the
[90:35] way um making more web I think I I was
[90:39] so last year I was making web AI apps
[90:42] like I try to do these make lending um
[90:45] actually I did this and even sold this
[90:47] startup for
[90:50] $35,000 but something felt wrong a
[90:52] little bit I think when you do this game
[90:56] of playing with AI tools you need to you
[90:58] know be on the lookout for what are the
[91:00] latest AI stuff that are being released
[91:03] and you need to be somehow first or in
[91:05] the first to ship something I was
[91:07] definitely not the first to do this kind
[91:09] of thing and it was really hard to grow
[91:11] and at the same time it's also really
[91:12] hard to Market when you have no special
[91:15] interest for the product um I was I made
[91:19] this I thought it was fun but there was
[91:21] no specific
[91:22] need for uh a landing page generator and
[91:25] so I'm trying to only focus on apps that
[91:28] I use so zice is because I'm I have this
[91:31] issue with
[91:33] invoices uh but is the same for uh
[91:36] recently I made by
[91:37] disputes a little tool to oh there is no
[91:40] more header in by dispute I guess I have
[91:42] to fix something yeah um yeah I made
[91:46] this little tool here to help reduce uh
[91:48] dispute from uh stripe I also made Indie
[91:52] page which is also a product that I use
[91:55] and so this is much easier for me to
[91:57] grow products like this because it's
[91:58] related to my audience it's also product
[92:00] that I use so it's uh I make updates
[92:02] that are relevant by the way if you are
[92:04] a indp page user I just release a little
[92:07] update that makes your cards um here
[92:11] much
[92:12] smaller so if you have multiple startups
[92:14] you can shring them make them smaller
[92:16] than they used to be and you will see
[92:18] this uh shape here um before the strip
[92:22] cards would take an entire space now you
[92:25] have a smaller version for
[92:26] it so yeah I'm trying to focus on apps
[92:29] that I use um especially like only I
[92:33] would use so there is a real problem on
[92:35] my side and build on top of it and if AI
[92:38] is part of the solution I would use AI
[92:39] otherwise I try to avoid
[92:41] it I try um okay your support public
[92:46] business information so this is it you
[92:48] can also default your business address
[92:51] as listed in your account
[92:53] settings
[92:57] okay always record this F okay so
[93:05] yeah the viit number we can eventually
[93:08] get it if there is one set um let's see
[93:12] how the account object looks like
[93:14] now so business profile support address
[93:18] support email support phone support URL
[93:23] okay default
[93:27] currency settings there are a bunch of
[93:31] stuff card issuing
[93:35] branding oh that's what we use yep
[93:38] dashboard payments
[93:42] payouts okay so that will be probably
[93:45] the business profile that we will be
[93:48] using
[93:50] and
[93:52] the company's primary address maybe we
[93:55] don't want to show
[94:02] that export license
[94:08] ID provided ownership declaration phone
[94:11] structure tax ID
[94:15] provided
[94:17] bit
[94:20] uhuh so it's a
[94:22] maybe we want to show the vat for if vat
[94:24] is provided maybe we want to show
[94:27] it yeah that would make sense
[94:29] so it
[94:33] is capability company so right when I'm
[94:36] connecting that thing here we're going
[94:39] to say
[94:42] vat
[94:45] and where was it
[94:50] company
[94:52] oh wait tax ID or V8 whether the
[94:54] business ID number was
[94:58] provided V ID provided but what is the V
[95:03] number
[95:08] though um maybe that's some information
[95:11] I cannot get why
[95:13] wouldn't wait that does a look on a
[95:17] proper
[95:19] invoice GB V8
[95:22] and then they have a number so maybe
[95:24] that's a tax ID or
[95:27] something merchant ID V8
[95:30] invoice oh okay V merchant ID V8 if you
[95:33] sell good a company to a business your
[95:36] mission which is a number that contains
[95:38] a country
[95:40] prefix add your relevant tax or vat ID
[95:43] by naig to manage tax
[95:45] information manage text information in
[95:47] the invoice template all right let me
[95:50] turn off my screen real quick yes I am
[95:53] on
[95:54] Twitch uh I have no clue what's my what
[95:57] my name is though let me try see if I
[95:59] find that
[96:16] link I don't even know if I'm streaming
[96:18] on Twitch uh if I am this probably not
[96:22] many
[96:23] people otherwise you will see that yes I
[96:25] am streaming on Twitch let me send you
[96:27] the
[96:35] link can I do
[96:38] that no I have to go through the stream
[96:41] wait one
[96:42] second let me see if I find it Yep this
[96:45] is
[96:48] it twitch Mark bingo
[96:59] okay going back to strip real
[97:07] quick you add the relevant taex ID by
[97:10] navigating to manage text information in
[97:12] the invoice
[97:20] templates
[97:34] invoice invoice settings maybe that's
[97:39] there oh God SL the stra API is so slow
[97:43] right
[97:45] now are you have you built anything with
[97:48] react native nope
[97:51] I haven't I use capacitor to build um
[97:56] three mobile apps it's
[97:59] a it's similar to react na in the sense
[98:01] that you use a codebase that's going to
[98:04] work for IOS and Android but the
[98:06] difference is that you don't learn any
[98:09] new language it's like you have couple
[98:11] of helper helper function and it turns
[98:13] your HTML into uh you put your HTML
[98:16] inside of a web View and it chose the
[98:18] web view to the user so you keep 90% of
[98:20] your code 98% of your
[98:26] code first
[98:34] customers
[98:39] manually business information oh okay
[98:42] that's where it is business
[98:45] settings all right I can turn on my
[98:48] screen again I
[98:50] guess
[99:07] [Music]
[99:16] nice
[99:20] hope
[99:22] right so we will uh V
[99:25] account business profile
[99:28] and is it under tax ID no I don't think
[99:34] so yeah that
[99:38] was that was that was that was that was
[99:41] so
[99:43] company is it where is it company
[99:45] there's no company
[99:47] here company and
[99:50] then we going to get the text ID
[99:53] somewhere somewhere
[100:01] somewhere the business ID was
[100:12] provided
[100:14] registered oh German based companies
[100:19] only it's fun because the direction in
[100:22] which the text
[100:23] ID is
[100:26] registered but where do we get the
[100:28] actual taex
[100:29] [Music]
[100:31] ID
[100:39] sh yeah that's the
[100:42] thing
[100:45] schedule does anyone know how to get the
[100:49] text the actual text ID from stripe API
[100:51] for a stripe
[100:56] account jic which your text ID is
[101:00] registered German based company only
[101:03] so not for
[101:05] everyone maybe V maybe it's under v80 or
[101:16] something it has to be in
[101:19] the
[101:25] okay maybe look under the business
[101:27] profile yes sir uh I think that's where
[101:29] I was but I couldn't
[101:32] see any of those it's more
[101:38] like support addressa yeah know that was
[101:41] a smart suggestion but it's
[101:48] more wait let me try my uh check my own
[101:52] strip
[101:54] accounts see if I find because I don't
[101:58] have yeah I do not have one
[102:02] yet so where would it
[102:14] be we have the business detail and the
[102:17] public business
[102:19] details
[102:29] business details public
[102:32] details and Account
[102:37] Details next oh there is a
[102:40] specific okay I think I found
[102:43] it next information
[102:47] okay we need to collect this information
[102:50] so we can sub it we can submit Accurate
[102:52] Tax report updating information M
[102:54] through new account requirements this
[102:56] see on your business information
[103:08] page okay so that's probably the best
[103:11] information and then the okay probably
[103:12] okay I think I think I'm not going to go
[103:17] too deep into that for
[103:18] [Music]
[103:19] now
[103:21] but I might want to add public business
[103:24] details to it
[103:30] though right let's get back to it this
[103:33] is the stream
[103:38] um business profile and the
[103:42] company I I don't want to touch too much
[103:45] of those
[103:46] fields
[103:48] think think yeah that would have make
[103:50] too much there okay I'm going to wait
[103:52] and if people mention it people request
[103:55] it then I will go for
[103:56] that and for now I think I'm just going
[103:59] to show if it's available the public
[104:02] business
[104:03] details
[104:05] so support I think yes support
[104:08] address and we're going to get all
[104:15] that I think business
[104:18] profile as what have mentioned and
[104:21] support
[104:23] address
[104:27] yeah
[104:32] no here we go and we can save support
[104:35] address we're going to be here and we
[104:37] are going to show okay maybe I'll I'll
[104:41] make everything a bit same like that
[104:44] support address and in the stripe
[104:46] account model I will make sure that we
[104:49] have support
[104:56] press and we're going to say tap object
[104:58] I
[105:02] guess I don't know if that's ever going
[105:05] to
[105:06] work
[105:08] anyway so now what I can do okay it has
[105:12] lost the
[105:19] phams now oh maybe I can try making sure
[105:22] that I didn't break anything so if I
[105:24] delete that strip account if I go back
[105:27] to it to that page no invoice found okay
[105:30] that makes sense so I'm going to add a
[105:32] strap account
[105:33] first creating a restricted API key for
[105:36] my Zenvo account just to
[105:39] test restricted API keys are limited are
[105:43] API keys with limited access so I get
[105:46] only information that I need with
[105:47] invoice not sensitive information this
[105:50] is a new key I just created and I am
[105:53] going to P that
[105:56] here is this going to oh I think it's
[106:00] not going to pull my business details
[106:02] because it's a test
[106:04] mode Let's
[106:07] see extra yeah it didn't pull any data
[106:10] that I needed there and we have an error
[106:13] oh
[106:15] yeah no suchar file upload yes because
[106:17] we're still in test mode okay maybe I'll
[106:19] okay maybe I'll do test real quick with
[106:21] my
[106:23] real real
[106:26] account create a real API key for a real
[106:36] account
[106:41] use well actually it's not even like I'm
[106:45] leaking API keys on a strap account that
[106:47] have
[106:49] no
[107:06] nothing okay this is
[107:09] working the real
[107:17] accounts and we have support
[107:21] address all right okay so we have more
[107:25] information
[107:38] now okay so let me share the
[107:43] screen
[107:46] although okay no I cannot use a live
[107:50] strap account
[107:52] otherwise I will simply not have
[107:55] any I think I'll need to
[107:59] duplicate oh yeah okay okay okay I'll
[108:01] add a um is tricky I'll add a local API
[108:08] key so I have local data and I can test
[108:11] with fake emails and
[108:15] then that should
[108:19] work
[108:25] so
[108:39] okay let's get back to the
[108:42] screen I mean okay so what I did it's uh
[108:47] I I copied a
[108:52] Live accounts so this is my real stripe
[108:55] account that's live in production and I
[108:58] copied the business details public
[109:00] business details to a development
[109:03] account so here I can still find invoice
[109:06] like fake invoices that I made or at
[109:07] least invoices that I made on my uh
[109:10] behalf like on this development
[109:13] environment and so as you can see
[109:16] somewhere in the database here now in
[109:18] the extra field I have information about
[109:24] um extra color and all those things like
[109:27] I have the name I have the logo of the
[109:30] startup as you can see here I know it's
[109:32] called zenice and I also have the
[109:34] support addressed field which has the
[109:38] instructions that I will publicly
[109:40] display on all my
[109:42] invoices and now it's just a matter of
[109:44] showing that on the invoice reflecting
[109:46] that on the
[109:47] invoice so going back to it
[109:56] so we have Zeno here at the top we have
[109:58] support email support address and we are
[110:00] going to copy the stripe invoice
[110:03] template which was maybe there
[110:07] nope
[110:13] no let's try invoice
[110:15] [Music]
[110:19] format was here
[110:22] okay we are going to copy that so name
[110:25] of the business address
[110:28] support email support phone and so in
[110:32] the
[110:34] invoice page
[110:37] content support email what was
[110:40] it yep
[110:43] here we are going to
[110:47] say if
[111:02] that's oh wait actually maybe I need to
[111:04] format this thing a little
[111:10] bit uh I'm going to say address
[111:15] C no clue what this
[111:17] is what do we get
[111:20] maybe line one line two line one line
[111:24] two country
[111:29] City oh maybe line one line two okay
[111:32] it's the tricky
[111:36] part line
[111:39] one line
[111:43] two oh I think GPT knows C yes but
[111:48] no uh
[111:51] I think probably okay that would be
[111:54] state city state country was it city
[111:59] state country city state country and the
[112:02] postal code where is the postal code
[112:07] here um bordo ah this is my country it's
[112:11] it's a bit easier I'm going to be using
[112:13] this one okay line
[112:16] one
[112:17] uh the format
[112:22]  Lane one lane
[112:25] two bordo
[112:35] is so maybe City and postal
[112:47] code okay I think actually ch was
[112:50] actually
[112:51] right I think I was
[112:53] to city state postal code uh bingo and
[112:57] Country okay I should have listened to J
[113:01] GPT
[113:03] um we probably won't to filter forat for
[113:13] uh
[113:14] format the
[113:18] support
[113:21] account
[113:24] support
[113:26] address like below
[113:29] remove any empty
[113:33] values do not add a line if
[113:42] there's no
[113:45] value programming in
[113:48] 2024
[113:54] hey come on give me something don't let
[113:57] me do hit B
[113:59] okay um okay support line one line
[114:05] two bam I Love You chpt country to code
[114:08] name let's see if that
[114:12] works oh we have something I need to
[114:16] push that uh oh because I think
[114:20] this is a key part oh yeah yeah
[114:27] yeah
[114:29] um they would
[114:32] I
[114:35] join so I filter I join
[114:42] them say how
[114:46] to uh
[114:48] count
[114:50] or light
[114:53] break to use light bre
[114:56] say display
[115:04] blog little new
[115:18] here
[115:26] how do I respect mod I I forget how
[115:31] to make sure that CSS respects
[115:35] the line breaks maybe I can find what I
[115:38] did
[115:39] here oh
[115:45] no
[115:48] um oh I think it's it has to do with the
[115:51] wi space
[115:58] somewhere you could print a light Yeah
[116:03] Boy dude I love this join
[116:07] um fter
[116:10] and let me see the empty values won't
[116:14] show
[116:15] automatically and you rock let's see how
[116:18] how we can do that
[116:24] here I have the
[116:31] R I think I need to
[116:35] map and
[116:48] return yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay
[116:51] let's try let's see if Jud yep there we
[116:56] go thanks man really appreciate it much
[116:59] easier like this
[117:03] way actually I don't need that
[117:09] here here we
[117:12] go where did they mess up right
[117:18] here
[117:25] okay invoice the address one address two
[117:29] here we have a duplicate because it's
[117:30] Singapore so that makes
[117:32] sense we have a weird spacing here that
[117:34] I need to fix real
[117:37] quick
[117:39] um oh yes because I have this
[117:44] thing I don't need to do
[117:48] that
[117:57] okay I think this is this should be
[117:59] working um support address. City support
[118:03] address. States and postal
[118:14] code uh there might be a little
[118:16] something country code to country name
[118:21] what did I do here so that is the postal
[118:24] code
[118:27] okay line one line
[118:30] two we have another
[118:33] array oh and then finally we have the
[118:36] country address
[118:45] oops city state postal code okay and
[118:49] here here just
[118:50] here we are supposed to
[118:53] [Music]
[119:02] have oh okay no okay that's perfect
[119:06] that's good that's
[119:18] good
[119:25] [Music]
[119:27] sorry for the size of the screen I'm
[119:29] trying to understand not zoomed in or am
[119:37] I keep it this way little zoom and we
[119:41] are good to
[119:46] go I think this is good
[119:51] if there is a support email we show it
[119:52] if there's support email address we show
[119:55] it business name build
[119:59] to that looks like a proper invoice
[120:02] finally does that function country code
[120:05] to country name even exist yeah yeah
[120:07] yeah actually I it's a chpt written
[120:11] that's why I forget it exists but I
[120:13] think I probably have used it for
[120:15] another part like this part of the
[120:18] invoice
[120:20] just forget you know that it even
[120:25] existed okay I think this is this is
[120:28] fine download
[120:33] invoice um we maybe would check the
[120:36] format of the invoice is it
[120:40] good all
[120:45] right maybe I want to uh
[120:50] create a better canvas cuz
[120:53] here let's
[120:56] see yeah that's the thing people will
[120:59] get different invoices based on
[121:01] different
[121:04] devices country code
[121:06] name edit invoice screenshot
[121:15] invoice HTML to image yeah let me see
[121:18] that
[121:28] oh my God I start to be hungry I think
[121:29] I'll need to eat a little thing in order
[121:32] to be able to think a
[121:33] [Music]
[121:36] little so now we're going to do PNG
[121:40] invoice and current formats quity
[121:44] [Music]
[121:47] background and which
[122:05] change I have
[122:07] to do pixel
[122:13] data so we take the
[122:17] node
[122:21] to SVG
[122:36] nope
[122:39] react options
[122:42] [Music]
[122:43] filter the function thinging do not as
[122:46] argument should return true if pass
[122:51] you can filter every
[122:55] image oh that is smart oh wow that's
[122:58] cool quality filter background color
[123:02] nope pleas and a b to be applied to the
[123:05] node before rendering that is probably
[123:08] what this or the
[123:11] other what are we even trying to do here
[123:14] um all right
[123:16] so let me show you so these is the
[123:20] invoice the download button here calls
[123:24] the function here screenshot invoice
[123:29] which is going to use the library HTML
[123:31] to
[123:33] image and make a PNG out of this uh HTML
[123:38] node so in the
[123:42] code in here on the model that pops up
[123:45] when you see the invoice there is this
[123:47] section
[123:49] here with ref equal invoice ref that is
[123:52] basically the entire node that will be
[123:55] uh
[123:57] screenshot and the thing is if you are
[124:00] using a laptop like mine right now the
[124:02] format is okay but if you're using a
[124:05] tablet or if you're using a
[124:07] phone it is not correct um let me show
[124:10] you if I rescreen I resize let's say I
[124:13] have a very tiny
[124:16] phone you will see you have this invoice
[124:18] that's for this way it's basically
[124:20] formatted the same way as the phones the
[124:23] phone thing um if I have a bigger screen
[124:27] like this one the invoice will look like
[124:31] this so if you put them side by side you
[124:34] have either this or
[124:39] that so I
[124:41] think there might be an
[124:44] answer somewhere here in the
[124:47] canvas
[124:50] to scale the canvas size including the
[124:52] element
[124:56] inside with Excel to be applied to the
[124:59] node so maybe or maybe just this
[125:02] then we need the fix withd
[125:05] exactly exactly sir
[125:10] um and so HTML to regardless of CST
[125:17] yep
[125:21] let's say
[125:26] width light all right I'm going to give
[125:29] this a little try see if that
[125:39] works okay there something
[125:42] happened that's for sure right my my
[125:45] computer is completely B I have never
[125:48] seen that that
[125:49] okay this doesn't really look
[125:52] like the proper format
[125:57] oh oh I think I know what it
[126:01] did no I don't
[126:06] know oh yes okay so that's okay the
[126:10] format is actually right but it did not
[126:12] feel the page I
[126:16] think maybe not
[126:19] uh what is the form what is the size of
[126:21] this
[126:23] image is it the last one is this
[126:27] one it is way bigger than
[126:32] expected 40
[126:35] Zed
[126:36] by 1.7 1.77
[126:47] okay okay that's the format the right
[126:50] format oh because I'm using a retina
[126:52] display okay that makes
[126:54] sense try on mobile and see if you get
[126:57] the same photo size yeah yeah let's try
[127:00] I think I
[127:01] will it's actually using the
[127:06] format and
[127:09] no
[127:12] nope what format do we get
[127:17] there
[127:20] we are getting we are getting the
[127:21] similar Dimension but the oh I
[127:26] think if it's the same then it's working
[127:28] we just need to play around with the
[127:30] perfect format oh
[127:32] okay yeah I think yeah both are
[127:35] different like I think the HTML is still
[127:37] not
[127:38] feeling like you have this make this
[127:47] bigger
[127:50] because I think yeah it's going to take
[127:52] the
[127:56] entire right try something else think
[128:00] it's a mix probably of playing around
[128:02] with the width and the
[128:05] height and the canva width and canva
[128:09] height canva size including the elements
[128:13] [Music]
[128:14] inside that is probably it quality the
[128:18] cash burst includ holder pi
[128:22] [Music]
[128:26] ratio default use the actual P said
[128:29] maybe I want to set this to one so I
[128:32] don't I have
[128:33] [Music]
[128:36] a see you try
[128:40] again yeah the invoice is a bit smaller
[128:47] now and this is supposed to
[128:55] be okay
[129:01] one
[129:05] okay the
[129:07] height I think I'm confused though the
[129:14] width it looks like
[129:16] it's it's not Ching the right
[129:21] width or it's swapping width well it's
[129:24] probably me but it's swapping the width
[129:27] and the
[129:31] height let's see it
[129:35] again oh no okay okay okay it's just the
[129:38] canvas inside is not being displayed
[129:40] okay otherwise I think the format
[129:44] is on the way um invoice
[129:50] A4 paper
[130:01] format typical A4 format what is
[130:07] it 21 mm by I think invoice should be
[130:10] around this size so
[130:12] 21 well actually I can do
[130:16] this uh
[130:25] do that
[130:35] up do we get here all right the format
[130:39] okay I think the this aspect ratio is
[130:44] better now I need to
[130:47] probably uh
[130:55] [Music]
[130:56] 60
[131:00] 297
[131:11] 0.7
[131:17] 155
[131:19] yeah no
[131:21] no
[131:23] [Music]
[131:26] 75 5 76
[131:31] 7
[131:32] [Music]
[131:34] 756 right let's try so getting back to
[131:37] it we have an invoice we download it in
[131:40] the
[131:42] format oh it's SE the
[131:47] opposite
[131:56] okay that is better looks like the right
[131:59] aspect ratio now I think I have to play
[132:01] with the canvas whatever this
[132:04] night and can say let's see if that
[132:09] change
[132:17] anything voice down know we
[132:21] have what do we have
[132:33] okay oh boy I think I'll be back in a
[132:35] minute I need to have a little snack so
[132:40] my brain can
[132:43] work I'll leave a code
[132:46] here be back
[132:55] he
[133:16] when
[134:17] work
[144:53] hey welcome back was having a little
[144:56] break for food need to drink a little
[144:59] something um we just need to play around
[145:02] the perfect format is not fix it the
[145:04] recommend solution to use HTML to canva
[145:06] package instead HTML to kvas okay uh
[145:10] HTML to can a man maybe I lost you maybe
[145:13] you're probably gone if you're still
[145:15] around HTML to
[145:23] um
[145:26] okay screenshot okay and then
[145:32] any screenshot with JavaScript and then
[145:35] how do
[145:36] you happen to
[145:39] body how do you turn that into a
[145:45] picture
[145:47] I'm probably going to try both all right
[145:49] I'm going to try to finish if I I see
[145:52] something there prefer font formats font
[145:54] EMB say keep Auto scale the never will
[145:57] keep the process of scaling extra
[146:05] large I need
[146:09] to to scale the canvas
[146:12] size including all the elements inside a
[146:16] given withd and pixel
[146:18] so let's get back to it this is my
[146:28] invoice size
[146:31] is correct but the content inside is not
[146:35] filling the
[146:36] invoice that is what we want to
[146:44] do is to canv uh no it removes the
[146:48] canvas at some point right
[146:54]  we applied to the node before
[147:02] rendering width and height in pixels to
[147:04] be apply to the no before
[147:11] rendering I'll be trying a few things um
[147:15] if I remove that
[147:21] hard how does it
[147:24] look oh
[147:30] okay
[147:38] oh it looks like it's taking a
[147:40] screenshots first and
[147:45] then
[147:50] and then it's making the it's rescaling
[147:53] the
[147:59] invoice that is a tricky one
[148:03] um width and height the pixel to be
[148:05] applied to note before
[148:09] rendering just curious if I double
[148:14] that I'm going to try a bunch of of
[148:16] random stuff to see if I figure
[148:18] something
[148:23] out
[148:24] okay we have a big
[148:34] stuff let's see what we get
[148:40] here
[148:45] oh
[148:57] [Music]
[149:09] me
[149:14] 2,000 I think I'm going to this put this
[149:17] to one for
[149:17] [Music]
[149:19] now this is the output we get we're
[149:45] getting I think
[149:52] um remove
[149:58] that what is the difference between
[150:00] those
[150:01] two if there is any
[150:06] difference no okay this is exactly the
[150:12] same what if we make this 10 times
[150:15] bigger
[150:29]  it's bugging my
[150:38] computer all right I think I crashed the
[150:40] computer with
[150:45] that
[150:47] just
[150:48] happen I sent a GitHub hu link but
[150:52] YouTube seems to block it Yep looks like
[150:54] you're still block yeah yeah yeah can I
[150:57] come and play Playstation with
[151:00] you uh that'll cost you 20 bucks per
[151:02] session but yeah you can
[151:05] come you should your name should be
[151:08] called not maker box by the way to be
[151:10] relevant with I can
[151:12] use I crashed my entire stuff
[151:15] um
[151:17] HTML okay let me try
[151:35] this thanks man this is
[151:38] legendary
[151:45] issue
[151:49] oh it's not going to let me copy past
[151:52] probably come on come on come on come
[151:55] on
[152:05] okay HTML to
[152:11] image is
[152:13] it I'm confused now is it the package
[152:16] that I'm using or is it the one you
[152:20] recommended I think it's the one yeah
[152:22] okay that's the one I'm using Okay a
[152:24] specific
[152:25] [Music]
[152:30] res
[152:35] uhuh well currently move HTML much
[152:38] because on using HTML 2 canvas
[152:42] okay oh getting the image okay maybe
[152:46] that's actually much simpler used HTML
[152:49] to Canvas
[152:50] instead okay everybody is saying to use
[152:52] HTML to Canvas
[152:54] instead all right I think I'm going to
[152:57] use that
[153:01] um
[153:03] npm
[153:04] and
[153:07] install there's the name of it
[153:10] uh HTML to
[153:15] image
[153:23] install oh no no
[153:43] no okay back to
[153:46] this um we're going to
[153:57] try is
[154:00] called import HTML to
[154:02] [Music]
[154:06] Canvas and here we
[154:09] are
[154:14] this create the link send screenshotting
[154:17] equal
[154:26] false and we want to do it on the
[154:28] invoice.
[154:29] [Music]
[154:33] currents window width background
[154:38] color for now I'm going to leave
[154:43] whatever link or download it is going to
[154:45] be go this
[154:47] way gpeg
[154:50] okay and this will be
[154:53] removed all right let's give it a try
[154:58] live see how much I
[155:15] bugged
[155:18] I'm going to have to do a few tries with
[155:19] this uh let's say imagine this is a
[155:22] tablet and it's cropped that's for some
[155:26] reason
[155:30] download
[155:32] yep I probably need to set the
[155:37] window
[155:41] height window width oh no actually it's
[155:43] the opposite I want to do
[155:51] what we going to get
[155:53] here wow that's a big
[155:57] invoice but it looks like it's working
[156:00] man I think I just need to change some
[156:04] of the
[156:06] numbers um we good I think this was a
[156:09] good format the
[156:11] height and the
[156:14] width let's try
[156:20] again all right I think this is
[156:22] it I think we have oh
[156:26] no
[156:29] it's oh maybe I need to double it okay
[156:31] okay okay okay
[156:37] um see you
[156:41] later
[156:44] canas
[156:49] what is the format of that image
[156:58] ension the dimensions are quite big it's
[157:01] probably because it's
[157:06] double height oh okay okay okay okay
[157:09] okay okay I think I will need to do this
[157:12] and I need to
[157:13] export I think this would work
[157:17] probably have to change a little
[157:18] parameter after that could work
[157:25] out
[157:27] nope what did I do
[157:38] here 2
[157:44] two
[157:59] now what do we have as properties if
[158:03] any
[158:12] options CH to Canvas and we need to
[158:15] passess on the option
[158:27] F same origin is it
[158:31] uh oh wow
[158:36] sick oh that's that's a very
[158:40] cool oh that's a smart smart
[158:44] smart
[158:47] documentation
[158:55] okay
[158:57] configuration background color set to n
[159:00] null for transparent so that what we
[159:07] want whether to cross origin
[159:10] images Pro
[159:14] Image
[159:16] [Music]
[159:29] skill that is right what is
[159:44] this
[159:46] right that looks pretty good that
[159:49] actually looks pretty good
[159:54] no it's not bad let's
[159:57] see what kind of image we get from here
[160:02] um it
[160:05] is don't
[160:10] know and we have this Dimensions so the
[160:14] aspect ratio is good
[160:18] we just ah it's
[160:26] still if we play around and we see this
[160:30] actually what is the the one I'm
[160:34] using window the defense Pi
[160:37] [Music]
[160:38] rue two okay yeah display use cord width
[160:44] height
[160:46] window width and window height
[160:57] Okay window with to
[161:01] use which may affect things like media
[161:03] curries yes that is exactly what's
[161:05] happening right now
[161:14] um 07 let's say we
[161:17] [Music]
[161:23] want
[161:26] 7 1 5 4
[161:30] 3 4 or
[161:36] two see one more
[161:44] time
[161:53] maybe if now we play around with the
[162:07] wi give me
[162:14] something
[162:38] uh
[162:40] okay oh yeah
[162:44] okay you don't scale
[162:49] it we don't scale what we going to
[162:57] get think we can keep this kill to two
[163:01] uh the window
[163:04] width think maybe I don't need to set
[163:06] the window Heights actually maybe you
[163:09] will
[163:13] decide yes of course this
[163:20] beautiful
[163:27] uh let's try something
[163:44] random width and height the width of
[163:47] the all right I guess I'm
[163:50] tired I'll have a little lunch prank oh
[163:54] see remove the window height and give it
[163:57] just the remove the okay remove the
[164:00] window height yep and give it just the
[164:02] height
[164:05] property uh
[164:14] okay I remove the window height and
[164:16] maybe I'll give it
[164:28] uh
[164:31] see
[164:33] here why do you put this background now
[164:36] that
[164:44] is
[164:57] I
[165:13] think I me we are going to play with a
[165:16] bunch of
[165:20] parameters oh actually maybe the window
[165:23] height should
[165:36] be let's see what we get
[165:38] here maybe I should use the actual
[165:41] height of the window yeah
[165:44] that
[165:50] okay at least well this is not bad this
[165:52] is actually working um if I put it very
[165:55] tiny let's
[165:57] see it's still working uh I do not have
[166:01] something missing
[166:04] here
[166:10] um yeah I need to fix
[166:14] that
[166:20] well at least it is working uh we have a
[166:24] proper
[166:25] window scale two let's see if we do some
[166:29] weird stuff
[166:31] like I don't know
[166:38] this still
[166:40] working uh if we do something like
[166:43] proper screenshots
[166:47] still working and if we do a very tiny
[166:51] screenshots for
[166:54] fun
[167:03]  okay this is still working okay and
[167:05] the quality is
[167:07] good we just need to fix the this little
[167:11] thing
[167:13] here
[167:15] yeah something is wrong with the
[167:17] formatting but otherwise not
[167:22] bad okay not bad not
[167:25] bad all right we have
[167:31] something and the image is
[167:35] 3K
[167:43] pixels
[167:47] okay curious if I just put this
[167:50] here the
[167:52] difference yeah quality is a bit
[167:54] now
[167:59] okay all right I
[168:03] guess I guess this is
[168:08] better just curious about
[168:13] that
[168:15] no that doesn't change anything
[168:18] okay maybe we can do
[168:25] invoice scroll maybe maybe C another
[168:29] work for that
[168:34] uh ah yeah
[168:43] okay um
[168:51] yes it's okay that was not a really good
[168:58] idea get back to it and
[169:02] see
[169:08] okay actually I think we don't need to
[169:10] go
[169:13] that
[169:31] see if we see something like
[169:35] 756 what is going to happen
[169:40] here okay that starts to look
[169:43] weird
[169:46] yes
[169:47] okay I think this is a proper invoice
[169:50] format I need to fix these
[169:52] borders trange borders somewhere
[170:00] there for some reason for why what would
[170:03] happen
[170:09] here oh
[170:13] okay
[170:24] how many invoices am I going to
[170:26] download okay all right I think this is
[170:29] good um we going to keep those settings
[170:32] I will need to fix this border and the
[170:36] layout here is not
[170:38] right probably because I have missed
[170:43] something
[170:52] finally set
[170:58] screenshotting I think I need to eat
[171:01] I'll keep the live here why not PDF um
[171:05] you're why not PDF I think uh I don't
[171:08] know how to extract PDFs from H HTML
[171:12] actually why not uh if you have if know
[171:14] any Library that's better than
[171:16] mine I'll be happy too um hello
[171:20] Flora your G screen is a beat off yeah
[171:23] that's true you can see what is that
[171:26] that you oh this is my
[171:31] sofa there we
[171:34] go and hide in same Dimension so you
[171:36] need to find the balance between the two
[171:38] okay the dimension of the image window
[171:41] height and window width are dimension of
[171:43] the window when you take the screenshot
[171:46] okay so we are
[171:50] saying okay and the height and dimension
[171:53] of the
[171:54] image that makes sense okay I think I'm
[171:57] going to stick to these
[172:02] parameters it might be easier than HTML
[172:05] to image yeah it could be I just don't
[172:07] know how to I just don't know how to do
[172:09] it um if you have any any
[172:13] clue I will be uh happy to give it a
[172:16] try microphone that falls down on the
[172:18] mic on the mic book I am going to have a
[172:21] little
[172:22] lunch the wife is gone so I'll be having
[172:26] lunch here if anyone wants to
[172:30] share so at
[172:34] sometime this
[172:36] is the lunch that doesn't look good from
[172:40] here oh I think oh that is a fun thing
[172:43] it is removing the salad the green salad
[172:47] because of the green screen that's
[172:48] behind me so it looks like there's some
[172:50] moist mushrooms in my
[172:53] plates this is actually salad in the
[173:13] middle
[173:25] yeah the green screen is completely off
[173:28] oh
[173:43] wow

[173:51] exactly what it
[173:53] is G in oh

[174:13] too
[175:18] fix
[175:27] that
[175:43] sick
[175:58] um the last question Nishant I think you
[176:00] said about when you say I launch so many
[176:05] products only has landing pages does it
[176:08] mean that you got paying customers for
[176:10] Sal product without a product no most of
[176:14] my actually only one of my products
[176:19] didn't exist before I sold it this was
[176:21] something I did uh I think five years
[176:23] ago
[176:24] something that was the first time I sold
[176:27] something before I buy it I sold
[176:29] something before I build it and now
[176:31] every time I uh sell something and I
[176:34] launch with a landing page there is a
[176:43] product
[178:05] overflow somehow is off
[178:12] yes
[178:42] um
[179:42] f
[181:12] Maybe
[182:12] he
[182:33] okay react PDF G that's
[182:36] it thanks
[182:42] dar
[182:57] I'll probably yeah I think that
[183:00] requires decent amount of work
[183:12] here
[183:19] I'll be I think I could I could I could
[183:22] do it I'll wait if um you know if if the
[183:27] app get customers and customers want to
[183:30] have a pdf version of it that's
[183:32] something I could I could do I think
[183:34] it's probably a little bit of a work for
[183:35] this first version
[183:37] probably I appreciate the
[183:42] sharan
[184:25] [Music]
[184:42] only
[187:36] maybe
[187:38] f
[187:42] um
[188:02] point
[188:12] Y
[188:26] console
[188:39] Logue
[188:42] see
[189:05] I don't think
[189:11] so
[189:31] not
[189:41] working
[189:44] hello s what is the issue here
[189:49] um and thanks uh thanks for tuning in
[189:52] for a multiple stream then I appreciate
[189:53] it um the issue is when I download the
[189:57] invoice I use a little HTML uh sorry
[189:59] little JavaScript function and text here
[190:03] is not
[190:06] wrapping if I conso log that thing the
[190:08] value here you can see it's this thing
[190:11] so this is wrapping
[190:15] but it's not in there and so I'm trying
[190:18] to understand why which CSS property
[190:21] property did I mess
[190:27] up is he using GitHub co-pilot yes
[190:41] sir
[190:46] [Music]
[191:07] see to see where did I mess
[191:11] up
[191:14] here wait
[191:41] what
[191:47] using um I'm using OBS for streaming and
[191:50] I'm using restream to multistream to um
[191:54] stream to Twitter and YouTube word WP
[191:58] break
[192:00] word there we go
[192:11] legend
[192:36] oh the height of low resize vertical
[192:40] word break break
[192:41] wordss
[192:43] still it does want takes area
[192:45] transparency

[193:27] yeah it could be could
[193:41] be
[193:50] I mean yeah I could use the window
[193:52] prints it's a smart move I think I'm
[193:54] just so close to Mak it work as soon as
[193:58] I get this little thing wrapping the
[193:59] text wrapping uh it's good that's why
[194:02] I'm trying to S stick with the solution
[194:04] until it's
[194:11] fixed
[194:33] here you go I think it breaks this bre
[194:38] fix
[194:39] area you've try what space for
[194:43] uh yes I think I
[195:02] did yeah for some reason it doesn't work
[195:05] used used I used to use to have a
[195:07] different package to um to make a
[195:09] screenshots and it was working for some
[195:13] reason this package making does make
[195:41] it
[195:59] so weird
[196:10] yeah when you C
[196:31] sure that's a weird
[196:37] thing
[196:41] maybe
[197:11] no
[197:29] yeah maybe I'm ignoring something
[197:32] here
[197:41] um
[197:59] otherwise I'm going to do a very
[198:02] boring
[198:04] thing I'm done
[198:07] eating can you show the code yep yes sir
[198:10] so this is the text area
[198:22] and this has a ref here this has a ref
[198:27] here that's oops that's
[198:29] updated um when I take a
[198:33] screenshots it turns on a Boolean and
[198:35] it's also make a few updates on that
[198:38] thing to make sure that I had the the
[198:40] cursor that little thing that you can
[198:42] use to move the window and that the size
[198:45] the height of that thing is the right
[198:48] size the right height with all the
[198:54] content which is working in sense do the
[198:57] image generating code okay okay yeah
[199:00] this is
[199:01] it this part
[199:04] here and then
[199:10] uh yeah this is working if I make it
[199:12] super
[199:13] big it is going to resize it so that is
[199:17] not an issue it's just the wrapping with
[199:19] X damn
[199:33] it
[199:41] overflow
[200:10] strife
[200:14] damn
[200:21] it of course not it's fun because he
[200:24] used to work with the previous Library I
[200:26] was
[200:40] using
[201:08] love
[201:10] you
[201:37] I'm drinking some weird stuff just to
[201:40] see guess
[201:49] otherwise I think I'm going
[201:58] to oh it's actually not creating
[202:05] the nothing is actually
[202:10] happening
[202:21] let's break break
[202:29] all is it actually overflow
[202:33] r word
[202:40] break
[202:49] all right I think this uh text area
[202:51] thing is bothering
[202:54] us I'm going to have to kill
[202:57] it maybe what I can do is I can
[203:01] create replace it doing the screenshot
[203:05] by Dives basic div like you said for the
[203:12] the per the address from the bilder
[203:21] side
[203:24] yeah I try to
[203:26] to to sorry I cannot even speak anymore
[203:29] I tried to comment all the code it's
[203:31] still not
[203:36] working also coding with one hand
[203:39] doesn't really help I'm almost done with
[203:41] my
[203:42] and I'll get sery back at
[204:05] it it is
[204:07] nuts oh did
[204:10] wait
[204:51] can we not change the height okay I'll
[204:52] give it a try what's your usual
[204:57] lunch bunch of vegetables um some meat
[205:01] or fish or eggs um a little bit of beans
[205:04] uh not beans how it called quinoa grains
[205:08] I think it's
[205:10] called
[205:12] and yeah I think that's pretty much it
[205:15] ARs and all that all the kind of
[205:20] stuff I think the issue is not happening
[205:22] because of T but with the scaling and
[205:24] the fixed height of wi you're providing
[205:27] okay okay I'm going to give this a right
[205:30] okay morning just woke up what are you
[205:32] up to Mark yo
[205:34] Julian just woke up I guess somewhere in
[205:38] Europe um we are building a stripe in
[205:41] invoice generator
[205:43] So to avoid paying
[205:45] 0.4% per invoice generated on
[205:49] stripe I'm eting the
[205:59] S all right I'll pull my plate uh in the
[206:04] sync and I will be back trying what you
[206:05] just said
[206:10] see
[208:16] he welcome
[208:18] back now a quick
[208:29] launch dude this this guy I love him I
[208:32] think I discovered him when he was just
[208:35] getting started and I was I felt in love
[208:38] instantly I love The Vibes I love
[208:40] everything he's doing
[208:44] doing
[208:59] Mark absolute
[209:06] Legend like the pit levels of
[209:10] music
[209:16] what best friends much the birthday
[209:18] amen you can see you can see that I have
[209:21] binged all of his
[209:24] videos actually absolutely all of
[209:29] them no not not just a
[209:33] fan
[209:36] okay function
[209:38] 10 okay wa watch all right time to
[209:47] build okay so we have a potential fix
[209:51] here from C that
[209:53] says function 10 10 with with with it
[210:00] takes looked at one of the issue for the
[210:02] library one possible solution is using
[210:03] div with content editable instead of
[210:06] text area okay
[210:10] okay
[210:14] oh that's actually quite
[210:16] smart he takes param
[210:22] XYZ of giving a fixed weight can you
[210:24] replace your Dynamic height and
[210:35] width
[210:40] o
[210:48] um where were we okay so this did not
[210:51] work um so you're suggesting to give it
[210:54] a height actually the height is actually
[210:57] Auto I think oh no okay it's a fixed
[210:58] height here right if I just keep Theo
[211:01] Auto Heights overflow this will not
[211:05] break anything okay and we are
[211:07] downloading
[211:09] it right still not working um I think I
[211:14]  up somewhere as well because
[211:16] because because because um what I'm
[211:18] doing
[211:19] here I set this Boolean to
[211:23] true
[211:24] and
[211:30] um these Boolean
[211:36] here we're getting back to it okay
[211:39] here it's supposed to
[211:45] do X area
[211:56] bordered oh you're okay okay okay so
[211:58] you're talking about the remove
[212:00] this it
[212:03] is it is
[212:06] reing okay so you would remove that
[212:08] thing here let me let me know if I'm a
[212:10] mistaken you would remove that
[212:16] part let's see if we get something
[212:18] better within I
[212:26] know wait you're saying that I
[212:31] should you see someone mentioned like
[212:34] this issue comments no another part okay
[212:36] another
[212:39] part
[212:43] damn I can click the links on my
[213:00] phone okay okay I think that's what wam
[213:03] was mentioning just
[213:09] before and continue element or could use
[213:11] replac CH method instead of
[213:17] setting your text are elements in
[213:21] containing elements or you could just
[213:23] use replace CH
[213:25] method okay let's try all
[213:33] that
[213:39] um uh wait replace right I have no
[213:56] even oh
[214:05] wow okay those are pretty
[214:09] cool
[214:18] [Music]
[214:30] all right maybe we can try
[214:39] that
[214:50] for each sck
[214:51] Cal okay I'm going to be bold and
[214:58] try okay we have a little
[215:09] something
[215:15] what are we trying to do to the text
[215:16] area we are
[215:18] trying to make this tech text area
[215:21] behave like the way should it's supposed
[215:26] to no it's a it's I think it's just a
[215:29] bug with the library and it's no big
[215:35] deal known start petting okay maybe we
[215:38] can change
[215:39] that
[215:41] for
[215:42] each adding 01 fit
[215:46] contents we don't want
[215:49] probably right let's give it a
[215:57] try
[216:01] okay
[216:06] actually I'm going to use all my MacBook
[216:12] storage having a million
[216:16] invoices I think this is working better
[216:19] now um let's check if
[216:24] the can I zoom more on that yet let's
[216:28] see if it's
[216:30] aligned
[216:37] properly I think it is aligning properly
[216:43] what do you guys think I think this is
[216:45] good
[216:50] actually let's say if I add my V8
[216:52] numbers and I add a white space maybe
[216:56] another what space here and I download
[217:00] this right this is good this is pretty
[217:09] good hold
[217:18] Ora from
[217:20] Madera I think the invoice is
[217:24] working quality is not too bad we add V8
[217:28] details we have all
[217:30] that
[217:36] um yep uh congrats to actually congrats
[217:40] to to you guys I am just
[217:42] um actually I'm a junior programmer and
[217:45] I just follow what you guys said uh this
[217:48] is working thank you everyone for the
[217:52] collaboration let's double check one
[217:54] more
[217:57] run right I I I
[218:05] okay
[218:08] and maybe we remove if T
[218:12] here
[218:36] M maybe we do something like um
[218:45] remove um not space
[218:47] remove empty
[218:56] lines
[218:57] hey no idea what I'm doing someone is
[219:00] doing it for me copilot you did some
[219:03] magic
[219:09] congratulation all right I think this is
[219:10] good this is working okay I'm going to
[219:13] push that
[219:14] and we will be
[219:17] happy
[219:20] um updates
[219:23] know I think we can move on with the
[219:26] probably with the Ling page
[219:31] now everything is working feedback
[219:35] boxs have a link all right all right if
[219:38] you're tuning in um I am making a strip
[219:41] invoice generator and editor or people
[219:44] like me who would use onetime payments
[219:48] uh stripe will not generate an invoice
[219:50] by default for
[219:51] you unless you turn on the option that
[219:54] cost 0.4% of the entire invoice which on
[219:58] the long run is very expensive so what
[220:01] I'm doing is a little alternative to
[220:04] that uh people can connect their strap
[220:06] accounts let me show
[220:09] you um you connect your strap accounts
[220:11] here you can add as many as you want and
[220:13] then you have a unique link that you can
[220:15] share with your customer when they say
[220:17] can I get an invoice or can I update my
[220:19] invoice you give them the link they can
[220:21] type in their
[220:23] emails it's going to search if they have
[220:25] made any purchase with your business if
[220:28] it if they did they will have the
[220:30] ability to send a link a private link so
[220:33] that they can download edit and do
[220:36] whatever they want with their invoices
[220:38] so I'm going to my mailbox and I should
[220:40] get the Z invoice
[220:42] link edit and download your invoices
[220:44] with this link I click it and it's going
[220:47] to fetch all my inv my invoices that I
[220:50] made with the business um it's using a
[220:53] token right here that is stored in a
[220:57] database right uh right right right
[221:00] right
[221:01] there bingo that have a 24 hours
[221:06] expiring date and is only valid for
[221:09] people who receive the email once I'm
[221:12] here um well I can view the invoice and
[221:15] I can download it if I want but I can
[221:18] also I'm checking as well like
[221:20] everything is working I can also if I
[221:23] desire um update some stuff like I can
[221:25] change my name because I made a typo I
[221:28] can add my vat
[221:31] number if needed all going to add a
[221:34] little white space just for fun and I
[221:37] can redownload the invoice and normally
[221:39] it is updated there we go this is
[221:42] working and this
[221:46] beautiful I think that's a pretty much a
[221:48] wrap for the product uh
[221:50] unless I'm probably going to share this
[221:52] with a couple of my friends and see what
[221:54] they think about it and if it's working
[221:57] for them I think I will not touch the
[221:58] product until I start launching
[222:01] it
[222:02] um which bring us to
[222:05] the uh marketing part where we going to
[222:08] build the link page
[222:11] and for now we have an entirely empty
[222:14] page as you can see
[222:17] here oops maybe I want to use
[222:23] this that's the Ling page for now so
[222:25] nothing much going on out
[222:38] there H also we we had
[222:43] Nico which you guys probably know if
[222:45] you're on
[222:47] Twitter who came on
[222:49] the live stream a couple days ago and
[222:53] together we made the copyrighting
[222:56] for yeah we built the copyrighting for
[222:59] this um
[223:01] products and so we have
[223:05] um headlines we Define like who would be
[223:09] using that what would be what are some
[223:11] good
[223:12] headlines um sub headlines
[223:16] description we wrote some text and
[223:18] normally I should copy past this and
[223:21] have a landing page to pin up a little
[223:23] bit
[223:36] faster thank you K now I realize I spent
[223:40] a lot of uh I did actually spend a lot
[223:43] of money on stripe invoices I had the
[223:45] option turned on I didn't
[223:48] realize and I don't know I think I
[223:50] probably send stripe $1,000 worth of
[223:53] invoices for that
[223:56] option so I'm going to yeah try to you
[224:00] know build my own little solution for
[224:02] that because there a bunch of customers
[224:04] who actually don't need invoices uh
[224:06] receipts are enough but the problem is
[224:08] some of them knew need them so when you
[224:10] don't have the invoice it's a bit
[224:12] annoying to make them by
[224:17] hand any chance you could change the dog
[224:20] as a template
[224:24] yes um yeah okay and probably at the end
[224:27] of the stream when I'm done copy pasting
[224:29] all that I will make it open source and
[224:32] I mean not open source but I don't know
[224:34] how you call that for
[224:36] copyrighting but uh yeah I'll probably
[224:38] make the template public so you guys can
[224:39] use
[224:42] it right so I think for the invoice we
[224:45] are going to do
[224:48] something yes we're going to have an app
[224:51] that do similar thing like as this one
[224:53] so here we're going to have I think that
[224:56] will be the demo for the
[224:58] product there are going to be some
[225:00] notification that says hey can I get an
[225:03] invoice hey if you didn't if you don't
[225:06] send me an invoice I'm going to ask for
[225:08] a refund or oh please can you add my
[225:10] business detail to the
[225:12] invoice these kind of things which I
[225:15] think could uh you know could could be
[225:18] fun for uh you know to like as a as a
[225:22] something you see for the first time
[225:23] when you land on on the page that will
[225:24] instantly
[225:26] trigger the moment where because not
[225:28] everybody will
[225:33] like I'm trying to remind stri business
[225:36] owners I don't receive those like
[225:38] invoices about generating invoice I
[225:40] don't receive emails about generating
[225:42] invoices every hours so it's not
[225:44] something that's necessarily fresh in my
[225:45] mind but if I see like an email pop up
[225:48] with a notification that says can you
[225:49] send me an invoice that might trigger
[225:51] some you know times where I was like
[225:53] browsing my emails and like the last
[225:55] thing I wanted to do was to actually
[225:56] send an
[225:58] invoice and so I think it's smart to
[226:00] have these little popup cells
[226:02] notifications whatever they're
[226:05] called and yeah we should be good so how
[226:08] does this guy okay
[226:18] how is he doing that is he calling it
[226:24] header did he put that notification
[226:26] ready
[226:38] okay
[227:02] [Music]
[227:07] how is it cutting that part
[227:54] all right I think it's time to
[227:57] code
[227:59] MH so what's the pricing like the
[228:02] pricing for now I set it up to a onetime
[228:06] payment and I think it's going to start
[228:08] at 49
[228:10] for the for the launch and probably 69
[228:13] after it's been
[228:18] released is react host yep just to
[228:21] changing the sty of I think so react H I
[228:24] think this is actually
[228:26] the react hot
[228:31] T but I am wondering if
[228:35] I
[228:38] oh
[228:40] well actually that's a good idea you're
[228:46] right yeah actually you're right man
[228:48] thanks W I was looking for another
[228:51] Library CU I have another another app
[228:54] that is a bit less useful but that is
[228:57] using this
[228:59] similar notification style it is quite
[229:02] nice I was thinking of downloading their
[229:05] package
[229:07] and cuz I really want to make to have a
[229:10] feeling
[229:12] of I don't know if react hot dust is
[229:15] actually the one to
[229:16] go I want to have this like really pop
[229:19] up from the right
[229:29] side is this a lifetime payment yes it
[229:32] will be a lifetime
[229:38] payments
[229:42] let's go to The Lending page
[229:48] um I think the demo is very important so
[229:50] I'm going to spend some time on the
[229:52] those
[229:55] notifications and then writing the copy
[229:57] after will be a bit shorter
[230:01] so which Library am I going to use
[230:04] figure that too there must be a
[230:06] direction property
[230:08] okay
[230:11] support
[230:17] API oh
[230:20] yep top
[230:24] right right menu yeah okay you're 100%
[230:38] right
[230:40] and that library is crazy it's a
[230:42] beautiful
[230:43] one okay
[230:49] so I think we're going to be sending
[230:51] probably like five
[230:53] notifications and then we're going to
[230:55] stop we don't want to have too many of
[230:57] [Music]
[231:02] them okay so we will need a normal
[231:05] component
[231:08] um
[231:11] theing
[231:12] [Music]
[231:36] [Music]
[231:38] notification
[231:54] um maybe I'll need a little bit of music
[232:00] if if you can hear the music please let
[232:03] me know because I think I'll be banned
[232:04] from YouTube If the music from my
[232:06] computer actually lends into your ears
[232:09] for copyright reasons so please let me
[232:11] know if you hear
[232:38] something
[233:07] see
[233:44] well actually I don't need any styling
[233:53] actually how do we make those toast
[233:55] toasted custom
[234:03] okay
[234:07] um
[234:09] is it going to play
[234:19] out so maybe anyway we're going to have
[234:21] a fixed
[234:23] uh messages I think it's going to be an
[234:26] ARA
[234:28] of uh can I have can
[234:32] I
[234:36] invoice invoice or or
[234:50] refill

[254:19] probably copy past a lot of code that I
[254:20] have for my other apps you're trying to
[254:22] mimic the iOS icon notification use the
[254:24] corner
[254:26] radius of 10 on the

[257:23] the
[257:23] exact
[257:25] reason the exact purpose of this
[257:35] thing
[257:38] I like it I think I'm creating a monster
[257:44] here I need to change the
[257:51] text it is super
[257:53] annoying mission mission

[259:12] [Music]
[259:35] a
[259:54] you might want to have this on the same
[259:56] line I
[260:01] guess trying some random stuff see if
[260:04] that
[260:05] works
[260:09] myself
[260:12] myself
[260:13] [Music]
[260:21] start I don't
[260:24] know I'm trying to add this like now
[260:29] stuff at the top at the very
[260:35] top
[260:42] actually yeah I'm just going to it him
[260:44] Center start
[260:48] okay looking good
[260:50] then all right so we have a little
[260:52] monster
[260:53] now maybe this needs to
[261:05] be yeah sounds like a notification game
[261:08] if you have us
[261:13] favor down swell is in six hours going
[261:17] to get some SL our down well is in six
[261:19] hours good night
[261:28] Sasha okay this is a very
[261:31] annoying I know this is
[261:35] good
[261:37] um now we need to rotate those
[261:42] invoices yeah I think I'm just going to
[261:44] take a random ones I don't need
[261:54] that oh wait actually no this is not fun
[261:57] if I'm I think I need to keep a
[262:01] backup I need to keep a backup of the
[262:03] notification have
[262:05] sent
[262:12] otherwise yes yes yes yes yes
[262:35] yes
[262:49] how do we keep
[263:05] the
[263:35] right
[263:37] still nuts what are you doing
[263:51] Mark oh yeah that's the react
[263:55] part
[264:05] um
[264:19] and
[264:35] message God damn it I don't know how to
[264:37] do that
[264:43] uh can I have an
[264:55] invoice oh
[264:59] boy my brain is entirely fried um if
[265:02] anyone knows I know I created some kind
[265:05] of Scopes where
[265:08] I'm trying
[265:09] to
[265:11] um basically
[265:13] send a new notification every
[265:18] second and for that I want to have some
[265:21] kind of like tracker so in toasted it's
[265:24] an array where I put all
[265:26] the messages that I've sent and I want
[265:29] to increase that number every time I
[265:32] send a toast I push set toasted and I
[265:35] add a new new to
[265:39] inside but there is some it keeps
[265:41] looping on the very
[265:43] first message of the
[265:51] arror and I know I've
[266:05] yeah
[266:10] what have I done
[266:17] um can you move your head if you can't
[266:18] see the
[266:21] code
[266:35] sure
[266:39] actually I don't know I think my head is
[266:40] actually moving with the
[266:50] camera to see what you guys see oh
[266:55] okay yeah my head is is moving with the
[267:00] camera I think the only option would be
[267:04] this
[267:36] your Loop is wrong you're not increasing
[267:37] the index to match the next item in okay
[267:41] so
[267:42] maybe poost maybe
[267:51] index
[267:54] um so here what we're going to
[267:58] do we're going to say message we're
[268:02] going to get the toast index we're going
[268:03] to toast it and we are going to
[268:07] say say toting
[268:11] de okay we increase toting de and here
[268:15] if toast index is inferior we send
[268:18] notification otherwise we clear the
[268:19] interval and we stop running
[268:22] okay is this going to work
[268:26] nope I don't know what I'm doing I think
[268:28] I'm just I'm
[268:34] actually
[268:41] I think it has to do with some scoping
[268:43] JavaScript
[268:45] scoping
[269:01] uh no
[269:04] maybe
[269:23] drink
[269:25] something and here we pass to index that
[269:28] I think should
[269:32] work hold on I think I'm tired
[269:37] this is not functional this person is
[269:38] not functional
[269:40] here oh yeah of course I don't increase
[269:42] the index
[269:44] yet yeah okay now that should
[269:49] work okay yeah this is
[269:53] working okay U probably we don't want to
[269:56] set a
[270:00] fixed oh
[270:03] man I am not fun
[270:07] today
[270:09] this we don't want to have this fixed
[270:12] but we might want to say something like
[270:14] full
[270:16] um with
[270:24] 60 we don't want to shrink this
[270:27] [Music]
[270:28] one you are a squer string
[270:33] maybe 16 so maybe that's a bit too small
[270:36] maybe we say 80 seems like a lot
[270:41] though it doesn't even exist no it yeah
[270:44] it does exist
[271:00] yeah okay I
[271:04] think
[271:34] okay
[271:53] let's say that little monster customer
[271:55] ad to my invoice okay okay okay this is
[271:58] so boring perfect maybe we give
[272:04] it
[272:22] we just want to send those maybe
[272:25] every 3 seconds so it's not too
[272:30] disturbing
[272:31] while we need
[272:34] to iCal German
[272:40] name
[272:42] Christian
[272:44] uh
[272:47] George jacob
[272:50] jacob

[273:11] very French name for that
[273:15] Pier
[273:17] Pierre Pier

[273:34] joke but I think this is
[273:36] f invoice are refund
[273:44] um
[273:49] Swiss Conrad elas yeah
[273:56] elas George invoice please
[273:59] customer
[274:01] um I'm we going to say
[274:04] this
[274:09] please cryp
[274:10] [Music]
[274:16] sh I don't
[274:18] know if uh anyone has a joke to make
[274:23] whatever this is about receiving
[274:25] invoices
[274:26] emails um please share it trying to had
[274:31] some fun stuff somewhere
[274:34] there
[274:50] yesterday least
[275:04] that
[275:31] uh we want to send the first
[275:32] notification early though so maybe what
[275:36] we can do
[275:42] is after
[275:46] four after 1
[275:51] second
[275:55] send
[276:03] notification oh maybe okay maybe
[276:13] I think I'm going to do this we're going
[276:15] to start at
[276:19] one and we're going to send the first
[276:23] notification within one
[276:27] second yeah so then we have something
[276:33] like uh why
[276:36] Double Y double why
[276:51] double where did they mess
[277:04] up
[277:07] can I have an
[277:17] invoice
[277:34] okay
[277:46] what MacBook do you
[277:53] use
[277:56] M2 a good question I think it's a
[278:01] M2 yeah
[278:02] M2 32 GB
[278:10] this is
[278:17] it set time mode should be set
[278:22] interval um let's see I
[278:25] think uh I think what I'm trying to do
[278:27] here is just first have a notification
[278:30] that arrives right after the page is uh
[278:35] served and then have an interval that
[278:38] starts at the second toast
[278:42] after because I don't want notifications
[278:44] to arrive too fast so 4 second is a nice
[278:47] sweet spot but I want the first
[278:49] notification to arrive at the first
[278:50] second does that make any
[278:54] sense yes
[278:57] sound sound will be good to know that
[278:59] notification has
[279:00] came you have a good sweet notification
[279:03] sound as is used by millions
[279:08] I I mean I wouldn't I'm not against
[279:10] sounds but I I just I'm just afraid some
[279:13] people might not like it and they'll be
[279:14] both bothered by it it's the only little
[279:22] thing should we push
[279:26] and add something that says oh I can
[279:29] click and remove them no I cannot
[279:30] something that says
[279:33] uh
[279:36] customer initiated a
[279:39] dispute just for
[279:47] fun or is it too much what do you guys
[279:53] think yeah but I think it's the time out
[279:56] that is sending two notifications I
[279:58] think it is gone now I think the timeout
[280:01] is I think it's because I was refreshing
[280:04] like saving the page and it didn't
[280:08] um yeah I think it it is gone
[280:17] here Shaman hello invoice
[280:22] please oh perfect mark would be even
[280:25] better to have a message icon and when
[280:26] you click on it you see all to have a
[280:29] message icon and when you click on it
[280:31] you see all the
[280:33] notification
[280:36] uh I'm not sure what you have in mind
[280:39] Zafar I think the idea here is to really
[280:42] replicate the moment where you start
[280:45] receiving um boring email
[280:50] notifications and so it has to be
[280:52] somehow a little bit intrusive in the
[280:54] experience that make any
[280:57] sense we want to keep them for maybe 20
[280:59] seconds just in case the person is not
[281:01] here oh maybe we don't want to Auto
[281:03] close
[281:12] oh maybe we want to close
[281:18] those react hot toast how to close the
[281:21] toast maybe we want to close the toast
[281:23] we don't want to close them until the
[281:25] user has actually finished
[281:29] scrolling as the the hero
[281:33] section am I overthinking
[281:47] probably oh we might want to add uh yeah
[281:50] CU on mobile devices it will be very
[281:53] boring so maybe we need to wrap
[282:02] the how do we keep track of how many
[282:04] have been sent and how do we close them
[282:08] okay to to
[282:12] to so we can to
[282:15] them your TOS success
[282:19] okay
[282:28] Advance
[282:32] okay so what we want to do here we want
[282:36] to have somewhere a
[282:48] little
[282:49] no it's going to be an empty
[282:52] array and I think I am going to store
[282:59] them same
[283:03] notification
[283:14] every time we send a notification we
[283:17] want to
[283:22] do to say
[283:24] [Music]
[283:27] toast toast ID is it yep and we want to
[283:32] push yes we want to push push those and
[283:35] so normally we have an
[283:39] array of
[283:44] toasts let's try
[283:48] again uh no okay I messed up use to
[283:55] ID supposed to be it's not supposed to
[283:57] be a string
[283:59] though
[284:01] oh wait
[284:03] what
[284:09] oh okay even simpler toast dismiss all
[284:12] right I think I'm I'm uh overthinking
[284:22] it remove
[284:24] toast without any emission okay an
[284:27] existing toast
[284:31] duplicate GFC contents this this library
[284:34] is super sick um I think on
[284:47] mobile I think on mobile device we don't
[284:50] want to have more than three toasts
[284:52] otherwise it's going to be a
[284:57] mess okay this is my mobile I refresh
[285:01] and I have those big toast right here
[285:08] yes we probably want to have only
[285:12] one so when it's this otherwise you're
[285:15] going to say with
[285:18] P
[285:20] okay this is a bit better
[285:33] uh
[285:38] and I don't know I'm going to trade
[285:39] something and say like
[285:43] if uh user
[285:47] is is on a mobile
[285:50] device and there are more than
[285:56] one toast remove the first one let's
[286:01] see to. links Superior one
[286:09] yeah except that you are not
[286:18] actually you are not actually checking
[286:21] the user on mobile
[286:33] device
[286:35] okay let's see what we get
[287:03] here
[287:06] if
[287:08] super so here R so if super or equal to
[287:17] one if it's if there's any one toast
[287:20] what we want to do is we
[287:24] want
[287:25] think
[287:30] dismiss all toast
[287:33] except the last
[287:39] one let's give it a little
[287:44] try
[287:48] nope oh oh okay because it takes some
[287:52] time is it yep okay yeah I need to
[287:55] remove

[288:02] yep one more
[288:05] try can I have an
[288:11] invoice okay it doesn't work it's
[288:16] broken oh
[288:27] maybe what is actually going on one
[288:33] toast
[288:44] can we try can we keep two
[288:46] toast actually don't know why
[289:00] but I think it's going to be annoying um
[289:06] [Music]
[289:08] remove wait wait wait wait wait
[289:26] um for
[289:32] each
[289:52] this Miss alls except the last
[290:02] one
[290:23] Mark is learning
[290:27] JavaScript yeah it sounds like you will
[290:28] be good you know notification
[290:32] came yeah but but I think it's a time
[290:34] out that s and
[290:54] effect okay now it's working for some
[290:57] reason is not
[291:01] instance but it does not matter
[291:19] okay one more time can I get any
[291:27] voice
[291:31] monster I to send this to my friend Nico
[291:34] I think you'll be proud of
[292:02] it
[292:06] what's going on
[292:32] here
[294:02] I
[294:32] okay
[294:56] window we can use the message icon it's
[295:01] pracy oh in Mobile you can say the
[295:03] message icon as I said per okay that
[295:05] makes sense
[295:06] now
[295:15] um sorry I'm I I had a very short night
[295:18] of sleep in um my brain is is not really
[295:20] working properly so I'm
[295:22] uh a little bit off the screen
[295:25] sometimes get the WID of the window Jak
[295:28] and ands
[295:31] from I think we're good I think we're
[295:33] good
[295:35] with the default notification system how
[295:37] it sets it's a bit annoying but not too
[295:40] much it
[295:46] is it is here is here good good good
[295:50] guess it's time to import
[295:53] some that
[295:55] boring notification so now we are going
[295:58] to play a little bit with ship
[296:02] Fest and
[296:11] cheaping start uping days not week okay
[296:13] we have that thing
[296:25] here I think we
[296:28] will probably copy some
[296:32] similar
[296:41] because if we have those
[296:43] notifications at the top right I think
[296:46] we should Center the
[296:48] content and I think that should be
[297:02] enough
[297:37] the check
[297:42] out
[297:50] okay let's do
[297:52] that image image image image
[297:56] image okay get in
[297:59] voice and we are going to remove that
[298:02] image let
[298:09] think should we or
[298:15] should I think there is no need for demo
[298:24] here there
[298:26] is eventually um there is maybe a
[298:30] way to do it like this
[298:34] that might be too
[298:41] much I think y I think I had a little
[298:44] bullet point like get a private link
[298:47] send to customers sell serve invoices
[298:50] and I think I don't need to have a
[298:53] demner the wife is
[299:02] back
[299:07] hello
[299:13] wife oh it's tving and hungry we have
[299:17] this
[299:19] thing we don't need to do
[299:23] that we don't need to do
[299:32] that
[299:44] we keep it
[299:49] neutral the Zeno icon is a bit
[300:01] big
[300:13] okay we're going to make it
[300:16] small white yeah because this is not
[300:19] very important okay Zen
[300:28] Bo we might want those notifications to
[300:30] go a little bit lower
[300:36] see if we can position them
[300:44] somewhere think
[300:52] it's get
[300:54] her I think it's in the layouts but we
[300:57] might want to use a different
[301:01] toaster
[301:06] toter
[301:14] yeah what if we have two
[301:18] toaster these components will run you
[301:21] can create your own duster with the
[301:22] Headless use duster oh maybe we can do
[301:26] that so we will
[301:31] have
[301:34] a headlight system that manage the
[301:36] notification state for
[301:40] you uh well actually I'm going to give
[301:42] it a try let's see if I import the
[301:50] toaster what options do we have
[301:53] there position top Center re order
[301:56] getter toast
[301:58] [Music]
[302:01] options
[302:07] because it's kind of
[302:31] overlapping
[302:40] all right it's
[303:01] TR
[303:31] okay I
[303:35] think think
[303:37] [Music]
[303:39] I'm
[304:01] Dam
[304:08] oh because I have two toasters now so I
[304:10] guess it's
[304:12] pushing double
[304:15] notifications I know I don't want to use
[304:21] the
[304:31] oh
[304:38] can you just add some pening to The
[304:40] Container
[304:41] yes
[304:47] um Yes actually I could yeah yeah I
[304:50] think that's the probably the smartest
[304:52] yeah instead of
[304:54] yeah and thanks I think brain is too fry
[304:58] to think properly right now con time
[305:14] container container class name probably
[305:16] want to use
[305:19] that
[305:24] um see if I do a heading 32 just to
[305:31] see this is
[306:01] working is there anything that was added
[306:04] to the container let's
[306:09] see class p32 or maybe just p32 doesn't
[306:13] exist who
[306:15] knows yes probably p32 doesn't
[306:19] exist oh no maybe it does p24
[306:31] maybe
[306:37] I'm going to stick with
[306:39] the
[306:50] side oh cust the can be used to
[306:53] change what should I give
[306:56] it all right there we
[307:01] go
[307:11] or maybe
[307:13] [Music]
[307:24] three think the position is
[307:27] nice we probably want to reduce a little
[307:30] bit the header size
[307:37] with
[307:39] [Music]
[307:47] um in the right hit hit hit
[308:01] hitter
[308:03] pricing uh reviews probably pricing
[308:05] probably F
[308:07] IQ
[308:11] proba okay it's working it's working
[308:13] it's working I get a voice okay I think
[308:16] this is
[308:18] good I'll be running the stream for five
[308:20] more minutes I guess before I pass
[308:23] out the hero
[308:25] section we don't have the product tant
[308:29] badge can remove it and we are going to
[308:31] see what we wrote with Nico stop wasting
[308:34] hours focus on your startup not the
[308:38] invoices I think I like this
[308:46] one uh baby H2
[308:49] then see s invoices for your customers
[308:52] and let your customers find edit and
[308:55] download their STP in so you don't have
[309:00] to how El five
[309:04] Flex LG Flex row
[309:07] nope by
[309:12] Center it starts
[309:14] [Music]
[309:19] no I think that should be
[309:23] better and we can remove the ugly button
[309:28] right
[309:31] there
[309:43] focus on your startup not the
[309:45] invoices you might want to
[309:49] have contents break
[309:52] here it's probably going to be 7
[310:01] XL
[310:09] I
[310:10] think with LG MX
[310:13] [Music]
[310:17] AO t
[310:20] space
[310:22] contents
[310:28] secondary that's better get Sy probably
[310:32] this should be
[310:34] a extra
[310:37] style probably a button wide I
[310:44] think did I call
[311:00] that
[311:18] and we are going to give a CP button
[311:23] wide focus on your startup not the
[311:28] invoices I see
[311:30] fq
[311:35] maybe this is too big we want to give it
[311:38] MD I think I don't like the H2 and
[311:41] instead I'll probably do something like
[311:44] this uh I think bu
[311:47] disputes old part should
[311:50] work um let me hide my screen for one
[311:53] second just to make sure I don't lick
[311:56] all my environment
[311:58] variables
[312:00] and
[312:04] okay
[312:05] no there how do you drive traffic if you
[312:09] get started from zero all over again oh
[312:12]  all right it's a good question um
[312:13] well I finished the stream and I'll
[312:15] answer that
[312:24] question that is the part we want this
[312:28] thing
[312:30] um
[312:33] then t space cont secondary leing relax
[312:38] okay minute good set up text I think
[312:41] we're going to say secondary
[312:46] maybe look
[312:49] now I think I set up something
[312:53] no isn't it oh accent okay Tes
[312:59] accit unfortunately no I'm good so we're
[313:02] going to stick to the
[313:07] primary we also going to remove ping to
[313:15] for
[313:17] we we
[313:30] we
[314:14] um how is
[314:16] it not
[314:28] bad generate maybe let your customer
[314:31] generates
[314:34] and download stripe invoices
[314:38] stri so you don't have
[314:48] to reduce
[315:00] customer
[315:05] okay that's a unique kind of a page I
[315:08] think because my screen is quite big
[315:10] that would more look like
[315:15] this which I think it looks
[315:18] cool you arrive here and you see those
[315:21] annoying customers can I have an
[315:28] invoice oh my God if there is any french
[315:30] person in the chat let me know how how
[315:32] stupid that joke
[315:34] is oh
[315:36] man focus on
[315:39] start okay I'm start up not the
[315:44] invoices let your customer generate and
[315:46] don't describe invoices so you don't
[315:47] have to C in just one minute I think I'm
[315:49] going to probably rewrite a little bit
[315:51] of the copy
[315:52] later they probably ready to go for now
[315:55] if I make a smaller headline how would
[315:57] that
[315:58] look yeah maybe that's more reasonable
[316:00] yeah it
[316:05] is um I think I can keep
[316:14] that one minute no so what do we have we
[316:17] have 1 minute no code
[316:21] setup what are the benefits the three
[316:23] benefits it's
[316:25] fast it's very fast super easy to make
[316:28] so one minute no code setup we can keep
[316:30] that
[316:34] it
[316:34] is somehow safe secure
[316:44] um I think reduce
[316:47] customer okay I think I can say reduce
[316:50] customer
[317:00] support
[317:18] and this is good
[317:22] um look good set
[317:25] up reduce customer
[317:30] support
[317:57] create
[317:58] portal
[318:00] um
[318:27] I think I think I will just remove that
[318:30] part and if the user is not logged in
[318:33] I'm not going to display anything
[318:35] probably yeah the
[318:44] point customer can voice
[318:57] refound on your startup not invoice let
[319:00] your customer generates
[319:01] let your customers generate in one
[319:03] minute nood
[319:04] [Music]
[319:07] setup I think I'll need to think F
[319:10] tomorrow reduce customer
[319:14] support oh maybe one minut
[319:20] no let's this uh what is it it's in the
[319:23] hero section
[319:30] here
[319:32] invoice
[319:35] right for
[319:43] Europe especially for sending up
[319:45] invoices in
[320:00] Europe
[320:16] PL okay my brain is totally fried no
[320:19] more uh
[320:20] energy I think I'm going to push this we
[320:23] have a little
[320:24] something going to say a little
[320:26] something
[320:27] here all right um save tra oh actually
[320:32] oh man a dude I almost missed that
[320:35] message thanks actually
[320:38] save and a this is dope save stripe
[320:42] invoice
[320:50] Fe wait uh how does it look
[320:56] now I think we can actually
[321:00] 0.4%
[321:01] I mean it's not doesn't sound big like
[321:05] this maybe we don't need to display it
[321:07] maybe we'll show later one minute no
[321:10] good
[321:12] setup
[321:14] um here save stripe invoice same St
[321:18] invoice fee one minute no setup reduce
[321:21] customer
[321:29] support see ronic oh wow stotonic well
[321:33] the H Ling page is already
[321:35] done with what is a search key shortcuts
[321:39] in vs code to search files uh for on my
[321:42] computer it's set up for command plus T
[321:46] yes is it it
[321:48] is instead of stripe you could place a
[321:50] stripe
[321:52] logo all right you guys are uh keeping
[321:55] me
[321:56] alive um how would I add the stripe logo
[322:00] here though
[322:01] I think this is really right I the
[322:03] stripe logo logo needs to be somewhere I
[322:05] don't know where it
[322:11] is maybe maybe it should be there in the
[322:14] notification a notification that pops up
[322:16] that say dispute dispute initiated
[322:18] reason
[322:20] no okay no this is dope all right I
[322:23] thought it would be a little bit too
[322:24] much but no this is actually a really
[322:25] good
[322:29] idea okay
[322:33] I'm going to push
[322:35] the this is how I'm going to stay alive
[322:37] for the few more minutes
[322:38] [Music]
[322:43] um strip and which
[322:48] this yes and here in the annoying
[322:53] invoices invoice or refone I think here
[322:55] we're going to say something
[322:59] like now
[323:05] right
[323:06] ref refound
[323:09] inated
[323:10] initiated is it how it's written I don't
[323:14] know initi I think it is yeah
[323:19] um no
[323:23] invoice what I
[323:25] did and we going to say that it's type
[323:30] icon
[323:33] l
[323:37] or stripe
[323:39] image we going say the icon is stripe
[323:42] image and
[323:43] here we are going to say that it's going
[323:46] to be message
[323:48] do icone or the Gmail image this is a
[323:53] bit dirty but this is functional let's
[323:56] see how that
[323:59] works get an
[324:02] invoice and my to invoice
[324:05] please invoice or
[324:09] refund refund initiated reason no sir
[324:13] okay I like
[324:19] that this is good maybe I need to find
[324:23] the right stripe logo though probably
[324:26] this one
[324:29] um
[324:39] I'll just put it at the beginning just
[324:40] to
[324:46] see uh yeah we might want to have the
[324:48] full stripe logo cuz here it doesn't
[324:50] look like that logo so I'm going to have
[324:53] to touch a little bit of the
[324:57] code right I think what I'm going to do
[324:59] is this I'm going to say
[325:01] okay
[325:03] um instead I'm going to say type equal
[325:11] stripe and here we're going to
[325:13] do message. type equals
[325:16] strip and this
[325:20] or
[325:24] that is it am I messing up my code here
[325:27] no Maybe not maybe yes let's see
[325:33] I think here we're going to copy that
[325:36] and we are not going to have a pading
[325:39] which is going to have rounded 10 pixel
[325:41] to be
[325:43] sure stripe
[325:46] image all right let's see how that
[325:51] goes yeah of course I'm not using the
[325:54] right logo and it should actually be
[325:59] bigger
[326:02] yes that's
[326:04] me
[326:07] save try
[326:10] GS
[326:11] replace here we are going to do
[326:14] something like we need to add the
[326:16] petting it's
[326:18] not super clean but it's going to work
[326:21] we need to add four pixels to each so
[326:25] probably
[326:29] 10 oops
[326:35] 40 32 I think that should be working um
[326:39] withth
[326:40] 40 he 40 and
[326:45] here okay let's
[326:49] see okay we have a little
[326:52] mistake some
[326:58] place okay
[327:01] this is
[327:03] good I
[327:06] think or
[327:10] probably maybe I can do something better
[327:12] I can
[327:20] do
[327:24]  done
[327:29] here
[327:42] give me the X
[327:44] color all right this is
[327:47] this so we can do
[327:51] instead do
[327:57] that round it
[328:04] how does it look
[328:11] now I messed
[328:18] up all right I think this is
[328:24] it
[328:29] excellent
[328:54] okay that's not
[328:55] my Prest work
[328:58] but the kind of
[329:07] now
[329:14] uh or
[329:22] G8 all right that should be better
[329:26] okay there we go region no Reon
[329:35] refil okay maybe we say just St
[329:38] [Music]
[329:58] refound okay maybe we going to push this
[330:00] a little
[330:08] bit there we go reason no invoice

[330:27] you would see like oh can I have my

[333:38] Fest so when you download a logo or when
[333:41] you make one or download one or whatever
[333:44] Instagram you will be featured somewhere
[333:48] here a little library of
[333:51] logos this is pretty new but if you find
[333:54] yourself maybe whatever this is your
[333:56] build if you type something here you'll
[333:58] find it
[334:04] here anyway
[334:06] uman I kind of like the sleep better
[334:09] thing I think it's
[334:12] good man you're good you're really good
[334:14] at writing uh
[334:21] Cy racing reviews
[334:28] he
[334:47] okay I think that will be it for today
[334:52] I'm going to push
[334:55] that and actually the Zen voice is
[334:58] available and probably working out I
[335:01] think I found the little bug
[335:10] somewhere looks like it's because an
[335:13] image maybe
[335:19] here
[335:25] no and you think it is working focus and
[335:30] let your customer generate and no know
[335:32] their stripe
[335:33] invoices so you don't have to one minute
[335:36] not go set up
[335:42] um tripe invoice
[335:48] fee ruce customer
[335:52] support okay and I think at this point
[335:54] people might be a little bit curious how
[335:56] that works and then I will add a before
[335:59] and after or how it
[336:05] works all right all right I think yeah

[336:35] one with deploy fails hello what is my
[336:40] how do you know a deploy fail by the
[336:47] way did you find
