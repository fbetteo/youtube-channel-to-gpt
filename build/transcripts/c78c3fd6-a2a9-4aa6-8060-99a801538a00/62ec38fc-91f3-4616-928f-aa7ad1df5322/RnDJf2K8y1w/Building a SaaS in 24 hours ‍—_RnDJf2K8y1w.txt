[00:05] boom and we're live
[00:31] oh I think we're live
[00:35] you
[00:36] oh I think we're live oh
[00:40] yeah it's like dumb stuff
[00:42] to be like a
[00:46] wait give me I'm just sending up the
[00:48] links and the tweets making sure
[00:49] everything is working oh we're live on
[00:50] Twitch as well oh my God that's amazing
[00:53] all right let me share the
[00:55] SE in this
[00:59] ah so nice yo Andre James and the
[01:04] Twitter crew is here
[01:06] okay
[01:10] um let me know guys if you can hear me
[01:12] well
[01:13] is this the first one of the first
[01:15] stream I do so I have no idea if uh it's
[01:17] actually it will
[01:20] yeah yeah the video will stay on on
[01:23] YouTube
[01:26] ah lovely okay
[01:28] it would be cool if you guys can see the
[01:30] messages here normally it's supposed to
[01:31] work
[01:35] all right just one or two minutes of
[01:36] boring uh setup and then we should be
[01:39] good to go
[01:41] okay then it's
[01:42] work
[01:45] I think there is a way to embed the chat
[01:46] oh yeah there we go
[01:49] and I'm gonna check in obs
[01:52] actually I can show you the weird stuff
[01:55] I'm doing I'm I'm also learning because
[01:57] at the second time I use this software
[01:59] there should be a way to embed the chats
[02:02] so you guys can see each other's
[02:03] messages
[02:06] this is supposed to be the chat but it
[02:08] doesn't seem to be working
[02:12] uh
[02:14] doesn't look like it's working
[02:19] um
[02:31] all right I'm gonna give it another try
[02:37] um
[02:40] I'm using the OBS software that thing
[02:43] here
[02:44] I normally yeah we should we should see
[02:46] messages being shown
[02:49] from twitch and YouTube here
[02:52] but I think I got no luck in here
[02:57] anyway at least it's working let's share
[03:00] this on Twitter
[03:07] here we go
[03:14] all right now the chat is broken
[03:17] oh maybe because I froze the video
[03:22] I know it's still not working
[03:27] right
[03:33] you see that okay okay that's pretty
[03:34] cool uh
[03:36] do you see do you see your own messages
[03:38] because you're supposed to see messages
[03:40] from everyone watching the Stream
[03:43] if that's the case then we're good to go
[03:51] YouTube chat is working okay
[03:58] it's really oh yeah yeah you just see
[03:59] the chat is ready that's that's the same
[04:01] thing I see the chest is ready to
[04:02] display messages I have no idea what
[04:04] this is not working
[04:06] supposed to just pass this thing here
[04:07] and it's supposed to work maybe if I
[04:09] just give it a try
[04:11] oh yeah remove it
[04:16] and just add it again
[04:18] and I think it was brother or is it yeah
[04:21] it is here
[04:26] two
[04:34] the best another chat
[04:40] urge
[04:46] edit
[04:48] all right I'm gonna give this one last
[04:49] shot if it doesn't work we're just gonna
[04:51] move on
[04:54] let's see a little message sgpt
[04:58] what's up
[05:00] yo
[05:03] okay that sucks I don't even know how to
[05:05] get the chat here with you
[05:08] I can't even see messages
[05:17] [ __ ]
[05:18] okay that's it okay it doesn't seem to
[05:21] be working I I did my work yesterday I
[05:24] tried the chat and it was actually
[05:25] working
[05:27] and now it's not working anymore
[05:29] so
[05:32] yeah I want to refresh the cache and we
[05:35] move on up up uh so here we're launching
[05:40] boom We stream okay
[05:50] wow that's so cool like how many people
[05:52] how many makers are we here 24 watching
[05:54] ah nice okay
[05:55] super cool I admit they have some kind
[05:58] of pressure uh I never I did this once
[06:02] back in the time and we were like three
[06:04] in the chat
[06:05] and uh and yeah I usually build a load
[06:09] in my room and and like we're now on the
[06:11] internet with uh a bunch of Indie makers
[06:13] watching so um
[06:18] all right so I prepared a little thing
[06:21] here the purpose of this stream actually
[06:23] 24 hours I hope I can make it to 12
[06:25] hours is to build a e-learning platform
[06:29] for my wife
[06:31] um so let me explain that sounds strange
[06:33] she's a Korean teacher and she um she
[06:37] has students that she c101 and they want
[06:40] more Learning Materials so they need
[06:42] PDFs and stuff like this to practice and
[06:45] so
[06:46] um she would like to have a platform
[06:47] where students can subscribe login and
[06:50] subscribe and have a monthly membership
[06:52] priced to be around 49 a month
[06:55] and then
[06:56] um she as a teacher would log into the
[06:58] platform as a teacher and upload PDFs
[07:01] every week every two weeks whenever she
[07:02] wants and then her students who logged
[07:05] in a were actually paying Subs customers
[07:08] would receive an email and we'll be able
[07:10] to log in the platform download the PDF
[07:12] and do their exercise
[07:14] that's pretty much the gist of it
[07:16] um you can imagine it being a bigger
[07:19] platform you can imagine having I'm
[07:20] gonna build it only for my wife
[07:23] um but you can easily imagine that you
[07:25] would have multiple teachers and
[07:26] multiple students and we could just link
[07:28] students and teachers
[07:30] um so for the Simplicity of the stream
[07:31] I'm just going to make it for my wife
[07:32] because she's actually going to use it
[07:33] and so what we're going to cover we're
[07:35] going to build a landing page for her
[07:37] from scratch she sent me a few
[07:39] testimonials from our students but
[07:41] that's it pretty much
[07:43] um we're going to create a way for
[07:46] people to log in Access their accounts
[07:50] we're going to do the email setup to
[07:52] make sure that they receive their magic
[07:53] links to make sure that they receive the
[07:55] PDF when she broadcasts the the
[07:56] materials and we are going to have a
[08:00] dedicated account for her where she
[08:03] could actually upload PDF and send those
[08:06] PDF to her students so it's all supposed
[08:08] to be automated the ID is like students
[08:10] get a notification by email login access
[08:12] their materials and my wife just upload
[08:14] the PDF and the students gets theirs
[08:18] um so what we're going to do is this is
[08:20] totally unscripted I have not practiced
[08:23] at all so I have no idea where I'm going
[08:26] um I didn't write any code before so
[08:28] this is literally from scratch so I
[08:30] might make Bob's uh I might uh my head
[08:33] whatever uh so uh yeah this is like like
[08:36] a real use case plus the stress of the
[08:39] stream so that's another part
[08:42] um so we are going to use uh Tech stack
[08:45] with we're going to use next.js you can
[08:48] see here
[08:49] we're going to use Mel gun for sending
[08:51] emails whether it's magic links or the
[08:54] email that they will receive when they
[08:55] get the PDF to get notified we're going
[08:58] to use mongodb as a database and tell
[09:00] win CSS plus Daisy UI which I absolutely
[09:03] love it's a UI component Library
[09:06] um and so
[09:08] um obviously I created recently um a
[09:11] little nexjs boilerplate it's called
[09:13] cheapfest this is exactly what we're
[09:15] gonna we're gonna use these boilerplate
[09:17] to see how much it can improve and fast
[09:20] the the launch of this app
[09:22] so
[09:24] we are going to GitHub and get that repo
[09:27] and get started
[09:30] um that would be cool if I could see the
[09:32] chat messages
[09:33] just so you know have you guys inputs
[09:35] and uh
[09:37] and it'll be so nice
[09:39] if anyone knows how I can add the chat
[09:42] somewhere
[09:44] um in here
[09:45] that would be really helpful
[09:51] oh wait a little phone something oh I
[09:53] think I have it
[09:56] let's see if that works
[09:58] fingers crossed
[10:04] oh you guys are here oh I think it's
[10:07] gonna be working is it
[10:09] and now you see the message it's you
[10:12] Stephen nice
[10:14] seems like it's working
[10:16] okay
[10:18] cool so now I can I can uh I can
[10:21] actually
[10:22] I pull this away is it connected okay
[10:25] it's connected with
[10:28] oh it's on UBS so I cannot remove it and
[10:30] put it aside
[10:35] and it doesn't come with my
[10:40] and if I do something like
[10:43] I do something like this nah it
[10:44] disappears
[10:49] yep going to drink this the first time I
[10:52] tried twitch I use the restream so
[10:54] apparently I'm supposed to be streaming
[10:55] on both platforms uh totally new for me
[10:58] kind of fun all right so
[11:01] not perfect but I I can see your
[11:03] messages quite here it's really all
[11:05] right
[11:06] okay if I move on so I'm uh I'm more of
[11:09] a JavaScript person so I'm going to use
[11:11] the JavaScript repo and we're gonna get
[11:14] our hands on so
[11:15] um if you are tuning in right now and
[11:17] you want uh details of what we're gonna
[11:19] build under the the video uh you should
[11:23] have a description of what we're going
[11:24] to build how we're going to build it the
[11:26] text the text tag and why your wheel
[11:28] building is
[11:29] did it
[11:32] um yeah first of all we are so
[11:34] downloading the the we're going to clone
[11:36] that thing so that's the ship pass repo
[11:39] uh we're gonna clone it
[11:44] um
[11:45] and we're gonna call it uh so yeah my
[11:47] wife gave me a few guidelines the app
[11:49] should be called easy Korean
[11:51] that's what we're going to get started
[11:52] with
[11:56] and also feel free to let me know if uh
[11:58] I'm boring if the Sun is not good if
[12:00] there are things to change this is
[12:02] really one of the first stream I do so
[12:04] I'm really eager to hear your feedbacks
[12:06] uh if they're gone in the chat please
[12:08] send them on Twitter they'll be very
[12:10] helpful
[12:11] so we're cleaning the repo we get in
[12:13] there
[12:16] uh we're gonna run an MPL install
[12:22] gate
[12:25] we have yeah so we're gonna remove the
[12:27] remotes
[12:31] origin
[12:35] all right
[12:36] so there we have it um we're going to
[12:38] open our favorite text editor
[12:43] so for the little vs code and this is
[12:46] called easy Korean
[12:51] um
[12:52] here we go
[12:55] we're going to embed a little
[12:57] brother window and run the server
[13:02] I just might have to just kill my
[13:04] current development server there we go
[13:09] I like to have the brother on the right
[13:12] side and vs code on the left so I can
[13:14] code and see edits right away
[13:16] and now we're just going to run and can
[13:18] run Dev and we should be ready to go
[13:35] here we are
[13:37] that doesn't lag much for now but uh let
[13:40] me give you a quick uh
[13:42] idea of what we can do so
[13:46] once you have the sheepfest repo what
[13:48] you go what you do is you go over the
[13:49] config file here and these is basically
[13:51] the backbone of the app so everything
[13:53] that I'm going to be writing in here
[13:55] will basically impact every components
[13:56] and everything and we're going to have
[13:58] an app that's up and running real quick
[14:01] um
[14:02] it's going to call Easy Korean
[14:06] um what we're going to do is we are
[14:07] going first to make it
[14:10] uh
[14:11] look good for my wife she wants a
[14:15] colorful team so we're gonna use the
[14:17] Valentine theme
[14:20] [Music]
[14:20] um
[14:23] so Yep this is what we get with Daisy UI
[14:26] this is a UI component Library you get
[14:27] 20 plus themes they have a bunch of them
[14:29] they all look super cute I love this one
[14:32] uh I think it matched well with my wife
[14:34] and and her students so we're going to
[14:36] use the Valentine One what a romantic
[14:39] uh
[14:42] we're good
[14:43] um all right to make it less boring I'm
[14:46] going to on the page I'm going to show
[14:49] real quick what you have uh so you have
[14:52] some pre-made components
[14:54] with a ball of Blade that comes um
[14:57] we all need a header a pricing component
[14:59] a footer and all that
[15:02] so I'm going to add
[15:04] I'm going to add that to the page
[15:07] yes just just to give you a glimpse
[15:10] but you can get
[15:13] so we're gonna I think we're gonna
[15:15] remove that
[15:21] we're also going to remove that
[15:25] and we have the header
[15:28] GitHub Pilots for the win he knows
[15:31] give me the footer come on no you don't
[15:34] want okay
[15:36] all right so yeah obviously those is not
[15:39] the right copywriting we're going to
[15:41] rewrite this but um as a quick ID you
[15:44] get those components from the
[15:45] boilerplates and then you just import
[15:47] them and boom you have a responsive app
[15:50] that looks good you just have to write
[15:51] your copy and then you can edit whatever
[15:53] you want the buttons the text the
[15:55] layouts that's all up to you but it
[15:56] gives you a framework on how to set up
[15:59] your landing page
[16:02] uh it looks like this on
[16:04] desktop
[16:08] all right there's a lot of things we
[16:10] have to do
[16:12] um we have two IO domain find the phones
[16:17] make the landing page
[16:20] what else I remember the phone and set
[16:23] up all the libraries for login and all
[16:25] that
[16:28] [Music]
[16:29] um
[16:31] and then yeah build a user dashboard
[16:37] uh
[16:40] yep yep yeah
[16:43] all right we're gonna we're gonna start
[16:44] with um
[16:49] I just think I'm uh I'm doing it well
[16:52] okay cool
[16:56] you can see the demo the chat erase too
[16:57] big okay
[16:59] let me change that
[17:01] uh what if I put it in
[17:09] yeah okay I think I will disable that
[17:11] what if I make it super small
[17:16] I do something like this
[17:21] bottom right
[17:25] that could be I think the right part is
[17:27] actually the one where I I'm gonna be
[17:29] building so maybe it's best on the left
[17:31] for you
[17:32] the video
[17:39] all right I think we're going to spend
[17:41] most of the time on this screen
[17:43] let me know if you guys can see the gist
[17:46] of it like the most important parts so
[17:48] the the editor here maybe I can just
[17:50] zoom
[17:51] I'll be better
[17:55] all right so if you if you guys can see
[17:57] from this and this on the right it
[18:00] should be good if not I'll just remove
[18:02] the chat
[18:04] foreign
[18:11] okay
[18:15] a bit smoother
[18:17] the chat a bit smaller
[18:22] okay
[18:27] I don't know I don't even know if this
[18:28] is if can you guys still read the chat
[18:31] because at some point if you know it's
[18:33] too annoying I'm just gonna remove it
[18:37] yeah I wish I knew how to do that
[18:40] the thing is uh
[18:42] yeah it's yeah I'm not I'm not the Savvy
[18:45] OBS user removes better okay
[18:48] let's remove it
[18:51] no more chats
[18:58] okay this is it I'm gonna pull the
[19:00] credit card give me one second because
[19:02] we're gonna have to buy a domain name
[19:12] that's the rubber stream
[19:15] credit card
[19:19] okay
[19:24] let's head to namecheap and
[19:28] log into that thing
[19:31] before I just mess up my whole life give
[19:34] me a second I just check my password is
[19:36] not available
[20:01] all right we're back
[20:05] okay
[20:07] um
[20:08] we are going to buy a domain so the name
[20:12] of the
[20:13] maybe I should write it down here
[20:15] we do what we do most of the conscience
[20:17] but
[20:19] it is easy Korean
[20:27] so we're going to search something like
[20:28] easy Korean
[20:30] it's never going to be able we're never
[20:32] going to find a.com name for sure but
[20:35] yeah of course
[20:37] what do we have here
[20:39] is he Korean easy Korean
[20:42] oh is he korean.co is available
[20:47] that could be the Korean easy Maybe
[20:51] no this looks weird
[20:54] is he Korean that cool
[20:58] got it that's a that's a goal
[21:03] you coming here go check out
[21:06] we're shopping domain names today wow
[21:09] nice Saturday back to school confirmware
[21:14] yep
[21:21] oh this is smart I bet I'll pay
[21:24] something like 13x to price the next
[21:26] year
[21:34] yep
[21:42] this stream is uh the least privacy
[21:45] thing you can expect credit cards
[21:47] classes and all that it's all available
[21:49] here
[21:54] okay we have it
[22:01] okay we're gonna set up the DNS
[22:03] um
[22:05] so there is also a
[22:09] tutorial on
[22:12] on cheap basketball plates that you can
[22:15] uh you can use it it tells you exactly
[22:19] what you have to do in order to set up
[22:22] your app so
[22:23] um this is the tutorial part of ship
[22:25] fast so I'm just gonna be following
[22:28] these for a little while
[22:29] um now we're setting up the domain name
[22:31] and the emails things
[22:33] um so I'm gonna have to set up million
[22:35] so this is exactly what I'm gonna have
[22:37] to do
[22:39] um so first maybe we deploy it yeah
[22:41] we'll deploy it inversal that'll be cool
[22:44] we're gonna say it's a first commit
[22:48] easy Korean private repo
[22:52] and then we're gonna go to Virtual
[22:55] um which which is where I host all my
[22:57] projects and this one will be one of
[22:58] them too
[23:03] yep okay
[23:05] a new project
[23:10] easy Korean
[23:16] yeah oh maybe you'll have a
[23:19] ID plug without the config variables
[23:21] maybe there will be an issue or
[23:22] something we'll see
[23:26] let me check there is nothing that is
[23:27] weird on the screen
[23:41] oh so the name chip renewal is a common
[23:44] thing apparently

[24:09] do we have any bug no we don't have any
[24:12] bug we're good to go

[24:18] simple app
[24:20] that is being deployed
[24:25] I'm just going to be I'm going to be
[24:26] sharing the link so if I don't know if
[24:28] you guys want to play around with it for
[24:30] now it's going to look like not much

[24:44] oh no I have to choose a thing
[24:48] damn it I cannot copy the copy past the
[24:49] link
[24:55] okay well anyway I'll find a way oh
[24:57] maybe I can do it here
[25:06] okay
[25:07] let's send it here
[25:09] we're going to do the same I have no
[25:11] idea how to share something on Twitch
[25:13] I don't know if I can
[25:15] error messages
[25:17] all right no I get it anyway let's move
[25:20] on
[25:21] um so we have the app ready we are going
[25:22] now to connect to the simple virtual
[25:24] connection
[25:26] um with the just set up the domain name
[25:29] uh we're gonna add easy
[25:32] very end of code
[25:37] and we're going to do that what I'm
[25:40] going to do also I'm going to write it
[25:41] down on the code it's going to be here
[25:48] hello the configuration time
[25:50] um chip is here
[25:55] okay
[25:56] 1C name www
[26:04] right and we have
[26:06] these
[26:08] for an a record
[26:18] we're gonna wait a bit that should be
[26:19] working
[26:20] um
[26:22] yeah while we're waiting for this I'm
[26:23] gonna
[26:25] what I'm going to do is a good question
[26:29] yeah we're not going to have crisp so we
[26:31] don't care this is when you set up the
[26:32] customer search report for stripe she is
[26:35] going to have two plans so we can keep
[26:37] both
[26:39] um so yeah this cool thing as well is
[26:41] here you can import pricing components
[26:47] and
[26:49] and you have a pricing section here
[26:51] that's connected
[26:54] um
[26:55] to stripe so normally we have an API
[26:57] route
[26:58] uh yeah I think I need to set up the
[27:00] plans on stripe I have to open a stripe
[27:02] account but yeah
[27:03] you would have this would be connected I
[27:05] need to finish the configuration file
[27:06] here but this would be connected with
[27:08] stripe and we can just open and check
[27:09] out just like this
[27:11] um AWS we don't care
[27:14] we are going to have here
[27:20] will be
[27:22] no reply to easy Korean
[27:25] so this is this is a few big things that
[27:28] I have to do uh to make sure that works
[27:30] when we send emails for instance so this
[27:33] is going to be 1G my wife's name is 1g
[27:35] at easy Korean
[27:40] yeah probably not mark
[27:44] um Market shifter so same
[27:49] Ng
[27:51] easy credit go
[27:53] and we're going to forward
[27:56] um emails so for the melga part the male
[28:00] gun part to we can imagine can send
[28:03] emails but cannot receive them and send
[28:05] it to your email right away you have to
[28:08] forward them so there is a Web book that
[28:09] you listen to that's already included in
[28:11] the boilerplate and that's just going to
[28:13] send those received email through the
[28:16] webbook to my wife's personal email if
[28:19] she ever let's say someone reply to one
[28:22] of the emails she's going to send with a
[28:25] PDF the email the reply will go through
[28:28] melgen servers forward the email to our
[28:31] virtual hosting deployments and then
[28:33] that will send the email to my wife
[28:37] wpwgh okay that's the very hard to
[28:41] understand email but that should be it
[28:44] by kernel dashboard okay I think we're
[28:46] good to go with the config it's gonna
[28:48] need to set up the plans subscribe let's
[28:50] see versal in the meantime
[28:57] making sure I did the right thing here
[29:01] yep
[29:03] I'll give it a little try
[29:10] um yeah let's set up so yeah I'm just
[29:13] now I'm just going to be moving on step
[29:14] by step doing each Library so the first
[29:18] one is the email so I'm gonna go to
[29:20] melgon and just follow what it says
[29:26] shouldn't have to pay anything else I
[29:27] just I can put the credit card back
[29:37] okay so the yeah okay my lugs
[29:39] okay my lugs are hidden by default so I
[29:42] think I'm safe to keep sharing my screen
[29:45] when I'm logging into every platform
[29:46] every time I'm logging in I'm like a
[29:48] little sweat dropping and oh
[29:51] um okay this is melgan uh so here it
[29:55] tells exactly what I have to do so
[29:57] sending click domains and add your node
[29:59] I mean new domain
[30:03] um yeah that's something uh that's
[30:06] something that's being talked about uh
[30:08] it's hard to know
[30:12] how well it would work or not but
[30:13] usually you would typically you would
[30:15] add a subdomain like email dots you know
[30:19] what I mean
[30:20] um I call it mg for melgen
[30:24] some people say it doesn't really matter
[30:26] to just keep your domain name I'd like
[30:28] to add a subdomain because that's what
[30:29] mail will recommend
[30:31] so this is what I'm going to do
[30:34] adding the domain
[30:37] I'm just checking from time to time that
[30:39] yeah we're still live okay
[30:45] oh uh the next JS app is a page router
[30:50] I'm still using this one I'm planning to
[30:52] migrate to the router thing uh when I
[30:55] get my hands a bit more in it
[31:05] yeah
[31:08] there's a TS also there's a typescript
[31:10] version of it I'm using the JavaScript
[31:12] one because that's what I prefer there
[31:14] are two versions that you can get both
[31:18] um okay so we're going to play again
[31:19] with
[31:20] um
[31:21] domain name DNS records as well
[31:25] so here
[31:26] we are going to add what was that mg
[31:30] text oh yeah text record
[31:36] and recognize that uh
[31:39] and then this one
[31:41] yeah because if you're using melgan this
[31:44] is a bit confusing copy just the thing
[31:46] that's before your mail getting domain
[31:49] so mg that's your domain name
[31:51] I got trapped multiple times and ended
[31:54] up like having the wrong records
[31:56] that's DK
[32:01] so yeah here I'm supposed to pass only
[32:03] that thing
[32:04] before mg no no
[32:10] UI at its best
[32:12] get away
[32:16] if I assume it works
[32:25] okay uh what else do we have MX records
[32:29] it makes BMX a
[32:37] is it
[32:44] where are those little records
[32:51] maybe they're here
[32:55] oh yeah I think they're here okay
[33:02] 10.
[33:07] uh you don't want to add another one
[33:24] we see live melgan is showing me signs
[33:27] that it's something weird
[33:30] I'll be working alongside the night hey
[33:31] Andre
[33:33] we're gonna where are you working on
[33:50] the stream crashed God damn it
[33:54] no we're still here
[33:59] we're still there it was still there
[34:01] yeah
[34:03] okay okay maybe just the okay we're
[34:06] still there
[34:10] it makes me
[34:16] okay
[34:19] um and we're not going to track anything
[34:23] so we don't need to set this up
[34:27] [Music]
[34:28] and we're gonna very try to verify this
[34:32] those are verified these are not yet
[34:34] verified about The Versatile ones
[34:38] okay it's verified on versal so easy
[34:40] korean.co is the domain name here we go
[34:49] yeah just checking melgan this is what
[34:51] we're supposed to okay we're gonna move
[34:52] on with the next extra record so
[34:54] according to my experience adding the
[34:58] mil gun configuration is not enough so I
[35:01] usually I add a few more so I add a
[35:04] dmarc for better deliverability
[35:07] I'm going to copy this one a text record
[35:11] this DeMark
[35:14] domain.com so I'm going to do this
[35:20] same uh mg
[35:23] oh yeah
[35:27] oh yeah I think I've messed up here
[35:32] I might have messed up this thing yeah
[35:39] just to be sure
[35:42] I'm going to check what I did for
[35:43] another domain name
[35:46] and let's check this one
[35:48] making sure that I don't uh
[35:53] I don't have the wrong records
[35:56] it's the which one was that a text
[35:59] record
[36:00] pf1
[36:04] these are nuts
[36:06] oh yeah okay they're here
[36:08] mg okay okay yeah so yeah that's the
[36:11] right thing here here I forgot to add
[36:13] that thing
[36:16] uh text record what was it
[36:19] please record
[36:23] mg
[36:24] and we are going to add this demarc
[36:31] and then
[36:34] uh make sure that's the right thing
[36:37] Mark mg that's your Dominion okay that's
[36:39] the right
[36:41] okay and moving on we are going to
[36:43] domain setting and get the credential
[36:45] okay
[36:49] let's check one more time
[36:54] celebration all green we're ready to
[36:57] move on
[37:00] um
[37:04] the main settings SMTP credential
[37:06] automatic
[37:08] it is
[37:13] oh here
[37:15] MTP credentials oh just a check here
[37:17] everything's fine yep no tracking we
[37:19] don't need to track anything in here
[37:22] and SMTP credentials
[37:25] I started give me one second I'm going
[37:27] to copy those
[37:30] um so I need I need to rename that thing
[37:32] to local
[37:34] and here is this basically where I'm
[37:36] going to put all the keys I'm going to
[37:38] be using I think
[37:39] we're going to keep this we're going to
[37:41] keep the million API email server Google
[37:44] yeah we're going to keep all those
[37:47] let me let me show you my stupid face
[37:49] for one second
[37:53] yep oh now the chat is displayed big
[37:56] here and small there
[37:59] all right that's cool that's pretty cool
[38:05] okay once I go on setting up the API
[38:07] keys
[38:08] [Music]
[38:16] mill again
[38:18] we are here
[38:27] okay I just added the API key to the
[38:30] environment variable
[38:33] in setting API key wait sending key
[38:47] oh yeah I need so there are two things
[38:49] yeah I'm using SMTP and the API key from
[38:52] melgen I'm gonna have to set up both I
[38:54] just set up one for now give me one
[38:55] second
[38:57] [Music]
[38:58] um
[38:58] that's the postmaster thing
[39:08] I'll get you here up
[39:24] okay
[39:30] um SMTP is here it's easy Korean
[39:38] that code
[39:41] and I need
[39:43] I need I need I need the sending API key
[39:45] as well
[39:47] at sending key
[39:50] so
[40:00] be good to go in a minute
[40:02] and girl easy korean.com and fisting
[40:06] okay
[40:12] there you go welcome back
[40:15] yo Alexandra Alexandra
[40:19] um we've set up the melgan API keys
[40:22] we're able to send emails if I'm not
[40:25] mistaken
[40:26] um if you do don't need to receive
[40:28] emails
[40:31] yeah I don't think we're gonna set this
[40:32] up
[40:34] yeah
[40:36] yeah I'm gonna skip that part the part
[40:38] where you actually receive emails from
[40:41] mail gun so if people reply to the
[40:44] emails you send with melgan they are
[40:46] normally lost melgan doesn't uh I mean
[40:48] you can't store them I think they have a
[40:50] higher plan or something but normally
[40:51] their loss so in that specific case I
[40:54] will not set them up because we don't
[40:55] need to
[40:58] um
[41:00] yeah
[41:03] yeah so I think we should be good to go
[41:04] with melgon thing
[41:07] um
[41:08] or we can actually give it a try hey
[41:10] let's see how that goes
[41:13] um going back so yeah I need to check if
[41:16] next oh oh before we set up oh yeah I
[41:18] need to add
[41:20] I need to set up the database because
[41:23] otherwise
[41:25] otherwise we cannot store the tokens for
[41:27] the login thing so one more thing one
[41:30] more time I just gonna add the
[41:32] environment variable the mongodb uh Euro
[41:35] URL string
[41:37] to the to the local to the local
[41:40] environment variables so it's here
[41:48] easy Korean
[41:52] and then mongodb
[41:59] okay
[42:01] we're back
[42:03] um
[42:06] so yeah I just added that uh environment
[42:10] variable to connect to the local it's a
[42:13] local database I run uh this is nice for
[42:16] to present first it doesn't uh take time
[42:18] like calls our instance and also if you
[42:22] are in a plane or if you are in a train
[42:24] or something where the Wi-Fi is really
[42:25] bad you can still work because your
[42:28] calls to check if the user is logged in
[42:30] or not to the database then it's it's
[42:31] instant because it's running locally and
[42:34] I would just change the the variable
[42:36] when I run on the virtual deployment
[42:40] uh so now we are supposed to be good
[42:43] let's see
[42:45] oh no there's another sorry it's
[42:47] important part it's the it's the
[42:49] environment uh verbal thing I have to
[42:51] set up so I have to go again and add
[42:54] some more uh the ones we use for next
[42:57] oath the library used to authenticate
[42:59] users I'm going to set it up it's gonna
[43:01] take a minute
[43:03] uh
[43:05] and then I think that's the last one
[43:08] we need for now
[43:12] okay yeah
[43:18] if I if I [ __ ] up and I just show my all
[43:22] my environment variables
[43:24] I'm gonna have some work
[43:27] um
[43:28] okay it's here so this is next also it's
[43:30] a it's a popular library for next years
[43:35] and we're going to be using that thing
[43:37] to login users
[43:38] so
[43:40] let's back to it
[43:42] um this should be working so if I go to
[43:44] the
[43:46] I'm gonna open I'm gonna use the hero
[43:49] here that Euro components I'm gonna
[43:50] remove because she's not on product hunt
[43:52] she's a teacher uh
[43:55] a Korean made easy
[43:59] I hope we had a little flag
[44:02] um we're gonna have to finish this later
[44:04] copywriting and stuff we're gonna we're
[44:06] gonna go into copywriting thing I'm far
[44:08] from being an expert but uh we can do
[44:11] this together
[44:12] we are also gonna say like a master like
[44:17] Master Korean now
[44:23] okay
[44:25] um and then the button we're gonna say
[44:27] that's
[44:29] on click
[44:34] and assign in the user okay
[44:37] and so I think if I'm not mistaken that
[44:43] we are we have everything
[44:46] let's see
[44:47] okay the Google login
[44:49] um will not work
[44:53] is what just one second I'm just
[44:55] checking what's the call where the color
[44:58] is wrong oh yeah okay that's here
[45:00] Valentine
[45:03] so normally it should stay in the theme
[45:05] okay there we go we stay in the theme
[45:08] um everywhere so user is not confused
[45:12] emails should be working let's give it a
[45:15] try
[45:17] the email cannot be sent okay it is not
[45:19] maybe it's not configured yet
[45:22] authentication failed
[45:26] some bugs enter the room
[45:34] oh yeah maybe that doesn't help
[45:38] authentication failed so I guess that's
[45:41] one of the SMTP keys that are not
[45:43] working well
[45:45] one second I'm checking the keys to show
[45:47] my stupid face one more time
[45:55] email server easykorean.com
[46:13] easycareer.com
[46:25] getting back to Amelia and checking more
[46:27] keys
[46:35] the key idea
[46:48] last semester
[46:57] that is here
[47:14] I'm gonna work okay it's working I don't
[47:16] know what I did but it's working I think
[47:19] I just copy the wrong keys let me show
[47:21] you my screen again
[47:25] what side do you recommend to create
[47:27] logos that's a good point
[47:29] um well so now you know me from Twitter
[47:32] I'm a very uh
[47:34] trade to the point person so what I
[47:37] would do is I would use
[47:40] either hero Icons copy one icon that you
[47:43] like anything that's representing your
[47:45] app so my wife is learning Korean so
[47:47] that could be
[47:49] um
[47:49] Chinese whatever
[47:51] Asian language maybe yeah you could use
[47:54] that thing here and copy it go to figma
[48:00] and
[48:01] yep that's how I made my logo this for a
[48:04] website this is an hero icon so free
[48:07] open source here you go here and then
[48:11] you just add a fancy gradient thing and
[48:13] boom you have a logo that looks okay
[48:16] um another one is to find I think linear
[48:19] icons
[48:22] uh is that the one maybe not
[48:27] uh yeah I think that's the one uh
[48:30] I forgot I think lineal colors
[48:33] you say cute plants for instance
[48:36] yeah this here we go so I have I don't
[48:39] know why but I feel like the linal color
[48:40] thing it looks like a logos for some
[48:43] reason that could be the logo for a
[48:44] habit tracker that's how I did the logo
[48:47] for habits Garden actually one of my
[48:49] first app it's here
[48:52] um you can find a bunch of stuff here I
[48:54] think you have to credit the owner or
[48:56] something
[48:57] um read the oh this is my app logo what
[49:00] a surprise
[49:02] um yeah there's another way another way
[49:03] to find Logos uh and then otherwise
[49:07] um
[49:08] yeah there are some libraries like let
[49:10] me see I think next time I would use
[49:12] this one yeah if you search doodle icons
[49:14] SVG or figma you're gonna find libraries
[49:17] like this once like guys who
[49:20] have make big files of logos that look
[49:23] super cute and if you I don't know if
[49:26] you make an app for Doctor you can just
[49:27] pick this one and change the plus color
[49:30] and I don't know whatever make red or
[49:32] something and boom you have a logo
[49:34] that's how I usually do all my Logos so
[49:36] I really think
[49:39] um five minutes is you know for those
[49:41] kind of things I hope that answers
[49:45] why Wesley and share the chat charge
[49:48] more
[49:49] ah
[49:52] yeah I hope that's helpful
[49:54] um if there's anything else let me know
[49:56] I think in the bowler plate I also in
[49:59] the last part
[50:01] I uh give you a bunch of libraries that
[50:03] you can use for either logos Doodles
[50:06] blobs whatever
[50:14] all right
[50:15] um so emails is working
[50:18] uh so now we're gonna go even more
[50:20] private I'm gonna show you all my emails
[50:22] easy Korean there we go we have it here
[50:26] so this is uh yeah this is what we got
[50:29] after setting up email we receive a
[50:31] simple email that says you can sign in
[50:32] to localhost
[50:34] and boom I'm a logged in user now
[50:39] so I don't know it should actually
[50:41] work here
[50:43] in
[50:46] um what we're gonna what we're going to
[50:48] do we're gonna import I think it's
[50:50] called the use session
[50:54] uh
[50:59] that's why I love GitHub Co pilots I
[51:02] don't ever think about like oh you know
[51:04] how do which variables to call like
[51:06] makes it makes everything that's crazy
[51:10] uh
[51:12] we're just gonna show
[51:14] if the user is logged in uh I don't
[51:17] remember what's in the session
[51:20] per user dots oh perfect name I think
[51:25] name will be empty because I signed up
[51:26] by email
[51:27] but yeah okay so here I'm logged in as
[51:30] you can see it knows my email so it
[51:32] means the
[51:34] authorification is working well so we're
[51:36] logged in we're able to log in users
[51:39] well actually let me do this let me ask
[51:40] you what you guys want to do do you do
[51:43] you choose do you want me to move on and
[51:45] do more of what we need to do or should
[51:48] I set up the Google login thing login
[51:50] with Google
[51:55] is going to be yes or no
[51:57] and I will not know what to do with that
[52:01] keep Google okay
[52:03] okay sir skip Google move on
[52:09] okay we're good with that uh what else
[52:12] do we do that's the other question so
[52:15] we've set a database we've set up melgan
[52:18] uh API we don't need maybe we should set
[52:21] up stripe let's set up a big payee
[52:24] button and we're going to enter the
[52:26] stripe notification
[52:28] stripe subscriptions thing
[52:30] so yep click here
[52:35] and selling public details yep I'm not
[52:37] going to open a new stripe account
[52:41] I'm just going to show my face for one
[52:43] second because I'm going to log into
[52:44] stripe and I just want to make sure we
[52:45] don't have uh I don't show my
[52:47] credentials
[52:51] uh yeah okay that's good
[53:01] okay
[53:03] okay so Bingo we're back this is stripe
[53:06] dashboard this is
[53:08] um I would normally open a new business
[53:11] when I create a new stripe so you just
[53:13] go here and you type new accounts
[53:16] um this is boring you have to do to sign
[53:18] some papers you have to show some
[53:20] documents but usually it's recommended
[53:22] to have
[53:23] as one stripe accounts per project
[53:26] that's what thread recommends it helps
[53:28] also
[53:30] um you know if you get some esport
[53:31] issues uh it helps to the tax and things
[53:34] so better to have another stripe account
[53:36] for this use case I'm going to keep this
[53:38] one the workbook PDF thing it's an app
[53:40] that I made that is somehow related to
[53:42] what my wife is doing
[53:44] um it's language workbooks that are made
[53:46] with AI so you can learn any languages
[53:48] your favorite topics
[53:50] so it's kind of related and I'm just
[53:52] gonna go here and use that as an account
[53:54] for uh for that startup
[53:59] um and yeah so what we're gonna do we
[54:01] are going to add a new product
[54:04] I'm not gonna go really crazy on the
[54:06] design I'm gonna use uh
[54:09] my wife gave me some pictures
[54:12] I can use them
[54:13] um yeah I would not normally add the
[54:16] picture of my wife on the products
[54:19] but uh
[54:22] this is a very personal thing in this
[54:24] case it's it's only for her so it
[54:27] doesn't matter but normally you would
[54:29] have an image that's uh you know like
[54:31] something that represents your product
[54:33] so in that case she's selling
[54:35] um language PDFs so you could have a
[54:37] screenshot of a PDF or something like
[54:38] that
[54:40] um the product what would be called the
[54:41] product name uh we're gonna stay simple
[54:44] we're gonna keep the name of
[54:46] yeah easy Korean learn
[54:50] ing
[54:50] mean easy
[54:54] [Music]
[54:57] so that's a subscription thing so it's a
[55:01] standard pricing
[55:02] um I think she wants to price it at 99 a
[55:04] month
[55:06] um if you're curious that includes I
[55:08] think one PDF per week so you receive
[55:10] one
[55:11] um
[55:12] fun and an exciting uh you know PDF like
[55:15] where you have details like exercises
[55:17] grammar exercises vocabulary and all
[55:19] that and you also join a community of
[55:21] Korean learners
[55:22] um so you can have fun with other people
[55:24] there I think he makes some challenges
[55:25] where you have to complete the cuisine
[55:27] under whatever number of days or
[55:28] something
[55:29] it's a recurring thing it's a monthly
[55:31] stuff this is a different price and
[55:34] we're gonna add another one
[55:35] um just curious because she really
[55:37] [Music]
[55:38] she had some she have students who
[55:40] absolutely love her
[55:42] um so we're gonna try to add a yearly
[55:44] plan for like
[55:46] 10 10x one month
[55:48] so that will be something like I think
[55:51] uh 4.99 but wait should we maybe we
[55:55] should set up discounts
[55:56] thing
[55:58] um
[55:59] let me think
[56:03] wait
[56:04] one more currency
[56:06] this is not what I wanted recurring
[56:08] monthly
[56:11] oh yeah okay no I opened the wrong thing
[56:13] I will add another price
[56:15] I'm going to hold it
[56:19] I think we're gonna meet 4.99
[56:22] recurring yearly
[56:26] it was price okay
[56:28] and should there be
[56:33] yeah that that's one thing also you have
[56:36] you want to be uh thoughtful about
[56:37] because if you have a product that
[56:39] starts to get a little bit of traction
[56:41] and and you want to increase your price
[56:43] because you had a very cheap price
[56:45] during the launch
[56:47] um what I found out that the easiest way
[56:50] to do that is to actually set a very
[56:52] high price when you set up the stripe
[56:54] product because then you can create
[56:56] coupons that are tailored to what you
[56:58] want to discount so I could create a 99
[57:01] um a month price tag and just for the
[57:05] launch over a 50 50 off on that price
[57:10] and I think that would make things
[57:11] simpler because
[57:12] otherwise if you start now at 19 at 49
[57:16] what's going to happen is like in three
[57:18] months if it's working well and you want
[57:19] to increase the price you have to create
[57:20] a new product and I found and it's
[57:22] easier to create a new coupon than to
[57:23] create a new product it's also it makes
[57:25] data in your stripe dashboard a bit
[57:27] easier to manage
[57:29] so probably I'm going to say to set up
[57:31] something like
[57:35] um
[57:35] I don't know 70 Danger
[57:38] 79 and and they're going to be like a 30
[57:41] uh 30 dollars off
[57:44] who to be 49 and here
[57:49] is going to be something like 7.99
[57:53] uh
[57:55] yeah those prices seem a bit High
[57:58] um but she's really um
[58:01] yeah I wouldn't like charge 79 a month
[58:03] as a Indie hacker
[58:05] um unless you know you saw something
[58:06] really cool but like she has a really
[58:08] strong community of people who learn and
[58:10] and those students are super committed
[58:12] in in yeah this is why we're we're going
[58:15] to go with a higher price tag so 7979
[58:18] recurring recurring
[58:20] discounted discounted they're an adult
[58:22] here
[58:24] okay
[58:25] yeah we're gonna stick with that
[58:26] actually I should have created that
[58:27] probably no I'm gonna
[58:29] I [ __ ] it up okay don't forget to
[58:31] click the test mode
[58:34] that will make things easier so if
[58:37] you're not sure about your prices you
[58:38] can change it easily
[58:40] uh Korean made easy
[58:46] we're back so 79
[58:48] recurring one time monthly okay yep
[58:53] at another price
[58:55] 499
[58:57] 7.99
[59:01] recurring monthly you already
[59:04] it just mattered
[59:06] okay
[59:08] the thing
[59:09] is there okay stream is Here I Am the
[59:11] credential
[59:13] with the credential Pinnock
[59:18] is it a good idea to create the price
[59:20] and so if you have a freemium SAS is it
[59:22] a good day
[59:23] um
[59:24] but
[59:30] I think if you have a freemium if you
[59:33] have two plans
[59:34] one is a free plan
[59:36] I would just not create any plan I'll
[59:39] just have a Boolean in the database
[59:40] that's
[59:42] sets to True when the user pay on for
[59:45] the Premium plan and do nothing with the
[59:49] premium one
[59:53] yoniko
[59:57] boy
[59:59] hey
[60:01] okay uh so we have two prices created
[60:03] here what we do is we add them in the
[60:06] config file
[60:08] yep here we go
[60:11] um
[60:12] oh I closed stripe my bad
[60:15] so in here we have the we're going to
[60:18] test things
[60:19] on the local development server
[60:22] so the prices will be different from the
[60:24] test mode and and the production
[60:26] environment so here because we're in
[60:27] development we want to have this price
[60:30] and here the yearly plan will be here
[60:36] a development boom
[60:39] there's a program name
[60:41] um which is going to say something like
[60:42] monthly
[60:44] and yearly I'm going to have to create
[60:47] those prices again when I'm going to be
[60:49] on the
[60:50] on on production
[60:52] to prices
[60:55] and now
[60:57] normally now we should be able to open
[61:00] a checkout session for those prices oh
[61:03] let me just clarify this
[61:05] uh yeah the incor tag is here the prices
[61:07] so this is the current price that you
[61:09] have so this is 49 and the anchor as we
[61:13] said is 79. we didn't create a discount
[61:15] yet but we have to set it up
[61:18] the pricing currency here is 7.99
[61:22] and here we're going to be at 4.99
[61:28] yeah okay there we go
[61:33] uh yeah I need the stripe API keys so
[61:36] you get them
[61:37] you go in the developer stuff
[61:41] I think it doesn't matter if I show my
[61:43] keys here
[61:45] doesn't matter no okay I'm just gonna
[61:47] remove
[61:48] I'm gonna I'm gonna hide these for just
[61:51] a bit of white setting up the keys
[61:53] uh you go you go to the developer panel
[61:55] you will have a publishable I don't know
[61:59] the right way to pronounce it
[62:00] publishable key
[62:02] a secret a secret key
[62:05] and a Weeble key I'll I'll keep it live
[62:08] to show you how to get a Web book
[62:09] because it's not very straightforward
[62:11] public key strip secret key and the
[62:14] strip Playbook
[62:18] of endpoints
[62:22] and
[62:24] local listener
[62:31] testing the local environment
[62:37] right yeah
[62:44] one second
[62:48] okay we're back
[62:54] all right API endpoint so we're going to
[62:58] test in logo first so I'll need to log
[63:00] in with stripe
[63:02] for that you need to have the stripe CLI
[63:04] installed
[63:06] pretty straightforward
[63:09] login in
[63:21] and then one second
[63:24] I need to add this key because basically
[63:26] when you log in stripe will give you
[63:30] um
[63:31] it's supposed to give me a web hook I do
[63:34] it oh no okay okay then you're gonna
[63:35] listen to the stripe events on the
[63:37] localhost I'll show you the code
[63:41] um
[63:42] one second
[63:47] API that book such a stripe
[64:16] almost back
[64:19] okay
[64:25] yo Kevin
[64:27] we've got the stripe environment kit
[64:29] setup we've got the webbook listening
[64:32] um so you have those here so you have
[64:36] once you set up your keys You Will Go On
[64:39] on stripe you go to webhooks at endpoint
[64:42] test in local environments and then
[64:45] you'll just follow what they say and
[64:46] then when you log in when you after
[64:47] logging in you're gonna run you're gonna
[64:49] tell us try basically to forward events
[64:51] to your local environment so for us it's
[64:54] going to be localhost 3000 slash API
[64:57] slash web stripe
[64:59] and we already have with the ship as
[65:01] baller blades uh something that's set up
[65:03] and ready to listen the web hook and
[65:04] make sure that they're actually coming
[65:05] from stripe
[65:07] um
[65:08] yep so you're in the API folder
[65:11] um and you can see here in webhook we
[65:14] have one for million to forward emails
[65:16] and one for stripe that is actually here
[65:19] so that thing here is where a lot of
[65:21] magic happens because
[65:24] um first you want to check that you know
[65:26] the events are actually coming from
[65:27] stripe that they are legit and stuff
[65:29] then we're gonna listen to different
[65:31] kinds of events the most common ones are
[65:33] already set up so we have four events
[65:36] deleted the checkout session which is
[65:39] the the usually the entrance point for
[65:41] every app so if someone pays you're
[65:43] gonna get these webhook events that's
[65:46] where you do the logic so things like
[65:48] you know get the user in the database
[65:50] turn on a Boolean that says the user has
[65:52] access to this or that resource and and
[65:55] finish
[65:57] um if you have a checkout session
[65:59] expired you can use it to send abundant
[66:02] transaction emails so you can just
[66:03] import the send email function from
[66:05] melgen uh and you just use it there and
[66:08] you just gonna say like hey you know I
[66:10] noticed you were interested in that
[66:11] product but you didn't purchase here is
[66:12] a 50 off coupon for uh for you whatever
[66:16] you also have those two events that
[66:18] we're going to need today for
[66:19] subscriptions
[66:21] um when especially when the customer's
[66:23] delete it's his or her subscription you
[66:27] want to turn off that Boolean
[66:28] um this is where the magic will happen
[66:31] uh so now the logic is empty we're going
[66:33] to add it based on the biz on our date
[66:34] but that's basically how it works
[66:39] um so we're good with to go with stripe
[66:41] uh in Germany if everything is fine I
[66:44] can click here and you know price oh
[66:46] yeah because now Okay so
[66:48] this is tied to a function that we have
[66:52] here to create a checkout by default
[66:55] it's made for one-time payments but to
[66:57] turn it for subscription I think you
[66:58] just have to send one little thing
[67:01] uh where is it
[67:04] reach accounts
[67:06] I think we're just gonna say payments
[67:10] honey come on
[67:12] come on be nice with me please uh GitHub
[67:15] go pilot
[67:17] right now
[67:18] um
[67:19] I'm gonna say setup uh
[67:22] option
[67:30] I'm listening to search in the in the
[67:32] dock for for the stripe just oh I think
[67:35] a mode
[67:37] I think it's mode yeah there we go
[67:41] there's a payment method did I pass the
[67:43] payment method wait what do you say
[67:45] again
[67:46] but pass the recurring price either
[67:47] switch description mode or use winter
[67:51] specified payment mode where do they
[67:53] specify oh I think oh yeah yeah okay you
[67:57] know that's not bad my bad
[67:58] it's because
[68:01] um this is we have to use a function
[68:02] from the library
[68:03] to use this one here
[68:05] mode sub oh that's why copilot was
[68:09] struggling
[68:12] um so a bunch of stuff when you create a
[68:13] stripe checkouts
[68:15] um you can add promotion codes you can
[68:16] create invoices I think it does you it
[68:18] did automatically when you actually do
[68:20] subscriptions
[68:21] we might have to remove some stuff here
[68:23] let's keep trying
[68:24] demon data yeah we don't need to pass
[68:27] this this is this is
[68:29] those are working well when you do like
[68:31] one-time payments but for subscriptions
[68:33] strip will do it
[68:35] customer creation is also automatic
[68:40] but what did you say
[68:43] this worker she can only be using
[68:44] payment mode
[68:45] where is custom Recreation
[68:56] enable invocation same yeah just
[68:59] removing a bunch of stuff that you need
[69:00] only when you do one-time payments okay
[69:02] so here we go
[69:03] we have the stripes checkout session
[69:05] people can subscribe
[69:07] um
[69:08] can have their promotion code
[69:10] and pay okay
[69:12] that's cool
[69:13] I'm going to add a coupon code actually
[69:16] I don't know how I'm gonna do this uh
[69:22] because we need we need a coupon that's
[69:25] going to be available for ever whenever
[69:28] you subscribe
[69:30] maybe I should just maybe I should not
[69:32] anchor prices here because it might just
[69:35] make it more complicated for this stream
[69:40] uh and it tests just real quick
[69:44] uh
[69:47] 30 percent
[69:54] yeah that goes
[69:56] yep you pass this in the config file and
[69:59] normally it should apply it
[70:01] automatically
[70:08] accounts
[70:11] oh yeah
[70:14] I'm gonna send it and he said I'm gonna
[70:16] say
[70:25] okay
[70:29] well you know it doesn't apply
[70:36] subscribe this is not coupon ID
[70:40] okay that's where I'm supposed to edit
[70:46] accounts we're gonna say it's this
[71:00] that thing here
[71:05] all the promotion code oh yeah okay
[71:15] go back
[71:21] okay so we have this thing uh
[71:24] all right I'll probably talk with my
[71:26] wife to see what she how she wants to
[71:27] handle it
[71:29] um yeah you can you can just Pass coupon
[71:31] if you want
[71:32] you don't have to
[71:36] but it's working now this is working
[71:38] maybe here
[71:40] we have it there
[71:42] and we can just do like uh whatever
[71:46] up
[71:49] okay we're good to go stripe is set up
[71:51] uh and we are ready to get our hands
[71:53] dirty
[71:55] make sure the stream is still live oh
[71:57] yeah
[72:00] Mark is so handsome I give you a Korean
[72:03] heart
[72:05] have you ever worked I've never worked
[72:07] as a developer I worked I worked oh yeah
[72:09] that's a fun story I work for Tai Lopez
[72:11] for six months and I was fired
[72:13] that's the only time I I was a really
[72:16] developer
[72:22] this this streamy is turning uh into a
[72:26] whole new big massive U-turn here
[72:36] I'm finishing you for not being in the
[72:37] trash key version this is really getting
[72:40] into a kinky stream guys
[72:42] I'm punishing you I love it yeah
[72:48] all right so what we set up here quick
[72:50] recap
[72:51] um we have a landing page that needs a
[72:53] lot of improvements
[72:55] we have stripe setup we have you log in
[72:59] with emails
[73:01] and we have the product that's live at
[73:04] easycare.gov
[73:08] there we go
[73:11] so recap
[73:14] notes
[73:16] we bought the domain oh the phone thing
[73:18] let's do the phone together that's a fun
[73:19] thing
[73:20] um Google phones
[73:23] that's a little bit uh
[73:25] right I think
[73:27] I always on Twitter say that people
[73:30] should shift fast but there is one thing
[73:32] that I think is important is the phones
[73:34] I don't know why but for me it it
[73:37] doesn't take much time any it changed
[73:39] the whole mood of a site
[73:42] like recently for sheepfest I used it I
[73:45] used these phones I don't know if it's a
[73:47] new phone or something but for me the
[73:49] phone is absolutely gorgeous and I have
[73:51] a feeling that these
[73:53] makes a lot of
[73:55] it creates I don't know it creates a
[73:56] Vibe like I I go on on this side and I
[73:58] feel like it's more professional it
[74:00] looks like there's something so I think
[74:02] phones are something that you you pick
[74:04] once and then once you have it you just
[74:06] change the whole mood of your site so
[74:08] for
[74:10] uh for the change Google font has
[74:12] changed
[74:14] oh wow that's more oh that's fun
[74:17] search phone filter
[74:19] all these results oh [ __ ] I'm lost now
[74:22] is there any way we could oh [ __ ]
[74:25] they're smart
[74:26] really smart
[74:28] um
[74:30] do you guys know any fonts that you want
[74:32] to try
[74:34] just throw it away
[74:37] how is Tyler plays like
[74:39] you want if I enter the question that
[74:42] might be kicked out of the Stream
[74:45] he's a very smart
[74:47] he's very smart ambitious and work
[74:50] oriented person but he really did not
[74:52] fit my life I'm trying to uh
[74:56] and all this with a gloves
[75:01] hit commit m dot yep
[75:05] okay phones
[75:06] um oh [ __ ] I'm lost with the new Google
[75:08] phones
[75:10] we had the filters uh
[75:13] what you want to oh we can do that
[75:15] Korean Made Easy that's the third thing
[75:18] what you kind of want to do is
[75:22] I'm sorry I'm trying to also figure out
[75:23] how this new thing work yeah this here
[75:26] the number of styles it's kind of
[75:28] important because if you took a phone
[75:29] that has zero or two Styles this number
[75:31] of style is basically whether you have
[75:33] different number of typefaces so you
[75:36] could have a very thin the variation of
[75:38] the phones a medium one a bigger one
[75:41] like a semi bold or medium and then boom
[75:43] boom boom from 100 to 8 or 900 something
[75:46] if you take one that has doesn't have
[75:48] many styles so let's say only like a
[75:50] normal
[75:51] um normal size then you're gonna end up
[75:55] with a site where you cannot do bold or
[75:57] thin or bigger bold or whatever so try
[76:00] to go with like five or six at least at
[76:02] least four I'd say so you get something
[76:04] that you know you can play around with
[76:06] the front weight
[76:08] um I'm taking the chat if you guys
[76:10] Poppins
[76:12] I mean Korean phones
[76:14] on Siri that's a quick send okay let's
[76:17] write those two
[76:18] bins and quicksand let's see
[76:23] oh it looks a little bit like nunito
[76:26] oh it's the next one how many
[76:29] uh studies do we have oh we have enough
[76:31] medium regular samay bold and bold okay
[76:33] that could be it
[76:34] okay maybe my wife will have the latest
[76:36] uh word on that I have to ask later but
[76:39] I kind of like it oh Poppins is nice too
[76:45] you guys are good you guys are pretty
[76:47] good those are really good fit for the
[76:48] for that
[76:50] um let's try both actually
[76:53] uh
[76:54] did she send me something
[76:57] wait I need to check I think she sent me
[77:01] she might have sent me some
[77:04] well let me check
[77:06] all right I'm gonna do something I have
[77:08] to do I'm gonna show my face I just
[77:10] checking over WhatsApp messages with my
[77:12] wife and that can get
[77:14] uh you know I think she has a
[77:17] relationship you don't know what you're
[77:18] gonna find there so give me one second I
[77:20] check if she sent me some copyrighting
[77:22] for for the for the site she wants to
[77:25] set up
[77:27] headline okay
[77:29] okay yeah she sent me a few
[77:32] a few stuff for the site
[77:35] I just gonna copy past this actually I
[77:38] can share my screen now there's nothing
[77:39] kinky in there
[77:42] that's the chat so she sent me this uh I
[77:47] don't know how I'm gonna make use of
[77:48] this but
[77:51] and then I'm gonna cut the stem here
[77:53] this is a copy
[77:56] uh
[77:58] all right
[78:00] it's easier to experience with phones
[78:02] when you have a little clue of the copy
[78:05] because here I just the reason I just
[78:07] because here blah blah blah doesn't mean
[78:09] anything and I feel like
[78:12] we have something that's real it's gonna
[78:14] be easier to judge whether the font is
[78:15] good or not
[78:18] okay that looks a bit more
[78:21] a bit more Pro okay so for the layout
[78:24] we're going to import as you guys said
[78:25] Poppins
[78:29] and uh what was it
[78:33] I can tell you're tired when you cannot
[78:35] remember what happened in one minute ago
[78:38] Facebook
[78:41] Philippines
[78:43] quicksand okay yeah that's it
[78:46] click the send and you said space
[78:49] grotesque
[78:51] it's gonna be wild
[78:53] um
[78:55] so let's try
[79:05] quick sense and
[79:08] spacecraft boom boom boom
[79:12] ready for a big big change
[79:21] oh we have to uh available weights
[79:25] I think that's here
[79:28] yes
[79:31] the pilots for the wind no still not
[79:34] five four four five six seven
[79:38] maybe the copilot just is just putting
[79:40] on random numbers or maybe they have to
[79:42] be strings uh yeah strings
[79:51] well give me something
[79:53] all right I'm going to open a new app
[79:56] um I did that for another app I think
[79:58] for make Lending
[80:01] uh
[80:04] Lending
[80:07] is that it
[80:11] and I think the phones
[80:15] or is it wait
[80:20] sorry sorry
[80:23] I'm gonna find it if you guys know
[80:24] actually what I'm should I should be
[80:26] putting in here
[80:30] just for that error I know and I have to
[80:33] put something in here
[80:34] I just don't remember exactly where
[80:38] um
[80:48] oh I did it we're here
[80:52] subset Latin
[80:55] okay
[80:57] oh we got here
[81:04] wait ah okay just
[81:07] that's it
[81:10] no there must be something wrong here
[81:15] what it's just I had to change this okay
[81:18] doesn't matter anyway it's working
[81:20] okay we have one variation uh with
[81:22] Poppins
[81:24] is nice
[81:26] it's a cutie pie
[81:29] unlike it
[81:30] if I reuse it for further yeah it's cute
[81:35] actually you guys can vote and decide uh
[81:38] here's if if you're watching this uh
[81:41] we're deciding which font to use so we
[81:43] have the Poppins ones
[81:46] um let's try the quicksand one
[81:52] different mood
[81:59] maybe I'll take a screenshot of it of it
[82:11] up
[82:21] Made Easy spacecraft disk
[82:23] I think this one is a nice one but that
[82:26] would go well for like
[82:28] or an app that like ship has like a text
[82:30] stuff I have a feeling more than a
[82:32] Korean
[82:34] um
[82:36] more than a Korean learning platform so
[82:38] we're gonna stick with either Poppins or
[82:40] this one let's pull on
[82:44] the files and see which one we like the
[82:46] most
[82:54] nope I didn't want to open it
[82:56] or are you
[83:03] all right it's time to vote
[83:06] which of those two films do you guys
[83:09] prefer you can just say left or right
[83:11] I'm gonna keep them here for a little
[83:13] while
[83:59] okay
[84:02] okay left left left
[84:04] wait who's the body one two three four
[84:06] four full left good day sir hey good day
[84:09] right we have one right four left so I
[84:12] guess
[84:14] this is going to be a left one then
[84:18] all right so which one is left it's
[84:21] Poppins no beans for the wind
[84:24] here we go
[84:30] that's it
[84:32] um
[84:33] I think we're gonna start building that
[84:34] landing page
[84:41] yep
[84:44] yep yep yep we have to build a landing
[84:46] page
[84:47] pretty much there's so many things to do
[84:50] when you start a project it's easy to
[84:52] get drowned into uh which one do you do
[84:55] we set up um stripey setup Google login
[84:57] we'll see later customer support we
[84:59] don't need it
[85:01] um SEO thing as well
[85:04] uh yeah something yeah something
[85:08] something that's worth checking is here
[85:10] I have those two tags
[85:14] um those are custom components that come
[85:17] with the cheapest bowler plate where it
[85:19] does all the SEO thing for you so
[85:23] it will add all the meta tags the the
[85:26] right meta tags the right description
[85:28] the social open graph tags and all that
[85:31] based on your config file
[85:33] so it knows your ad name is easy Korean
[85:35] and it's gonna make sure that you know
[85:37] you don't launch with no app name or
[85:39] nothing
[85:41] um it makes the life a little bit easier
[85:43] um you just import them add it to any
[85:45] page you want to have tags on it so
[85:47] typically static pages that you want to
[85:49] rank on Google and those are those are
[85:52] going to be displayed in there and make
[85:53] the life much easier
[85:55] um maybe we can see
[85:57] I didn't config anything yet so it might
[86:00] be missed but you're here you can see up
[86:01] to 50 characters so you would typically
[86:03] write your description here and all all
[86:05] the tags are coming straight like where
[86:07] to find the image
[86:09] or your site when you share it on social
[86:11] media who is the creator and Twitter
[86:12] what is the canonical URL
[86:15] all those things that are all made with
[86:18] one one company
[86:22] um
[86:26] all right okay it's design time
[86:31] uh
[86:33] so usually when I I'm a poor and she's
[86:36] like there uh but I try to keep my
[86:38] website very simple so I I will uh have
[86:43] different sections on the website
[86:45] as you can see here the header the hero
[86:47] the pricing
[86:48] and and then so I would build a
[86:51] structure like this like know which
[86:53] sections it will be and then for each
[86:54] section I will write you know the
[86:56] headline the descriptions and all that
[86:58] and then at the end I will see if I can
[87:01] make something cuter if I can add a
[87:02] testimonial here if I can add a cute SVG
[87:05] there my wife is learning it's a current
[87:06] learning platform so maybe that would
[87:08] make sense to add some like cute Korean
[87:09] sentences
[87:11] um here or there to remind the person uh
[87:14] you know what they're here for
[87:15] uh yeah that's pretty much what I would
[87:17] do so the beginning will be a bit like
[87:19] raw like abrupt
[87:22] and then we're gonna improve the design
[87:23] later
[87:26] so we want to have a the header the
[87:28] pricing will stay the the hero will say
[87:31] stay
[87:32] you want to have testimonials clearly
[87:36] testimonials we want to have the pricing
[87:37] that's there
[87:39] I think we need a figure section page
[87:42] where so there are two things that you
[87:44] okay well pilot is getting crazy let's
[87:48] see what that does
[87:50] okay wait come on if you write the code
[87:52] you have to finish it at least
[87:55] all right okay get up go Pilots so you
[87:58] sleep for now uh so testimonials pricing
[88:02] uh one feature ah he knows that the
[88:05] feature stuff
[88:06] features will be actually two things we
[88:09] have two things we have
[88:11] so they're they're
[88:13] weekly PDFs that students will receive
[88:17] so
[88:19] we need to explain that Weekly PDF and
[88:22] also Community what he knows that
[88:28] that's the magic and the git of copilot
[88:30] is insane how come does he know
[88:31] Community I didn't write this anywhere
[88:35] this is insane you're gonna have a
[88:37] community feature as well where people
[88:38] can join challenges and be part of a
[88:40] WhatsApp group and talk with each other
[88:42] that's the features
[88:45] um I think we're going to need another
[88:47] testimonial somewhere she has a bunch of
[88:49] testimony so we need to display those
[88:52] do we need an FAQ it would take five
[88:54] minutes so we can build an FAQ
[88:57] we can add another testimonials
[89:00] and that should be it
[89:04] is
[89:07] um
[89:08] yeah and then students sign up and then
[89:11] we're going to start the the business
[89:13] part of it like like I mean the logic
[89:15] part of it whatever we call it uh where
[89:16] people sign up download PDFs uh handle
[89:20] subscription I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna
[89:22] add also something where people can uh
[89:24] upgrade or downgrade their subscriptions
[89:25] cancel them uh yeah this is going to be
[89:29] a second part of the video we're gonna
[89:30] we're gonna do the landing page first
[89:40] race again yeah Poppins for the win
[89:45] every current food and some Market a
[89:48] lovely uh every Koreans would I think it
[89:50] has to be the Korean barbecue
[89:53] it has to be the Korean barbecue and if
[89:55] I choose like a specific food I would
[89:57] say kimchi kimchi is so delicious
[89:59] it's so healthy
[90:06] I think I need a coffee I think I'll
[90:08] bring you guys to my coffee machine
[90:12] all right there's gonna be a moving
[90:13] stream that has never been done before
[90:15] you're gonna visit my house
[90:19] there you go little coffee I'm a bit
[90:21] tired and now we're gonna start the
[90:22] landing page thing
[90:24] so that needs a a little bit of energy
[90:26] from the caffeine
[90:33] it's
[90:35] I hope it's not gonna be
[90:37] I hope it's not gonna be 24 hours I hope
[90:39] I can sleep I had four hours of sleep so
[90:41] I'm kind of like operate on a low energy
[90:44] level
[90:49] so I hope I can I can finish I don't
[90:51] know somewhere tonight it's 10 or 11
[90:53] here
[90:54] house tour okay real real quick it's
[90:58] it might be some some stuff that we
[91:00] don't want to find in here but that's uh
[91:03] that's the room I was in that's the
[91:05] bedroom I have with my wherever sleep is
[91:07] my wife
[91:08] uh this is the little garden that's uh
[91:11] in our Villa
[91:14] um behind is the sofa where I record
[91:16] most uh product launch videos
[91:20] uh we have a kitchen here where the
[91:23] coffee machine the most important coffee
[91:24] machine is as you can see the red thing
[91:29] wait I know that's boring way I show you
[91:31] my screen
[91:33] I mean that's a bit better that way
[91:39] yeah
[91:41] 4 30 a.m oh you're living in a you're
[91:45] living in a nighttime
[91:47] so yeah uh kitchen that's uh
[91:51] shoes and trash very interesting
[91:55] we have this little streets out there
[91:57] that's where I get out I go surf I was
[91:59] surfing this morning it was fun uh and
[92:01] we have another bedroom here that's a
[92:03] bit messy because it's a desk basically
[92:06] for my wife
[92:09] there we go that was a little house tour
[92:12] that costs uh I think in total with the
[92:15] garden it's about 120 square meters
[92:17] which is definitely a lot for us and the
[92:20] cost is about
[92:22] ten thousand dollars a year
[92:24] there's roughly 900 or 800 a month and
[92:28] we live in in Bali in the south of Bali
[92:32] near nusadua I don't know if
[92:35] some of you have been here in the center
[92:37] in the peninsula
[92:41] coffee time
[93:35] that changu
[93:37] um
[93:39] and the main kind of like the mainland
[93:42] but the where we live is in the South so
[93:45] it depends to that that's at the very
[93:46] south of body it's less uh busy there
[93:49] and life is also kind of cheaper
[93:57] oh my TV grab some coffee
[94:15] oh yeah making a little cafe latte
[94:39] thank you
[95:02] foreign
[95:46] good to go
[95:49] that's a tricky move to move uh
[95:52] a computer a coffee and open a door
[96:04] these these stream is getting as
[96:07] personal As It Gets
[96:10] foreign
[96:13] okay
[96:20] I need to improve my letter art but it's
[96:22] tasty though
[96:35] right
[96:41] the the second one the second one is the
[96:44] most secure in the world the most
[96:46] precious give me one second I'm going to
[96:49] the bathroom real quick and I'll be back
[96:51] for the landing page see you
[98:13] hey ho super extrovert hey a word no
[98:19] I don't know I don't I don't think so no
[98:22] I have very low filter when you become
[98:25] my friend I I can you know
[98:27] there's there's nothing I hide
[98:29] but in general if you put me in a crowd
[98:32] in a public area or just in a crowd with
[98:33] people like five people in a room I
[98:36] would feel very weird and awkward and I
[98:38] would leave or or be very quiet
[98:41] I don't know it's a strange feeling but
[98:43] at the same time I don't hide anything
[98:44] so I really don't know
[98:55] all right that's good
[98:58] okay we're backstream uh let's see what
[99:01] how that goes on Twitter if some uh some
[99:04] people saw that tweet
[99:07] and how the stream going by the way I
[99:09] have no idea
[99:10] how many people are we oh nice six
[99:12] people on Twitch
[99:14] ah so cool
[99:18] started in 18 minutes ago bingo
[99:24] I think I can close that because my
[99:26] computer will burn
[99:29] and close that thing as well
[99:37] but we're in bits on the CPU thing
[99:41] hey when there was some sun in the
[99:43] morning sun is gone
[99:50] kind of lovely
[100:01] okay
[100:04] designing time
[100:07] oh are we gonna do that
[100:12] let's go back to what my wife sent uh
[100:14] headline and announced our journey
[100:16] all right so we're gonna go for the hero
[100:18] section first uh I think it makes sense
[100:22] to show
[100:25] um some
[100:26] photos of what you get so
[100:31] oh yeah maybe I can show I can show what
[100:33] I did with other apps so it's shippers
[100:35] this is my cleaning uh
[100:38] and whatever whatever can we use in the
[100:41] page now
[100:43] so usually what I do is on every landing
[100:46] page I design the hero section the
[100:48] headline has a big title that's supposed
[100:52] to X2
[100:54] to tell the user why would a random
[100:57] stranger from the internet who doesn't
[101:00] know me at all would stay on this page
[101:02] more than 30 seconds
[101:04] this is what I try to answer in these
[101:06] headlines so for make lending is because
[101:08] they want to make a beautiful landing
[101:10] page real quickly for ship pass is
[101:13] because developers want to ship their
[101:15] project much faster
[101:16] and for Indie page is because it makes
[101:18] you unique on Twitter
[101:21] then here I would explain
[101:24] how am I gonna deliver what I promised
[101:26] you how I'm gonna help you build
[101:29] startups ship startup faster
[101:32] so usually it's the how part here I
[101:36] explained that we use an AI to create
[101:37] the landing page actually this could be
[101:40] improved but yeah we could use the
[101:41] landing page we can use AI to create
[101:43] your landing page and so you can free
[101:45] yourself from designers or developers
[101:47] something in here on Indie page I
[101:50] explain you what you get what features
[101:51] you got and how is it going to help you
[101:54] also the create the how do you call it
[101:57] like the picture or whatever
[101:59] um this thing here that the illustration
[102:01] uh here I try to showcase the product in
[102:05] the most transparent way so
[102:07] here you can see some people that you
[102:09] might know on Twitter like Nick like um
[102:13] um using the product so that's a mix of
[102:15] social proof they're using the product
[102:17] and at the same time he's like oh you
[102:18] could get a beautiful Indie page that
[102:21] way
[102:21] for mixing I pushed it a little bit
[102:24] further and I did an interactive demo so
[102:26] you could click here and it's going to
[102:28] tell you like oh if I write coaster land
[102:29] marketing is going to make me a website
[102:31] that looks like a course site where I
[102:34] can buy some course and then it show you
[102:37] different use cases for e-commerce or or
[102:39] for podcasts some some of those things
[102:42] for Sheet best what I did is I might
[102:45] change into the future and add more
[102:47] libraries but what I did basically was
[102:49] to take all the boring stuff that we do
[102:51] you know we always have at some point to
[102:52] set up an email Center system the
[102:55] mongodb the title in and stuff and I
[102:58] tried to bottle that boom
[103:02] into this like Circle and show oh
[103:06] actually these all that can just be that
[103:08] that one line of code
[103:11] uh that's that's kind of like the
[103:14] mindset behind making lending Pages the
[103:16] button oops
[103:19] I'm gonna open the checkouts this is not
[103:20] one internet the the button here usually
[103:23] uh you could have the classic get
[103:26] started but it makes sense to reinsist
[103:29] on what people are going to get so here
[103:30] get cheap ads because she pass is the
[103:33] name is very clear ship fast I didn't
[103:36] need to say something like [ __ ] faster
[103:38] or sheep or whatever so get cheapest
[103:41] makes sense but for make Landing I think
[103:42] yeah here you can make you click a
[103:44] button and you make a website so that
[103:45] delivers the promise that you're gonna
[103:47] make it in seconds
[103:48] or this one
[103:50] um yeah what you're gonna get and I
[103:52] could have say get started but instead I
[103:54] say like you know get like claim my
[103:55] Indie page or build my Indie page
[103:57] this is what I do um I try to add some
[104:00] um
[104:01] when you launch on product turns get
[104:02] those badge put them out it shows uh
[104:05] even though you get third fix or
[104:07] whatever it just shows that you know
[104:08] you've been there you put on your work
[104:09] you launched so that's pretty cool
[104:11] um add some testimonials if you can this
[104:13] is one from then if your friend
[104:17] um yeah you can see here add the number
[104:19] of you know sites you've created as a
[104:22] number of users whatever and a little
[104:24] something that makes people like oh okay
[104:25] this is trustable and then as more as
[104:28] the more you launch the more you show
[104:30] your app the more you're gonna get the
[104:31] more usage you will get so the more
[104:33] relatable trustable it will become then
[104:35] you can add links to likely you've
[104:37] launched on hiker news and you've been
[104:38] showcased so you can add a feature on
[104:40] Hacker News and all that
[104:42] so we're going to do the same for my
[104:43] wife she doesn't have uh she doesn't
[104:45] need to be featured on hiker news but
[104:47] she have she has a bunch of testimonials
[104:49] so
[104:50] um we're gonna first do the headline so
[104:52] Korean made easy
[104:55] um if you guys actually want to suggest
[104:58] stuff that would be so nice uh
[105:01] actually maybe maybe you can you guys
[105:04] can just say it what do you wanna what
[105:07] should be the headline
[105:15] no I don't think I've disabled any chats
[105:20] now I think yeah it's supposed to be
[105:22] still here maybe just people are going
[105:24] to bed because it might be late for you
[105:27] guys in the states and especially in
[105:28] Europe
[105:29] and we're not a lot in in Asia
[105:34] so
[105:35] um
[105:37] Marine Made Easy I think we could remove
[105:39] that thing
[105:42] made easy
[105:54] I'm gonna say something to my friends uh
[106:11] hey guys it's time to drop in the
[106:13] YouTuber live uh and drop some marketing
[106:16] gems because we we need to write a
[106:18] copywriting uh for the for the website
[106:20] so come on in
[106:22] I'll try to see if I can get some of my
[106:24] friends joining the chat and suggesting
[106:27] the really good marketer learning then
[106:29] during training next day like 30 days
[106:32] okay
[106:37] and made easy to learn Korean in next
[106:38] day
[106:43] maybe this one
[106:53] ingredient BBC workbooks
[106:57] I think it's gonna think more actually
[107:00] it's gonna actually take longer than
[107:01] them because Curry needs very hard
[107:03] so yeah for now I'll stay with current
[107:05] made it easy
[107:06] um so they get BBK workbooks to practice
[107:08] Korean with fun bites exercise about
[107:10] K-pop k-drama troubles and more
[107:15] join easy current oh maybe we can say
[107:16] join join easy Korean because it's
[107:18] actually
[107:19] a community
[107:23] so that would make sense
[107:32] that's weird
[107:37] um
[107:40] so she works for secret and love current
[107:43] your weekly guys awaits
[107:46] speak read and love Korean everything
[107:48] goes away
[107:51] why not why not why not
[107:57] and I'm gonna keep this on the side and
[107:59] and see I think I'm gonna also ask my
[108:01] wife to review this she's a she's the
[108:04] one who's going to have the final word
[108:05] on this
[108:06] here is what I have uh so these are
[108:10] screenshots from her students
[108:12] and this here okay these are the PDFs
[108:25] there's no yeah I think that could make
[108:26] sense this one could yeah this one could
[108:28] be good this one could be really good
[108:31] we're going to call it demo and we're
[108:33] going to edit
[108:36] we're gonna go to easy Korean public and
[108:39] we're going to add these in here
[108:43] uh so we're gonna import images here
[108:47] Imports
[108:49] um
[108:53] I'm gonna say that's the demo here
[108:59] demo
[109:05] through eight
[109:07] not found where are you public Emoji Pig
[109:11] yep
[109:15] all right that looks much more like her
[109:17] now
[109:20] okay
[109:21] uh I think
[109:25] I think we need to Showcase it's a PDF
[109:27] so we're gonna make this image pop up a
[109:29] little bit
[109:31] uh
[109:35] that's what we're gonna take because I
[109:36] think we can try this
[109:39] so yeah I'm gonna show you what I did
[109:41] here before sorry
[109:45] testimonials so with the
[109:49] uh
[109:50] the men cannot
[109:52] just cannot do two things at the same
[109:54] time I think
[109:57] and write codes impossible
[110:00] and explain okay so there's another
[110:02] component in the ship as well a blade
[110:03] called testimonial one
[110:05] um this is a simple testimonial that you
[110:07] can see from this girl who says she love
[110:09] the service
[110:11] um
[110:12] it comes with a boilerplate it has uh I
[110:15] use this it's from a friend of mine
[110:16] called Elias on Twitter uh he made
[110:18] beautiful designs and he's a SEO master
[110:20] and he made this card here that I find
[110:23] he's pretty cute and I feel this would
[110:25] be actually a really good fit to
[110:26] showcase the PDF of my wife
[110:29] here because it looks like it's kind of
[110:31] like in a in a frame I'm going to reuse
[110:34] that piece of code
[110:35] and this is here
[110:37] I'm just going to add it to the image
[110:42] have it here and I think it needs to be
[110:44] wrapped somewhere with that thing
[110:48] uh
[110:55] or lady around it yeah
[110:57] yeah that looks better
[110:59] it actually looks like in a frame
[111:03] if you can make the borders pop up a
[111:04] little bit
[111:06] is it no
[111:13] White
[111:23] oh yeah I need to fix that okay
[111:25] [Music]
[111:26] um
[111:35] let me try to understand what's
[111:36] happening
[111:38] LG with phone
[111:47] oh I see what's happening
[111:54] oh yeah we don't need to make it
[111:59] we need
[112:09] hey of course
[112:13] they're throwing something in there if
[112:14] that's not gonna work
[112:29] I like to rounded because we have okay
[112:32] we have base things in here
[112:34] is probably what I need to move it
[112:39] try to do something like this
[112:42] yeah okay that's working now
[112:44] so max width okay
[112:46] MD Max with uh
[112:49] actually I'm not gonna bother too much
[112:52] I'm gonna say
[112:54] I can split
[112:55] uh Excel Maybe
[112:59] okay that looks good on large device so
[113:03] and maxed with uh s LG
[113:08] foreign
[113:11] [Music]
[113:16] I think that's cool
[113:18] do we have the padding yeah we have
[113:21] padding X Y so maybe we just don't even
[113:22] need this
[113:25] yeah I think it's cool
[113:28] maybe just a little bit bigger
[113:32] maybe even bigger
[113:37] it's actually not getting bigger uh
[113:41] wait what is it
[113:54] these have to shrink
[114:00] yeah that's what I was thinking is still
[114:02] working
[114:07] on third
[114:15] one third one third that's too small
[114:18] to fifth
[114:26] checking what you guys thinking

[128:30] as you can get uh the the issue is going
[128:33] to be sent in something like 10 hours or
[128:35] so
[128:38] uh so usually when you import images you
[128:42] especially since they're above the fold
[128:45] um so that's you you know you might not
[128:47] you might want to Google to like your
[128:49] site so uh it's good to import them

[133:08] sucks
[133:11] my resolution maybe images they have
[133:13] something
[133:14] fresh into the winners
[133:19] oh
[133:21] that's my wife she's featured no way
[133:27] how come in four years
[133:32] there's no way that's my wife four years
[133:34] ago she didn't even she was not even on
[133:36] the platform but they use her picture
[133:40] what the [ __ ]
[133:44] that is so strange this is a four years
[133:46] ago video
[133:47] my wife is on the picture
[133:51] but she's not in the video
[133:53] what is going on
[133:55] um all right anyway we need we need a
[133:58] little cute SVG uh that says like the
[134:01] leaf uh I don't know how you call that
[134:03] but uh whatever
[134:06] tasting here we need something similar
[134:08] that says top one teacher itoki 2022
[134:13] something like this
[134:16] and ideally the logo of italki
[134:22] so a word badge SVG Maybe
[134:27] you guys know anything if you have any
[134:29] idea where I could find a component like
[134:31] this
[134:37] if your game use that [ __ ] I love it
[134:39] yeah if you know any
[134:40] like the leaves the two leaves on the
[134:43] side uh the ability to add some text to
[134:46] one person teacher an Ito key and then
[134:48] the logo of the app
[134:51] that would be dope
[134:56] let's see if I get something here on the
[134:58] pigma
[134:59] currency file
[135:01] e-commerce Finance food
[135:07] like a metal or something
[135:09] or maybe
[135:10] a gym
[135:14] and then top one teacher ituki and then
[135:17] the logo
[135:19] of I took you underneath
[135:21] we could try something here
[135:27] let's see yay but it's red red on red
[135:31] not sure
[135:34] oh maybe we take this one then
[135:42] let's see how that looks
[135:44] are we gonna look like [ __ ] though
[135:47] I took it
[135:53] I download Vector key we're gonna put it
[135:55] in here
[135:57] and we're going to put that in the hero
[136:00] section above
[136:03] here
[136:07] are we going to need um
[136:12] I told key
[136:15] for another person
[136:19] hope that's the one
[136:22] I'm gonna figure it out yep that's not
[136:24] the one
[136:26] I took it PNG this time
[136:31] so we're gonna use the figma thing
[136:38] most of the designs I do when I don't
[136:40] know what I'm going to create like now
[136:42] no idea how it's going to look like I
[136:44] just take the components I spread them
[136:46] somewhere on the sides and then
[136:49] is going to look like [ __ ] at first so I
[136:51] removed something I had something else
[136:52] and at the end it looks something like
[136:53] normal something that you you you could
[136:56] watch and understand
[136:57] this is what I'm going to do here
[137:02] uh with eight maybe eight
[137:06] wait what is that
[137:09] and and we're gonna say we need to fill
[137:12] uh
[137:15] uh what do we want to fill this
[137:18] maybe accent color
[137:29] hey it's gonna say okay this way
[137:35] hey why not it's a bit a bit hard to see
[137:38] though
[137:39] uh
[137:40] we don't need to spend too much time on
[137:42] this
[137:43] and close this
[137:45] I can add some text like uh one percent
[137:53] high top one person
[137:58] feature
[138:09] then also we need an image
[138:16] it's a toky
[138:21] I need all that
[138:28] okay with I'm gonna say randomly but
[138:30] that's probably about it
[138:32] it's okay and source
[138:39] okay the menu is there wow
[138:42] I was there I took you oh there's a
[138:44] white background okay that looks like
[138:46] [ __ ]
[138:50] maybe we don't need the gym
[139:05] oh that could be
[139:07] I think
[139:08] it's okay could look good on there
[139:13] okay that's dope
[139:16] let's see how well that does for this
[139:18] little logo shouldn't be too hard I
[139:20] think
[139:28] it looks like it did pretty well
[139:32] yeah it's pretty well I think that
[139:33] should be enough for
[139:35] well that's uh
[139:38] yeah
[139:40] thank you buddy does pretty well
[139:45] foreign
[139:57] oh I think I think I know okay if we
[140:00] make it smaller
[140:04] uh and make
[140:08] yep there we go
[140:10] and then we're gonna do this
[140:14] we're going to throw that in a div class
[140:17] Flex
[140:19] you have two items Center
[140:32] oh
[140:33] if
[140:37] Eve
[140:41] if we make this very small
[140:45] in the div
[140:49] ision teacher
[140:59] that's a tricky one because I need to I
[141:01] really need to show the platform that's
[141:03] there because it's important that's
[141:05] where students they know that
[141:52] or maybe
[141:54] oh I think I know I think I'm just going
[141:55] to put a picture of my wife
[142:01] if someone Tunes in in the Stream right
[142:05] now
[142:09] well I think I'm just gonna put a
[142:10] picture of my wife that would be really
[142:11] awkward
[142:19] what if I put a picture on a baby that's
[142:35] maybe I add a picture of her I said one
[142:39] G teacher or something like her name
[142:41] underneath the gym what's up one person
[142:43] teacher on ituki
[142:55] I took one percent and drop by
[143:01] when you say okay
[143:02] that's true just tough one percent
[143:04] teacher
[143:06] the one percent teacher
[143:08] on it okay
[143:43] [Music]
[143:51] a point percent feature on italki
[143:59] there should be there should be a
[144:02] picture
[144:02] of her
[144:11] now that can actually be fun
[144:15] yeah I'm just not a big uh Tech guy with
[144:19] uh me Journey so I
[144:21] I wouldn't know how to make it but that
[144:22] would be actually fun I think she would
[144:24] love it
[144:55] um
[145:06] there
[145:07] are designed forward
[145:13] I'm stuck with these little components
[145:16] because I don't even know what I'm
[145:17] trying to design actually
[145:39] without this uh I
[146:09] suck
[147:14] maybe we can try this
[147:16] um leaves
[147:29] I think I do have them somewhere
[147:31] actually
[147:33] oh yeah here
[147:35] pretty fast
[147:44] you trade this uh
[147:46] [Music]
[147:50] we passed this thing here
[147:55] and remove the black
[148:04] here we go
[148:07] let's say class name width of
[148:11] X base
[148:16] and 60.
[148:19] oh field based content
[148:22] okay
[148:27] up
[148:28] um I think it's better to have than
[148:34] I think we're just gonna see
[148:36] 25 or 30 I mean 30 40 maybe yeah
[148:41] here we gonna
[148:43] but oh she needs to a skill maybe scale
[148:47] one
[148:50] back
[148:58] I'm gonna let I'm gonna do something in
[149:00] here I just have to play around
[149:03] yeah no 180.
[149:07] that was a good try
[149:12] oh boom here we go
[149:17] that's uh Flex item Center
[149:23] I get maybe two items Center justify
[149:26] Center
[149:32] maybe we actually we don't need any Gap
[149:34] here
[149:38] it closed it
[149:43] um being a bingo bingo
[149:45] we can move the italki part a little bit
[149:48] lower than this
[149:52] where is it
[149:54] like items here
[149:57] you can move it here
[150:15] [Music]
[150:19] maybe we don't need any Gap as well
[150:38] maybe we've removed the gym
[150:48] oh we make it much smaller
[150:50] or just a little bit smaller
[151:05] all right that's not the most beautiful
[151:07] component but it seems like it's working
[151:11] maybe we can make this a little bit
[151:13] bigger
[151:16] one
[151:30] and maybe I need to do because now it's
[151:33] kind of sound weird
[151:34] light up
[151:44] yeah it could be this way the floor
[151:50] energy Space Center uh we are on a
[151:56] covered Maybe
[152:00] item start is that
[152:16] oh you know that's the wrong one yeah
[152:18] here it is
[152:20] LG
[152:23] a items
[152:31] area that looks more since
[152:37] all right I think these needs to be
[152:38] closer to the headline
[152:44] my teacher on it okay tag
[152:47] we're going to throw some little dirty
[152:49] stuff make it easy
[152:52] just gonna do negative margins
[152:59] and on LG MD
[153:03] margin buttons negative margin button
[153:06] okay
[153:09] all right
[153:10] I think we have a hero sections
[153:14] this is an ace thank you Daniel
[153:22] husband approved
[153:27] it current Made Easy okay
[153:30] all right we we will need decimals a
[153:33] bunch of them because
[153:35] persons and really lovely messages
[153:39] a PDF review where are they oh yeah
[153:42] they're there
[153:51] let's say putty we can say Andrew yeah
[153:53] we're gonna make Penny to small
[153:54] testimonials kind of easy your story
[153:56] I'll fully improved first okay
[154:00] we're gonna get to the testimonial one
[154:01] and instead of that's a generic girl
[154:04] winner import we're importing Patty
[154:09] um let's see the jpeg
[154:12] a seminal from
[154:17] gonna go here
[154:19] pretty helpful and here we need to
[154:22] replace
[154:23] all right
[154:25] amigo
[154:28] food and a lot of Hearts we don't need
[154:31] to show any
[154:32] logo
[154:36] or we can show italki logo
[154:47] I should be sure I took it logo no maybe
[154:49] we shouldn't that doesn't really matter
[154:51] my teeth
[154:57] learning Korean
[155:00] one plus
[155:02] here whatever that might need to change
[155:05] later
[155:12] right
[155:14] so we have a cute little testimony here
[155:17] very nice
[155:20] yeah it looks pretty cool
[155:23] I think I'm gonna reverse the rotation
[155:29] we're gonna say just rotate one
[155:36] or I'm gonna reverse this one
[155:48] okay I current Made Easy joined Korean
[155:51] uh we need a feature
[155:54] we were here I'm gonna commit that uh
[155:58] first
[156:00] whatever
[156:02] we need features
[156:04] um
[156:05] and yeah features are two things
[156:08] weekly PDF and the community stuff
[156:11] for the weekly PDF we're going to show
[156:14] more pictures of the PDF I think maybe a
[156:16] carousel feature
[156:17] I love to use Daisy uis for that they
[156:19] just make it so simple
[156:22] I believe they have a carousel
[156:31] they do
[156:34] this could actually be nice probably
[156:37] carousel
[156:39] should should it be
[156:42] what should we display
[156:45] I think
[156:47] he said that they are
[156:58] struggling with
[157:04] oh
[157:08] oh I think I can reuse that
[157:15] oh I think I have a components
[157:17] I should add this to the boilerplate
[157:19] where is it
[157:23] make lending where are you you're here
[157:25] make Landing
[157:26] how it works I believe this is how it
[157:29] works
[157:33] I think this one
[157:38] right this is going to be a a test here
[157:42] no idea how they're gonna look like
[157:45] um so we're going to create a new
[157:46] component called feature
[157:49] um book PDF
[157:53] but yes I'm gonna throw the code that
[157:56] I've already done for my cleaning
[157:59] and here is gonna be very not happy but
[158:04] I'm gonna try anyway
[158:06] God damn it
[158:09] I'm using the wrong project here
[158:12] I'm working on Indie page shipping new
[158:15] feature for Indie page
[158:17] uh components here
[158:21] features PDF
[158:23] cheers
[158:26] throw this in there
[158:27] and we're going to downtown
[158:34] orange features
[158:37] you don't find it
[158:39] you don't like it maybe
[158:41] oh because I think it's called how it
[158:43] works
[158:48] here's PDF
[158:56] yeah there you go
[158:58] testimonials and then it features PDF
[159:02] and yep he's not happy of course
[159:09] oh yeah I need so I think I'll need four
[159:11] pictures
[159:16] of the PDF that she made we have them
[159:20] here again
[159:23] um
[159:24] let me watch let me see again so
[159:30] yeah I think that those are the features
[159:31] you get so tailored exercises progress
[159:33] tracking real life conversation grammar
[159:36] practice
[159:37] so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm
[159:39] going to show the features that you get
[159:41] in the PDF so a
[159:43] screenshot of the PDF that shows the
[159:45] exact feature
[159:46] how the feature is going to help you and
[159:48] what is the video you're doing
[159:50] I need to find whatever four three four
[159:53] it's not even English two three or four
[159:56] images that shows that
[160:00] I might ask more oh maybe we have it
[160:03] here
[160:06] this that's a different stuff
[160:12] okay conjugation
[160:14] uh conjugation or in verbs
[160:18] all right I can't I can still change the
[160:20] picture later uh she can send me more
[160:22] picture
[160:25] if you can sell this type of country
[160:27] what features we have again we have
[160:30] tailored exercise progress I know yeah
[160:33] that really doesn't matter I'm gonna
[160:34] call them whatever
[160:36] and say conjugation
[160:42] adjectives
[161:02] uh translation whatever I'm gonna put
[161:05] three for now watching adjective
[161:09] could be best in there
[161:12] I'm not gonna use
[161:16] we don't need that
[161:18] we need to remove this like creation
[161:29] uh at least a JPEG I think
[161:35] pegs
[161:40] up up
[161:41] [Music]
[161:44] contribution what else do we have
[161:47] um
[161:50] translation and adjectives
[161:56] translation
[162:05] a of course this is not working it works
[162:09] with video remove it
[162:11] we can also
[162:14] oh yeah I think this is in the steps
[162:20] translation
[162:25] adjectives
[162:27] and we can remove the fourth
[162:29] it should be working now
[162:32] yeah okay this is what we have so
[162:38] here is a component that I use for make
[162:40] lending
[162:41] um I don't use it anymore
[162:43] but I can reuse it for this project uh
[162:45] it looks I need to fix the
[162:47] size and stuff but basically it goes
[162:50] like this like you have a couple it can
[162:53] be either like a one two three four five
[162:54] steps or you can just be like the
[162:57] headline like you know whatever this is
[162:59] you get here and then you explain and
[163:00] when you click it opens the description
[163:02] and you also get to see the picture
[163:05] related to that
[163:07] uh
[163:09] yeah if you guys think that should end
[163:12] up in the ship pass boilerplate you let
[163:13] me know
[163:15] between the Precision
[163:17] nice buddy nice good night man thanks
[163:20] for joining and thanks for the tips
[163:25] and hey Nate um 100 made with my or
[163:29] design skills but thank you so much for
[163:31] your your kind words
[163:33] between my best here
[163:41] but a baseball contains
[163:46] gold
[163:48] all right that's better from semi bold
[163:52] and the headline should be
[163:55] much bigger
[164:01] extra bold okay we're gonna go for it
[164:04] extra bold
[164:08] and we're gonna say something like a
[164:17] are we gonna say something like a
[164:21] daily
[164:29] Pawn or something
[164:35] describe your project
[164:40] um what are we going to do here
[164:42] we're gonna say
[164:44] uh
[164:46] we're gonna take what my wife sends
[164:48] tailored exercises
[164:56] oh maybe instead of a
[164:59] a very bold simple
[165:02] counter
[165:05] like number one two indexes maybe I can
[165:07] I can use icons to make it a little bit
[165:09] cuter that would fit
[165:12] yeah that would be better
[165:17] so where is that thing
[165:20] data we can remove that
[165:23] I think
[165:24] instead we can do SVG
[165:28] for tailored exercises we're gonna go to
[165:30] Hero icon oh no I know what I'm going to
[165:33] use this is going to be so much better
[165:35] this Library tailored exercises we have
[165:38] to find
[165:44] and that's cute
[165:45] I'm gonna use some of those emojis or or
[165:48] SVG sorry
[165:49] to describe what you get
[165:53] um
[165:56] I think the tailored exercise could
[165:58] really fit well with this little cute
[166:00] heart
[166:01] thingy
[166:08] let's do it
[166:10] anyway the wife will give her last word
[166:14] and she'll decide whether
[166:16] something
[166:18] here is appealing
[166:22] uh yeah you don't like it why
[166:26] okay because of the coma
[166:32] um
[166:46] maybe we're gonna say with
[166:48] six eight
[166:51] six and we are going to say the deal
[166:57] um secondary I think it was a beautiful
[166:59] color
[167:03] and he instead here I'm going to remove
[167:05] that and say
[167:17] a uh
[167:19] the data Dot
[167:23] no that's hvg
[167:27] oh yeah it has to be in line
[167:34] and it has to be it has to be legs
[167:41] legs items
[167:44] there
[167:49] is it already no
[167:53] strange
[167:58] is it
[168:09] a team Center it takes bit get two
[168:13] that's the center
[168:16] okay
[168:19] it looks High
[168:29] alrighty
[168:40] the descriptions will be this
[168:51] okay
[168:53] and the next one would be
[168:56] progress tracking
[168:58] so for that
[169:02] I'm gonna go here first right thing
[169:05] we're going to use test for knowledge
[169:07] and track your growth we're using your
[169:08] quizzes every week
[169:13] and we're gonna use
[169:19] progress tracking what can we use for
[169:21] that
[169:22] maybe this progress
[169:26] qr1
[169:34] or this
[169:38] I think this icon is a bit better
[169:41] see what else we have after
[169:43] real life conversation grammar practice
[169:47] okay we can take this one
[169:56] SVG
[169:58] [Music]
[170:02] we have this cute thing here we're going
[170:06] to do the exact same thing
[170:08] I could probably automate that but
[170:10] anyway
[170:11] oh yeah we need to remove let's build
[170:13] black
[170:15] Brokers tracking tailored exercises
[170:18] a little bit more
[170:21] streaming
[170:23] maybe if it's a four
[170:26] okay that three was nice
[170:29] and finally
[170:32] finally finally we need the latest one
[170:35] and remove one I think oh yeah we've
[170:38] already removed it
[170:39] into this one
[170:45] we're gonna go for real life
[170:46] conversations
[170:55] up
[170:57] and that is gonna be here
[171:02] conversation that could be a speech
[171:03] bubble or something oh Bow there we go
[171:08] a PS SVG
[171:10] and we're gonna pass it here
[171:12] and call it a day
[171:16] build like we'll remove it
[171:22] at least for react
[171:24] and we're going to use that
[171:28] here we go
[171:30] that's cute
[171:33] copy rating is not done yet but I'm
[171:37] gonna review this with my wife again and
[171:38] try to improve those
[171:41] another thing here
[171:44] this is what you get so
[171:46] uh I think I can keep using the same
[171:49] pattern for the pictures not uh that
[171:51] we've done it for the others and just
[171:54] have a
[171:57] um
[172:01] yeah have a little border and those kind
[172:04] of things around
[172:05] it makes a lot of sense
[172:08] um features PDF
[172:10] I think the image is
[172:14] images here
[172:16] I think we need to cover this with that
[172:20] and we need to
[172:23] do a workbook a
[172:26] picture or
[172:28] in
[172:33] you can blur it if you want
[172:40] to be here yeah
[172:42] I think we can go
[172:54] yeah I think it's a bit too small
[172:57] uh yeah just like earlier we're gonna
[173:00] put this
[173:02] and we're gonna say SM Maybe
[173:15] now we're gonna remove oh maybe we keep
[173:17] the rotation why not
[173:20] no it's kind of weird okay I remove it
[173:25] and this component has to be structured
[173:30] okay we have the pictures maybe I'm
[173:34] going to add another one
[173:36] uh grammar practice
[173:40] then build a strong foundation and
[173:42] grammar [ __ ] yeah
[173:50] or
[174:01] hey
[174:03] yep
[174:05] we go with with whiz
[174:08] we need the figma we need grammar maybe
[174:11] a pen a pen would be nice someone
[174:13] writing something
[174:15] I find it
[174:21] what could it be from my grandma grammar
[174:42] I wish I could search oh maybe I could
[174:44] search and
[174:47] the hope
[174:49] Ah that's dope
[174:58] nice
[175:07] hey
[175:09] I use the same settings angle
[175:12] a path
[175:16] and we're going to remove the fill neck
[175:18] and there we go
[175:22] all right because he's my wife I'm gonna
[175:24] have to do the fifth okay
[175:27] here we go so we have a full package
[175:40] it will reuse it
[175:43] um vocabulary what could we have
[175:48] a card
[175:52] not a credit card
[175:54] um vocabulary maybe speech I don't know
[175:56] but we'll speech we already use it
[175:58] you see if there's something that
[176:00] someone know
[176:01] um
[176:05] book at least
[176:06] or just a book Maybe
[176:14] all right
[176:15] I'm gonna go with this
[176:35] what what did I do
[176:40] oh okay yeah
[176:43] we're getting
[176:44] and
[176:46] getting there
[176:55] all right here we go we have five
[176:58] features that can be displayed here
[177:03] um I think my wife will need to change
[177:05] some of them to make it easier typically
[177:08] what you would do is
[177:10] foreign
[177:12] you would
[177:14] um no one has time to read this
[177:16] so you would take a screenshot like you
[177:20] would do that something like that
[177:23] and just use that instead
[177:27] so it's much clearer people can
[177:29] understand right away like okay this is
[177:30] what I get because this is really like
[177:32] this massive block of like image here is
[177:36] really hard to read so yeah wife will
[177:38] have to work on this later
[177:40] but yeah we have a feature
[177:42] I think we have a yeah
[177:44] a feature stuff and then what we can do
[177:47] is we can take another testimonial like
[177:49] she did here
[177:52] and just edits
[177:54] to the to just after it so
[177:59] uh oh wait we're gonna have to rename
[178:01] that
[178:03] um testimono one
[178:06] I could make ah
[178:10] I could make a react component
[178:13] uh that I can reuse but that would be
[178:15] over
[178:17] thinking for this specific parts
[178:22] instead I'm just gonna do this
[178:25] and I'm gonna do here I'm going to
[178:27] remove a t I'm gonna say
[178:30] and we're going to use Mr Andrew
[178:34] for the next testimonial
[178:38] we have the features we have
[178:41] to have Andrew that I need to create
[178:45] and do testimonial Andrew which I guess
[178:57] uh Yep this could be confusing
[179:05] right here at testimony Andrew
[179:10] and so here we're going to replace Petty
[179:12] by Andrew
[179:16] on here it's probably just a capital
[179:19] here either
[179:22] of course here neither
[179:25] and we're gonna check what Andrew said
[179:29] um
[179:31] Andrew said I like the user General
[179:33] reinforce my current job sometimes for
[179:36] me studying okay maybe we have to clip
[179:37] it a little bit because it might be a
[179:39] little bit long
[179:45] the r and Drew learning Korean for uh
[179:48] six months
[179:51] I have no idea for that I'm gonna have
[179:53] to ask my wife again
[179:57] so what we got
[180:00] Bingo okay that's a big testimonial
[180:02] maybe we have to remove the I like the
[180:03] use of Korean journal the currency range
[180:05] Improvement my current characters I've
[180:06] noticed ah that is good
[180:09] now we can okay what we can do is when
[180:11] you have a big testimonial like this
[180:14] uh
[180:17] you can
[180:19] wrap it in a div
[180:23] you can say something like I don't know
[180:25] EG primary or something just something
[180:28] to highlight
[180:30] obey accident okay I know what oh why
[180:32] actually that's quite nice
[180:43] yeah we can do this to change a bit and
[180:45] my current characters have noticed
[180:51] and thanks for listening it can be hard
[180:53] to actually apply what I'm learning
[180:54] makes the learning
[180:59] all right my wife will have the final
[181:01] word again but I think it needs to be
[181:03] shortened just a little bit
[181:05] maybe one sentence list
[181:07] um sometimes we are playing we're just
[181:08] memorizing yeah I think she'll give
[181:11] feedback okay so this is what we get so
[181:13] far
[181:14] uh we have a landing page uh that's not
[181:18] finished but close to B
[181:20] um copy needs to be Rewritten by the
[181:21] wife but it's kind of here uh we have
[181:24] testimonials that are set up here we
[181:26] have feature showcase about how the
[181:29] workbook works
[181:30] uh you can click and you see different
[181:32] pictures of what you can expect to have
[181:34] another testimonial we need another
[181:36] feature section in between here
[181:38] and then
[181:40] probably another testimonial again and
[181:43] then the pricing here that is almost set
[181:45] up I just need to change what's in there
[181:47] I think I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna remake
[181:49] the pricing because it's monthly and
[181:50] yearly so I'm going to make one price
[181:52] section with one toggle button to go for
[181:54] yearly or monthly
[181:57] and and yeah it probably finished with
[181:59] an FAQ or another testimonial and will
[182:01] be ready to move on for the second part
[182:03] which is uh
[182:04] building the user dashboard
[182:11] yeah Legend man thank you so much for
[182:14] being here
[182:14] I appreciate it oh
[182:17] so fun one of my favorite YouTuber
[182:20] Watching Me on YouTube that's uh I feel
[182:22] like I've I've made it you know
[182:30] let's see ready
[182:33] oh okay maybe I miss type Petty but it's
[182:35] probably only in the code which should
[182:37] be fine
[182:40] okay we should be good with that
[182:42] all right we're going to have a mini
[182:44] break mini croissant break
[182:50] it's my lunch
[182:54] thank you buddy I'm uh inviting you to
[182:57] my uh
[182:58] my French time this is my uh this is my
[183:01] lunch
[183:02] I would normally never eat this just for
[183:05] lunch but you know I found out for the
[183:07] stream it would actually be well I hope
[183:08] you had a good uh
[183:10] a good time off I say your pictures of
[183:12] you running
[183:13] because you're working on during
[183:14] holidays
[183:24] that's
[183:26] that looks good
[183:38] oh I think that's um
[183:39] it's a croissant with chocolate
[183:43] and almonds
[183:45] it's
[183:46] not much
[183:48] it's already worth a day of streaming
[183:51] I'm based in Bali Indonesia
[183:57] so I'm kind of far away from my home
[184:01] food
[184:02] that's why on weekends
[184:04] I would go for
[184:07] red food
[184:14] okay it's my first
[184:26] if you do let me know
[184:29] do you live in Bucharest or was just
[184:31] just for holidays
[185:04] all right
[185:06] it's funny I've never I've never heard
[185:07] of the city name let me Google that
[185:16] oh okay
[185:29] oh lovely
[185:44] I lose I keep finding yourself a
[185:45] beautiful city
[185:47] looks calm and quiet and green looks
[185:49] really green actually
[185:58] the Silicon Valley of Romania
[186:01] March yeah I'll be I'll be in Bali I'll
[186:03] be here for the next two years
[186:05] so um anytime you come I'll be around
[186:07] and
[186:08] and in two years we are planning to do a
[186:12] Europe trip with a van
[186:14] for like a year or something build like
[186:16] a I don't know whatever starting or
[186:17] something to work and we'll definitely
[186:20] come around uh where you leave and and
[186:23] all around uh
[186:25] all around Europe
[186:48] that'll be fun buddy
[187:07] all right I think
[187:10] we can go back
[187:22] I need to remove that I mean if you do
[187:24] another change
[187:28] it would be very creating a small group
[187:40] [Music]
[187:44] yeah this is not the best testimonial
[187:55] I might swap Petty
[188:01] ah there we go Erie now raging Korean
[188:04] that is good
[188:09] that is very good okay
[188:46] okay
[188:48] um so I'm gonna swept I'm sorry buddy
[188:53] but uh I think Andrew's testimonial is
[188:56] actually closer to
[188:58] what we want uh we want to see some kind
[189:01] of like someone who's changed someone
[189:03] who
[189:04] um you know for someone for who it was
[189:06] so helpful
[189:09] that uh we need to change it so we're
[189:12] gonna do
[189:14] 30 and I think it's Eerie now
[189:21] okay hearing aids back and we are going
[189:24] to use uh usually I'm using enough time
[189:26] we're talking about words
[189:32] okay that's a very long testimonial as
[189:34] well
[189:36] we might have to clip some parts of it
[189:43] eventually speaking Korean and that's
[189:45] exactly what people want
[189:49] so
[189:51] hey come on V is good
[189:54] okay
[189:55] and that's extremely long wow
[190:00] all right I think I found something we
[190:02] could oh that would be dope
[190:06] we're gonna add Korean a little bit
[190:07] everywhere on the page
[190:11] and we're gonna use a different typeface
[190:13] to make it really pop up
[190:17] so
[190:27] the Curry's ready
[190:30] okay so maybe we can do this remove that
[190:33] part
[190:37] and do something like this maybe
[190:39] feel a little bit long
[190:43] I remember the I remember the correct
[190:45] writing and the common vocabs
[190:55] yeah as a current learner there's also
[190:58] something I can relate
[191:01] so I remember the correct ring or the
[191:03] common vocals because it's really hard
[191:06] to remember Korean words because they
[191:08] have nothing in common with my language
[191:10] French or English
[191:13] and what she says
[191:16] is something I can relate
[191:18] so I'm gonna highlight it and put it in
[191:20] there
[191:22] and for the testimonial for Andrew we're
[191:25] gonna keep it like the from interest I
[191:27] like the journal trees and for the my
[191:29] Korean as if
[191:30] maybe I can do this
[191:35] sometimes for me sitting memorizing can
[191:37] be hard so actually applying what I'm
[191:39] learning makes that learning much faster
[191:40] for me
[191:45] okay we're gonna cut this part as well
[191:47] so it's a bit short and sweet
[191:50] all right we have two beautiful
[191:51] testimonials
[191:54] we have the B weekly workbooks to
[191:56] improve your Korean your current while
[191:58] having fun progress tracking Taylor
[192:00] exercise your left exercise
[192:02] all right that is good
[192:04] that is good
[192:05] um
[192:06] now we need
[192:09] we need the group thing
[192:11] so I'm going to show you a picture
[192:13] students
[192:17] uh no I see in the binder students who
[192:20] are in the group here can chat
[192:25] yeah there we go
[192:27] oh that is nice they even sent pictures
[192:28] of Their Own
[192:31] oh that's pretty cool they speak Korean
[192:33] in there
[192:35] oh wow
[192:37] I'm discovering what my wife is doing as
[192:39] a job
[192:44] so maybe we can
[192:45] oh
[192:49] all right I think someone in the chat
[192:50] earlier since a component by Taylor win
[192:54] UI I think we can get inspired with it
[192:57] and do something
[192:59] um
[192:59] in the same layout let me show you what
[193:02] I have in mind
[193:04] so to highlight the community feature I
[193:07] want to show a picture of these chats
[193:10] that eventually maybe I can embed into a
[193:13] mock-up of a phone so it shows like oh
[193:16] you know it's like you you have the
[193:17] group on your phone and you can chat
[193:18] with people
[193:20] in a format that's uh
[193:23] looks like a
[193:29] internet is slowed down
[193:31] someone tell me we're still alive
[193:37] um recharge
[193:38] oh I can write
[193:46] okay I can write recharge yeah I think
[193:48] it has been sent
[193:49] Richard man is really beautiful actually
[193:51] that's what I use for Indie page
[193:54] this is my Indie page where I have all
[193:58] my websites
[194:00] and for the stats I use recharge
[194:04] and this is very simple to do
[194:08] and it just look cool
[194:10] looks Pro
[194:11] in the recharge
[194:14] um and you oh your name in
[194:17] good to have you here buddy
[194:19] um with what I'm building I'm building
[194:20] the links in this description uh it's a
[194:22] e-learning platform for my wife to uh
[194:25] exchange learning materials with their
[194:27] students
[194:28] monthly subscriptions with stripe 49 a
[194:30] month and email sending for the
[194:33] transactions and all that okay we're
[194:35] going to use that
[194:36] oh how does it look okay that looks like
[194:39] face and mobile
[194:42] okay we have some time so I'm going to
[194:43] build these components instead of it's
[194:44] not going to be a testimonial but it's
[194:46] going to be here on the left a mock-up
[194:47] of a phone
[194:49] that shows the WhatsApp conversation
[194:50] that people are having the community
[194:52] feature and here I'm gonna put whatever
[194:55] like you know chat with other Korean
[194:57] Learners and improve naturally your
[194:59] language or something
[195:01] so
[195:03] I bet this thing here is absolutely
[195:06] positioned
[195:08] I think
[195:11] I don't know
[195:27] are we gonna try
[195:29] uh and we're gonna call it feature
[195:32] chats GS
[195:37] oh yeah we need to fix also the heading
[195:40] here
[195:41] adding yep
[195:44] okay here it's have to be eight
[195:49] yeah that makes more sense now okay that
[195:51] looks better
[196:06] um
[196:12] what can we use
[196:15] feature that
[196:20] up
[196:23] Twitter just maybe we're going to reuse
[196:25] the layout of the testimonial this thing
[196:29] yeah
[196:31] okay
[196:32] throw it in there
[196:41] and keep the thing BG bass it's gonna be
[196:45] neutral I guess
[196:50] I Think You're Expecting y oh no okay
[196:52] yeah this has to go some wait let's see
[196:57] let's see let's see
[196:58] um
[197:00] X page
[197:02] reports
[197:04] hit your chat
[197:06] why Community bro why
[197:10] you had one job
[197:13] could have been
[197:17] uh and we're gonna throw it
[197:21] here
[197:28] get your chat okay
[197:30] teaching that PG natural
[197:35] um
[197:36] related feature chats
[197:39] so we're supposed to have
[197:41] uh some description like H2
[197:47] uh did my wife call that
[197:54] committee support and challenges okay
[198:08] I'm gonna do class
[198:10] um next
[198:12] these
[198:14] contents 80.
[198:17] leading relaxed
[198:20] a
[198:21] here we're gonna do next three x maybe
[198:25] we can just reuse what I did for the
[198:26] testimonial oh no maybe for the Future
[198:29] Part
[198:30] it's your PDF
[198:32] and we gotta reuse that thing
[198:37] and we need a little bit less margin
[198:40] maybe eight
[198:43] four
[198:46] oh yeah we need to change the text uh
[198:51] yeah okay I need to move that and do
[198:53] opacity
[198:54] 80.
[198:57] text neutral confidence that will be
[199:00] square
[199:05] neutral content
[199:09] right
[199:11] this is what we have and now I need to
[199:15] have
[199:17] that
[199:19] that thing here
[199:21] a big thing
[199:24] so should I maybe I don't even need to
[199:28] maybe we don't even need to put it in
[199:29] the mock-up maybe we just put the
[199:31] screenshot of it
[199:32] let's put a screenshot and see how that
[199:34] goes
[199:35] and we can use
[199:39] I think I'll I'll ask my wife to make a
[199:41] better image I don't I have a feeling
[199:43] this is not gonna look good for some
[199:46] reason like too small or something
[199:50] I think a screenshot of a phone like a
[199:52] literally like a
[199:55] yeah a phone would look better
[200:01] okay
[200:05] [Music]
[200:09] image
[200:12] that's
[200:15] almost
[200:18] and we are going to
[200:39] face content I think I need to fix that
[200:55] community
[201:02] and here we're going to say what is this
[201:04] not yet
[201:07] how does it look now
[201:11] okay always the same problem
[201:21] Max with uh maybe SM
[201:26] and on LG we're going to do Max with
[201:29] LG
[201:42] we need to fix the borders though
[201:45] order based contents uh neutral content
[201:48] Maybe
[201:52] all right that's better yeah that's much
[201:53] better okay I need to fix that
[201:57] um size with
[202:08] the look we have it here that looks crap
[202:12] for now
[202:13] okay but we're going to fix that
[202:16] by
[202:19] so we know the
[202:22] the bigger size will be maybe this MD
[202:28] maybe LG
[202:38] and we need to push that thing here
[202:44] I'm not sure what I'm doing so I'm gonna
[202:46] I'm gonna throw everything in the D
[202:48] let's say it's an absolute div
[202:51] and we're gonna say on mobile
[202:54] we're gonna do
[202:57] uh
[202:59] lift
[203:01] 1.5 Translate
[203:06] thanks
[203:08] [Music]
[203:09] yep I think that's it to be in the
[203:12] center
[203:13] translate thanks
[203:17] okay that's in the center now I need to
[203:20] put it on the top
[203:22] and at the top it's gonna be uh I'll be
[203:26] how high is it
[203:32] okay it's like kind of like one third
[203:39] oh it's just weird because they have a
[203:41] picture that could look well so maybe oh
[203:43] okay I know I need to change
[203:47] I only need to change this but I'll do
[203:48] I'll do some top one third
[203:53] is it one-third
[203:55] it looks like one-fourth one one and a
[203:57] half here
[204:04] that looks weird
[204:06] this position relative anyway it doesn't
[204:09] matter
[204:13] we can do something like this
[204:15] uh
[204:16] yeah to make it safe I probably going to
[204:20] wrap
[204:21] this and that
[204:23] another div
[204:27] and do
[204:30] merging y 24
[204:34] .
[204:43] um
[204:54] this one yeah
[205:00] yeah okay that's better
[205:04] um
[205:10] okay I'm gonna do the classic CSS stuff
[205:13] the border from Red 500
[205:19] um order
[205:21] red yellow
[205:24] and here we're gonna throw a border
[205:27] Eve
[205:32] order a green iron
[205:35] you have a little blue oh maybe we're
[205:38] gonna do blue
[205:40] okay yeah that's what we have
[205:53] I think we can remove that
[205:57] and I think the size will be determined
[206:00] by the top layer
[206:03] probably something like the weight
[206:09] and then
[206:14] you kind of wanna
[206:18] kind of want to have
[206:31] if we do something like this just to try
[206:33] what would happen
[206:37] yep
[206:57] is it um
[207:01] it's going back
[207:03] hello
[207:04] Ard fishery yeah buddy
[207:13] oh everyone
[207:18] yeah I will try to embed in the site in
[207:20] a phone I just try first to see how that
[207:22] looks because the program with the phone
[207:24] is that on mobile device is going to be
[207:26] really weird here I would have to put
[207:28] the phone in portrait mode
[207:30] so I think uh I would probably go
[207:33] without it actually to eat to avoid you
[207:35] know doing some fancy uh or or hard CSS
[207:40] stuff
[207:42] if that makes sense
[207:51] still
[207:53] oh true
[207:57] I think it
[208:00] Booth oh yeah
[208:16] oh okay
[208:28] oh maybe that's this one we need to
[208:34] oh yeah okay
[208:36] uh object
[208:40] which one is it object fit
[208:45] I'll read this yeah
[208:47] perfect better okay
[208:53] I can say 8 50 I think
[209:39] this would be
[210:40] this is not a
[210:42] talented software engineer work here
[210:46] but that is working
[210:50] I should have
[210:52] think of it deeper
[210:54] how to build these at first but since
[210:56] it's working I might just keep it this
[210:57] way uh
[210:59] [Music]
[211:02] and I think so we need to change at some
[211:04] point to small size crane to a bigger
[211:07] one like when it's probably MD like
[211:11] medium-sized screen
[211:13] we will need to have this on the left
[211:15] side so
[211:17] here
[211:19] and the we're gonna say uh
[211:23] on the left is Maybe
[211:34] oh maybe we can do something like this
[211:36] as well
[211:38] um next with the 3XL whatever
[211:45] maybe five
[211:52] maybe three I don't know
[211:59] I'm gonna start with three
[212:02] three and we're going to put it in the
[212:04] middle so MX Auto
[212:10] um
[212:11] and so yeah we're going to remove the
[212:12] rotation stuff because that's weird
[212:18] we will need to push so we will need to
[212:21] have margins on the left so
[212:24] oh yeah that's something that I learned
[212:26] recently you can do something like this
[212:27] intelliwind instead of having like
[212:30] margin top
[212:31] or REM and then MD and then have
[212:35] different margin for different stuff you
[212:37] can just do this Max
[212:40] I think it's Max MD
[212:45] yeah Max MD margin top which means until
[212:49] the medium viewport
[212:52] we're gonna apply this and after we're
[212:55] gonna have nothing applied so just make
[212:58] it much simpler then you don't have to
[213:00] write for the use case for small and
[213:02] bigger device you just write this and I
[213:04] know that this is only applied per
[213:05] device until the medium size
[213:08] and then because I have a different
[213:09] types of margin I think the margin left
[213:13] maybe whatever eight rem or something
[213:18] yeah we need some margins on the left
[213:22] and we are going to push
[213:25] Mister here we're gonna push it on the
[213:28] left
[213:29] zero
[213:31] to the top
[213:33] one and a half
[213:36] and MD oh
[213:39] uh and MD
[213:42] translates
[213:43] y
[213:46] ep one and a half
[213:49] weird stuff okay yeah it's in the middle
[213:52] so that's good
[213:53] now we need to make it uh MD 8.
[213:58] right
[214:00] right whatever
[214:03] 32 RDM Maybe
[214:07] even more than that 48.
[214:12] okay we want to get above the screen
[214:14] that's good
[214:17] we want it to be smaller
[214:21] on the width so
[214:27] uh on MD the width will be
[214:34] 80 Maybe
[214:37] it's too small
[214:40] uh 30 hour maybe not 30. I could have
[214:44] used aspect ratio that would have been
[214:45] simpler like a phone size stuff but
[215:06] I think we can remove the Border we can
[215:07] make this a bit bigger next
[215:09] 5xl
[215:12] extra bold that's good
[215:14] LG
[215:19] here we do not need
[215:26] all right it starts to look
[215:29] a bit better
[215:31] what do we have here
[215:33] this is definitely not in the middle
[215:37] hey of course Mark of course this would
[215:40] never be aligned what did you think
[215:45] uh what would be the way to fix that
[215:47] easily
[215:49] oh maybe Max MD
[215:53] absolute
[215:54] and after it's just gonna be
[215:57] a flex stuff
[216:11] I haven't know it needs to be oh yeah
[216:13] that's where I'm gonna struggle
[216:21] [ __ ]
[216:26] oh yeah that's very important as well
[216:30] how do we object position
[216:34] enter
[216:35] is there something like left
[216:38] left Center
[216:40] oh
[216:42] no idea this would work but this is
[216:44] working
[216:46] okay that's dope
[216:49] uh
[216:56] yeah there's the div is far from aligned
[216:59] and both usually use smmd or the
[217:01] breakpoint mobile desktop
[217:04] usually MD for
[217:08] usually mg for
[217:10] mobile yeah
[217:18] good night Serge
[217:35] actually it doesn't need
[217:38] to be aligned
[217:40] I think it does not really matter
[218:04] um
[218:22] I'm trying to find a quick and and dirty
[218:25] fix for this
[218:28] um
[219:06] you could throw something like
[219:08] uh
[219:23] what is going on here what did I do
[219:26] break everything work nope you didn't
[219:31] oh yes because okay yeah
[219:51] all right I'm gonna do something like
[219:52] this
[219:53] I'm gonna do this
[219:56] and take the height of this
[219:59] and do something similar there
[220:04] and do I mean 25.
[220:10] remove the Border
[220:13] next width would be an Excel too small I
[220:16] think yeah
[220:42] lift
[220:47] and then we've put it negative margin
[220:50] here
[220:56] right
[220:58] I think we can we can live with that
[221:02] maybe I'll remove a little bit of this
[221:05] thing here
[221:09] adding y
[221:11] maybe we don't need that yeah okay we
[221:14] don't need that
[221:18] oh
[221:24] yeah probably we need a little bit of
[221:26] that oh no we do we don't
[221:31] okay we don't
[221:41] all right this is not the best component
[221:43] in town
[221:47] we can stick with this
[221:53] stick with this for a while uh
[222:09] all right that's really built really
[222:11] quickly I did not think at all before
[222:14] building
[222:15] so this is a little bit too fast and too
[222:17] messy
[222:29] I think we can live with that
[222:31] oh
[222:33] that's not good
[222:37] anyway
[222:43] we have our cute little thing
[222:47] okay
[222:49] yeah I think I'll stick with this
[222:51] um
[222:53] probably you'll need
[223:20] and we need a little bit of spacing in
[223:21] here
[223:32] I just need to find out why this is not
[223:34] working as the other one
[223:37] these borders
[223:42] oh I think it's because
[223:46] probably because it's a layout field
[223:55] like this thing here
[224:03] something like this
[224:05] yeah
[224:10] yeah that's much better
[224:18] MD order two
[224:25] um this should not be rounded at all
[224:27] it should overcome
[224:33] okay
[224:37] okay not okay no I [ __ ] up that [ __ ]
[224:44] ah [ __ ] that was proud of me I was like
[224:45] yeah finally we made it and no I didn't
[224:49] um
[225:20] I'm giving up on these components
[225:23] I should have never tried to do these
[225:25] during a live stream
[225:30] Library position
[225:31] constantly through community and
[225:33] challenges
[225:35] okay consistency of community and
[225:37] challenges
[225:39] okay
[225:41] sounds good
[225:45] maybe even even be consistent
[225:50] with community and challenges maybe
[225:54] something like this
[226:07] uh
[226:41] what am I doing
[226:48] what are you doing mark
[227:07] no way
[227:11] left at 12 pixels
[227:13] um
[227:32] reverts revert revert
[227:39] what do we have here
[227:41] okay we have a little border
[228:06] oh maybe you know maybe it was not bad
[228:08] not that bad
[228:15] might do something like with
[228:58] I'm gonna throw away these components
[229:01] it's too messy
[229:18] actually did never try this
[229:21] and this one here
[229:27] all right now
[229:28] already there
[230:02] that's the spirit
[230:05] it looks ugly
[230:07] when you transition
[230:12] does it matter
[230:13] no not really
[230:18] yeah I think we are ready to move on
[230:20] with it
[230:23] the white will never know it's our
[230:26] little secret
[230:31] maybe on mobile I won't
[230:36] but when I want
[230:41] give this a little bit more space
[230:44] with margins
[230:55] and X
[231:01] oh yeah
[231:11] oh yeah okay you're not gonna make it
[231:13] okay
[231:18] okay maybe I can do the oh no wait it's
[231:20] gonna [ __ ] up the
[231:22] the borders
[231:33] all right that's dirty
[231:36] hey
[232:03] oh let me try it
[232:13] okay
[232:15] here we have
[232:16] this component was probably the the
[232:18] worst I've ever made
[232:20] but she's it's there it's there and
[232:22] working
[232:26] anyway okay
[232:30] give up on bad days okay
[232:34] well it else can help oh
[232:41] yeah this is why I dump it
[232:47] just can't oh I think it's from a guy on
[232:50] Twitter now that's good
[232:56] I think I've seen that before
[232:59] oh yeah I saw him yeah this is such a
[233:01] cool app

[241:06] I get B weekly
[241:13] get easy
[241:17] every two week gets
[241:19] comprehensive
[241:22] workbooks every two weeks
[241:27] uh
[241:28] enter
[241:31] 30 day
[241:37] we don't need to write the word here 30
[241:38] day
[241:41] challenges
[241:43] security
[241:48] I think that's pretty much the same
[241:49] those are the same
[241:51] features same plan is just one is weekly
[241:54] and one is really one is monthly
[241:57] prehensive
[242:00] security challenges or something
[242:04] okay
[242:10] it's a bit better
[242:12] um
[242:30] okay
[242:46] right
[242:47] I have to go in the bed
[242:49] coming from the bed
[243:18] okay
[243:20] it's getting cozy in here
[243:35] we have this thing uh
[243:39] the pricing plan
[243:43] I think we'll need a constant is
[243:47] eerily
[243:50] holes
[243:59] we don't need that
[244:02] yes we don't eat that as well
[244:11] oh no that's supposed to be in the
[244:13] pricing stuff here
[244:31] um
[244:31] okay we don't need uh we don't need to
[244:35] map over the plans we just need one
[244:39] here
[244:44] and we need to do this constant plan
[244:53] and configure the plans
[244:56] that is
[244:58] purity
[245:16] if truck no it's not the implants trip
[245:19] hoping that's right I think
[245:21] yeah it should be working now
[245:24] okay we have this plan here
[245:27] we need a little toggle so I think I
[245:29] built it for
[245:31] Mike lending again
[245:35] um in the pricing page I think
[245:39] easily I think I removed this damn it
[245:43] all right so we're just gonna go to
[245:45] Daisy UI

[251:46] are you gonna shelter react or are you
[251:48] okay yes you're not happy with it
[251:55] read only maybe

[252:07] owner
[252:19] and this is going to change
[252:27] it is early
[252:39] I don't know if we should and call the
[252:42] price maybe not
[252:45] we're just gonna remove it for now
[253:13] okay maybe that will be cool to have a
[253:16] little
[253:17] friendly like oh save 99 percent

[253:42] just gonna say if he's early
[253:47] this is going to be
[253:51] it's not the price and core it's going
[253:53] to be the pro the lens
[254:02] okay now we're gonna do the price in
[254:03] court but just I'm not gonna do it
[254:05] manually it's gonna be
[254:09] instead of six I think you earn 50 bucks
[254:12] is that correct yeah
[254:14] instead of 5.99
[254:18] okay
[254:20] it's still a big price tag
[254:23] there's to see how that works for her
[254:28] okay we have the pricing
[254:31] and we can probably finish with
[254:35] okay we need to add some stuff in here
[254:38] over

[254:42] need to

[256:33] I'm gonna use the testimonials we got
[256:35] from her customers the less ones
[256:39] import we have Petty
[256:44] import Pattaya
[256:47] it's a phone from Google

[258:33] and maybe your business I get more also
[258:35] having the feedback every day
[258:38] we're just gonna pick it is our smaller
[258:40] testimonials so I'm gonna take it easy
[258:55] I'm Gonna Leave This blank because we
[258:59] need another testimonial
[259:01] um this is from
[259:06] otherwise we just import Andrew one more
[259:08] time and we stick with Andrew for a
[259:10] little while
[259:13] so Andrew would be featured twice
[259:23] [Music]
[259:28] and sports would be uh finally GitHub
[259:34] come on you see it's you know it's Marta
[259:52] nope you're supposed to show me some
[259:54] pictures in here
[259:57] or to enter what the
[260:00] um
[260:04] Marta Andrew
[260:07] but he's fine but the others are not the
[260:09] point
[260:22] oh okay
[260:33] uh
[260:41] say whatever 24 students
[261:23] that's it that works yeah
[261:26] we got yep we get the yearly plan and
[261:30] normally we get the monthly plan
[261:34] okay sweet sweet actually
[261:40] yeah that was not the smartest move
[261:42] because
[261:43] I'll need two Luger users to sign up
[261:46] before
[261:48] it's okay
[261:51] um
[261:52] we're going to make the logo let's do
[261:54] some fun design stuff uh actually it's
[261:57] not it's going to be very simple it's
[261:58] just gonna be my wife's picture
[262:01] uh but we're gonna do that
[262:04] so we have something that looks a bit
[262:06] better
[262:07] so
[262:09] I call this logo
[262:12] and we need another one with a name
[262:18] picture should be around here
[262:24] There She Goes

[262:29] I'm gonna throw the white in there
[262:32] we go
[262:38] okay
[262:44] all right it's a bit easier to do logos
[262:46] this way uh
[262:50] 30 will probably will crop it like
[262:52] rounded or something
[262:55] and Export it and I'm gonna make it
[262:57] available in the app easy Korean public
[263:00] replace
[263:06] means yeah she's at the bottom she's not
[263:08] chick fest
[263:11] but
[263:12] but but
[263:15] I'm gonna maybe run
[263:18] around a little bit
[263:23] is that the one no is it yeah
[263:31] where are we
[263:41] could be
[263:47] maybe just a little bit okay just a
[263:49] little bit

[264:41] personal email we don't need to do that
[264:45] up Port legal in terms of services we
[264:49] don't really care for now
[264:54] and one last thing we're gonna throw is
[265:00] okay
[265:02] I think we have a website now we're just
[265:04] gonna find a way to make it
[265:06] just a little bit better
[265:13] would you give are people still awake
[265:17] in a bad spot
[265:20] hey tiguin yes this is using the ship
[265:22] has boilerplate I'm building on top of
[265:24] it
[265:26] what language it's the code it's the
[265:28] code is in JavaScript
[265:31] thanks for joining
[265:33] of the builds yep
[265:37] oh
[265:43] so a quick recap if you're joining what
[265:45] we have
[265:46] um this is not perfect but we have a
[265:49] website
[265:50] here that shows what you uh get so you
[265:55] get PDF current PDFs to practice your
[265:58] language you can sign up here
[266:02] you have testimonials from students some
[266:07] features here are displayed like what
[266:09] you can expect
[266:11] by signing up
[266:13] I need to make this bigger I think
[266:16] more testimonials some features here
[266:18] where you can join challenges
[266:21] and a pricing page it opens the stripe
[266:24] checkout thing
[266:26] I'm gonna have to remove that and make
[266:28] people sign up first as that makes more
[266:31] sense
[266:32] and and it's pretty much it uh
[266:35] great let me just fix this one the
[266:37] features
[266:40] here
[266:42] at
[266:44] your PDF
[266:46] this should be five
[266:51] typically we're boosting program while
[266:53] having fun okay
[266:55] better we are going to remove uh some of
[267:00] the old logos
[267:02] or is it I think it's here it tells me
[267:04] exactly what to do so
[267:07] yeah we need to have a logo with her
[267:09] name
[267:10] for the practice for the the page
[267:14] um
[267:15] I'm gonna create logo and
[267:19] name
[267:22] we're going to put our picture
[267:25] you're gonna say easy Korean
[267:30] using uh we said we use the Poppin pop
[267:33] instruments
[267:35] that's tricky
[267:38] or pins and we're gonna make it black
[267:42] so
[267:43] gold extra bold
[267:48] all right
[267:49] 80.
[267:52] 120.
[267:59] oh yeah are we okay we're gonna do that
[268:01] we're gonna use the colors
[268:05] the same colors of the side so that
[268:07] would look good
[268:09] uh so this would be
[268:13] the text color
[268:16] and the background should be the pinky
[268:18] color
[268:23] okay
[268:28] okay
[268:31] right so we're gonna export that put it
[268:32] in the in the boilerplate as well on my
[268:35] at the right place I think it yep I am
[268:37] at the right place I'm gonna replace it
[268:40] um we are going to use uh what is this
[268:44] yeah 5V cone generator
[268:47] Johannesburg
[268:49] that's that's that's
[268:51] yeah okay we're gonna use that little
[268:54] website here to make a favicon
[268:57] that's mandatory but
[268:59] this is easy to do next two minutes
[269:04] you see Korean public logo
[269:14] there we go
[269:16] download that thing
[269:37] I find it's a bit slow
[269:41] okay
[269:44] we got it
[269:45] we're gonna just copy and paste all
[269:47] those things
[269:50] inside our folder
[269:56] replace
[269:59] [Music]
[270:01] and boom we should have
[270:05] everything we need here
[270:09] yeah all right click on this displayed
[270:11] here
[270:12] let's review the site one last time
[270:19] um pressing review join easy Korean
[270:23] oh maybe we can add buttons oh yeah we
[270:26] can adjust we can add those buttons
[270:28] everywhere
[270:30] so I'm going to create a button a a sign
[270:35] but then sign in whatever
[270:44] this
[270:47] I'm gonna import
[270:56] is up
[271:00] I can remove it
[271:03] we're gonna put the button in here and
[271:06] this is going to be basically a sign up
[271:07] button that you can show
[271:09] pretty much everywhere in the app
[271:11] so import
[271:16] I think what do we have to do in here
[271:20] provider we don't care so we didn't say
[271:22] nothing fine
[271:24] and then I think we want a like here
[271:27] yeah that's it I'm gonna say users we're
[271:30] going to be building a private routes
[271:32] for users accounts and we're gonna put
[271:34] this on the dashboard thing
[271:37] but here I'm going to import the button
[271:40] sign in oops
[271:44] and a bridge in here
[271:50] and also
[271:52] on the features
[271:54] let's check it's working yeah that's the
[271:55] button we just created
[271:57] what we can do now is
[271:59] um we can add this button everywhere in
[272:01] the app and we're going to push users to
[272:03] a signing page and come back to the
[272:05] dashboard
[272:07] um
[272:08] whatever commit doesn't matter
[272:12] chats
[272:20] import button
[272:23] and then
[272:26] up we have the button
[272:33] uh we're going to do something like this
[272:36] first time
[272:37] situations like this we will need extra
[272:51] Style
[272:53] is here we will need to put limit button
[272:55] outline
[272:57] button
[272:59] neutral
[273:02] nope written accent
[273:06] yeah why not secondary
[273:11] okay I think the accent one is better
[273:26] okay
[273:27] and finally on the feature
[273:30] PDF we're also going to import it
[273:41] I think we're gonna show it here
[273:47] hmm
[273:52] or maybe we show it
[273:54] [Music]
[274:17] we edit somewhere
[274:22] foreign
[274:55] we can do something like this
[275:11] okay
[275:12] oh and I know we're gonna steal the
[275:14] thing
[275:14] this little thing here where is it uh
[275:17] SVG
[275:22] yeah we're gonna steal that
[275:28] oh
[275:33] button button button button sign in
[275:37] Master Korean join easy Korean
[275:40] um we're gonna call it the group
[275:43] what's this
[275:44] yeah okay we're gonna have this little
[275:46] cutie pie here
[275:49] looks more real
[275:51] um and also on the feature chats I think
[275:54] the feature PDF the button this should
[275:57] be Max should be hidden
[276:04] we shouldn't see it we should instead we
[276:07] should hear
[276:11] instead the front empty
[276:14] we'll show it here
[276:16] and mix
[276:22] yep that's a bit better
[276:28] all right that's a bit better
[276:30] but normally
[276:32] um
[276:35] we have the buttons here
[276:42] oh [ __ ] the button [ __ ] up my head my
[276:44] uh poor
[276:47] chat stuff
[276:48] [Music]
[276:48] um
[276:50] oh yeah he needs less bedding okay
[277:02] okay we're back
[277:12] you don't have to touch this
[277:27] um
[277:38] okay
[277:44] maybe a little bit more space
[277:50] all right okay that's good easy Korean
[277:54] the pricing yeah we need to fix the
[277:56] pricing one last time
[277:58] because
[277:59] it's not supposed to open a checkout
[278:02] right now
[278:04] so we are going to remove that
[278:08] we know actually we just need to remove
[278:10] that button and we just need to say
[278:14] um import button
[278:17] sign in and log users in
[278:27] okay
[278:29] and probably here
[278:32] and make extra style button
[278:35] lock
[278:37] any time okay
[278:39] and
[278:44] all right I think this is pretty cool
[278:47] okay I think yeah this is pretty cool
[278:50] it needs some rewrite or rewriting for
[278:53] the copy but this is pretty much the end
[278:54] of it now I
[278:56] um
[278:57] okay what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
[278:59] make it a bit more Korean in some way
[279:02] like I'm probably going to add some
[279:04] Korean sentences here and there
[279:06] like this one
[279:08] so it looks like you know like it's a
[279:10] Korean language like some cutie stuff
[279:11] like Korean flag
[279:13] Korean language or any any of those
[279:20] I pushed the um you're the owner of a we
[279:25] are the owners of easy korean.com
[279:31] and find your website
[279:44] oh hinder
[279:47] wow that's not
[279:51] oh wow you have lots of squeezing
[279:56] so cute you're almost done
[280:00] yeah for the landing page so I'm going
[280:03] to add some Korean whatever flag Korean
[280:07] characters or something on the page like
[280:09] cutie stuff
[280:12] um you can go to easy korean.com and you
[280:14] can check the pictures I think
[280:18] the copy needs to be Rewritten a little
[280:20] bit like
[280:21] I think you can go over the page read
[280:23] all the copy and see what makes sense
[280:25] and what doesn't
[280:28] um
[280:28] in the pictures
[280:30] now that the layout is made it would be
[280:32] nice to come up with different pictures
[280:34] so I think this one is good because
[280:36] there's a lot of things going on but
[280:38] it's okay but I think in this part where
[280:41] you highlight all the features of your
[280:43] PDF like all the things you can do with
[280:45] it
[280:46] I think this is hard to read
[280:49] like this one too I think that's the
[280:52] same yeah this one too like I have I
[280:54] literally have to zoom with my mouse to
[280:56] see it so you might want to give me
[280:58] something similar but like more zoomed
[281:01] or something that really represent each
[281:03] feature because I yeah
[281:05] no it doesn't have to be no yeah right
[281:07] you can do anytime no I mean at least
[281:10] the site is ready but now you know you
[281:11] know what to do it yeah you can just go
[281:13] on the side step by step and just see
[281:15] what you want to improve what you want
[281:16] to change it's not I just put random
[281:19] pictures on this display it's totally
[281:21] fine because I'm not I don't need it
[281:23] right now

[287:49] maybe bigger no yeah
[287:52] and they're smaller probably
[288:05] again bigger

[288:11] top Corner yeah just put Korean Emoji in
[288:15] there
[288:17] next to which letter okay the fur at the
[288:20] top
[288:23] okay
[288:24] uh I'm just gonna need some space

[288:41] oh okay yes I get it
[288:44] made it easy
[289:09] oops
[289:10] getting a bit too far here

[289:21] risk it resize the frame
[289:24] oh [ __ ] sorry I missed that
[289:27] thanks for the tip
[289:29] okay to reset the frame
[289:42] I mean maybe I need to move that around
[289:46] that's kind of weird if I do that
[289:51] or
[290:01] I don't know what you guys think
[290:05] let me know I get two versions this one
[290:08] or
[290:10] this one
[290:16] with this somewhere else
[290:22] I think
[290:25] I think this bottom one makes more sense
[290:27] in terms of uh
[290:31] layout
[291:05] on the first line second one for me and
[291:09] current in the first light
[291:11] oops
[291:28] oh maybe I have okay let me try this
[291:37] foreign
[292:14] if we do something like this
[292:36] like Korean be here oh yep yep yep
[292:39] risk okay that's okay
[292:42] okay let me try
[292:46] on it
[292:48] okay okay
[292:54] I am actually pressing K but it looks
[292:56] like
[292:58] it's stuck at 1.1
[293:01] what is going on
[293:05] oh
[293:07] dude thank you so much I've I've
[293:10] struggled
[293:11] sort of a so long time on figma with
[293:14] this
[293:15] ah
[293:16] I really appreciate it
[293:27] it's like a life-changing thing here
[293:31] wait I don't even know how I was doing
[293:33] before because now it seems like it's I
[293:35] didn't even press K and it's working
[293:42] and whatever I mean if wow that's so
[293:44] cool thank you
[294:09] daddy We're Not Gonna overthink it we're
[294:10] gonna go for the first one
[294:13] here we go
[294:15] so this uh this is going to sit on the
[294:20] main folder in the public folder and
[294:22] whenever someone shares this on social
[294:24] media it's gonna hit these routes
[294:29] and it's gonna show a this image
[294:32] I'm gonna commit that uh social
[294:37] that should be working
[294:43] okay okay it's time to add a little
[294:45] cutie stuff in here
[294:48] uh
[294:49] which phone could we use for Korean
[294:56] Google phones
[295:05] there's some specific Korean phone if I
[295:07] type Korean no two sense
[295:10] or maybe there's something oh not the
[295:12] same sir oh but perfect
[295:15] let's hope it's available in the next
[295:18] thing
[295:26] how would I use
[295:36] oh maybe I'm going to create a
[295:37] competence because I might add a couple
[295:40] Korean Js
[295:44] uh how do we do that
[295:50] and we do this
[295:54] instead that is going to be no tool
[295:57] sense
[296:00] Korean
[296:01] there are a bunch of them wow
[296:05] they are maybe variant
[296:16] which is gonna make it to the wrapper
[296:18] and we're gonna say children
[296:34] last name
[296:38] um I think it's font
[296:43] last name
[296:45] thing that that's what it is I'm not
[296:48] sure
[296:52] that's right
[296:53] go to the euro section and import that
[296:56] thing
[297:02] uh where can we put that
[297:09] okay underneath
[297:26] no 400.
[297:27] oh yeah no there is five six doesn't
[297:30] exist it's a 700
[297:33] I think that should be enough
[297:36] and let's say
[297:51] this is not the right phones
[297:54] uh what do they do here
[298:03] foreign
[298:28] or something
[298:40] I need opacity
[298:44] maybe you could add Korean words in the
[298:46] background yes exactly yeah
[298:48] exactly what I'm trying to do to make it
[298:50] more like cute and stuff but I
[298:53] isn't this one Noto sense Korean
[299:01] it's serious oh no serif
[299:04] what did I do here
[299:08] is saver thank you
[299:13] oh perfect
[299:21] ah perfect and that is Korean
[299:25] okay that's cute
[299:27] um is there
[299:33] wait actually I can try to search by
[299:36] Korean
[299:40] okay
[299:45] let's see which one looks oh maybe these
[299:47] oh yeah like a pencil
[299:49] pencil thing
[299:52] oh
[299:55] there's so many
[299:58] maybe we're gonna filter by I have a six
[300:09] thank you
[300:14] because it would be nice actually if we
[300:16] didn't have like one that is handwritten
[300:18] like this one is not very pretty oh like
[300:21] this one gig
[300:27] miracle
[300:29] three four seven
[300:34] one
[300:36] all right that's cute if I make this
[300:37] bigger
[300:40] it looks quite small though but
[300:48] maybe they changes
[301:11] it's a tricky font here
[301:14] because it's very very small
[301:17] what is going on
[301:20] he sees 3XL
[301:23] okay maybe I'll take another one out
[301:25] okay he looks much smaller than the
[301:26] others okay I get it
[301:32] ah too bad
[301:36] Oh Henry Danger
[301:40] single day maybe oh that's very cute my
[301:43] wife will absolutely love it
[301:47] single day
[301:53] 300
[301:55] okay 400 perfect
[302:03] it's 2 p.m already
[302:08] it's
[302:15] also pretty small phone but it's okay
[302:20] that should be all right
[302:35] how does it look now
[302:39] okay what if you create assets female
[302:42] and it's vision
[302:50] uh hosting stack is
[302:53] uh it's versal
[302:57] um so it's it's all in there and I'm
[302:59] using next oath or user certification
[303:05] yeah I could use text 50 pixel here
[303:08] you can scale bigger in figma
[303:11] yeah I think
[303:13] I think I can stick with it
[303:16] I think that should this should be fine
[303:19] I'm probably gonna put it through later
[303:21] and do this
[303:23] absolute top
[303:26] maybe button
[303:44] four
[303:48] or or I just add them randomly
[304:00] okay I think yeah I'm gonna take it very
[304:02] easy I'm gonna do this
[304:07] and back to the index page
[304:11] import that and do
[304:14] it here nope
[304:17] it's going on import current from Korean
[304:20] oh yeah okay
[304:24] yeah
[304:25] I'm gonna do that click Center
[304:37] oh yeah I need to make it uh
[304:40] I think I need to make it a h
[304:43] or even a div
[304:46] you might have we might have some
[304:51] some other things like
[304:54] svgs in there
[304:57] I think I'm gonna do that
[305:00] I'd say
[305:03] I'm gonna make it super cute
[305:06] uh
[305:09] and gesture there's nothing that says
[305:11] hello
[305:18] something that would represent Korea SVG
[305:22] Curry
[305:23] Maybe
[305:25] Korean
[305:29] SVG doodles
[305:42] hey I would need those kind of stuff
[305:49] I think
[305:55] I like it
[306:02] see what we got here
[306:05] okay
[306:07] maybe I shouldn't bother too much and
[306:09] just add some of those
[306:13] yeah I think I'm gonna do it I'm gonna
[306:15] copy that thing here
[306:21] pretty cute uh copy element
[306:25] all right so maybe I'll put some
[306:27] animosity over here
[306:29] and maybe in between those things I will
[306:32] just add wow oh wait this is gonna be a
[306:36] total mess keep up
[306:39] keep up the juice if I knew one day I
[306:42] would write something like kpop.js

[321:50] program after is
[321:52] um user dashboard private trials showing
[321:56] the PDF and be able to download them in
[321:58] a special platform for my wife to be
[322:00] able to upload them and it's going to
[322:01] broadcast a message to her students so
[322:03] it's going to be less Visual and more
[322:05] but I can take you stuff
[322:08] right uh yeah stream is here I'll be
[322:11] back in 30 minutes
[322:18] we're just gonna write this down here
[322:21] that's in description
[322:53] cheers
[323:35] foreign
[372:15] it's welcome back
[372:19] um you guys hear me well
[372:31] yo hey what up
[372:33] boom
[372:35] we're still back
[372:37] okay had a little lunch coffee
[372:41] got the juice ready to rock and roll
[372:44] as a lunch man it was good some
[372:46] healthier much healthier some vegetables
[372:50] mistake and a coffee
[372:55] all right so if you're tuning into the
[372:57] stream right now we are building an
[372:59] e-learning platform uh for my wife who's
[373:02] a current teacher and she needs to have
[373:03] a platform and she can upload working
[373:05] materials like pdas for her students
[373:08] and they will get a notification by
[373:10] email and they can log into the site
[373:12] download the PDF and then have all the
[373:15] subscription things going on with stripe
[373:17] so they can upgrade downgraded
[373:19] subscriptions
[373:21] um cancel their their payments and all
[373:23] that
[373:25] um that's pretty much it so we have a
[373:27] learning page that's
[373:30] up and running
[373:32] this is the landing page
[373:35] we have a few errors here but it doesn't
[373:38] matter
[373:39] up so copy will be improved
[373:42] um also she my wife will have to give me
[373:45] more pictures so it looks better but
[373:46] that's pretty much it now we're
[373:48] currently able to log in users
[373:51] um only with emails for now we're gonna
[373:54] stick with that I think actually for
[373:55] these demo we're gonna probably gonna
[373:57] remove the Google provider
[373:59] so the Simplicity of it
[374:03] yeah that's it sign in with email
[374:06] um and then we're gonna rock and roll so
[374:08] we're going to build now we're going to
[374:09] build the dashboard
[374:11] uh which means uh we're gonna show two
[374:13] different things whether you are a
[374:16] student or you are a teacher
[374:18] um there will be only one teacher on
[374:20] this platform it's gonna be my wife but
[374:22] if you're building some similar app you
[374:24] could imagine having multiple teachers
[374:25] and then people uh users would get roles
[374:28] assigned when they sign up so you would
[374:30] either be a student or a teacher
[374:33] um
[374:34] yeah and and then when you are on the
[374:36] dashboard uh as a student you will see
[374:39] the PDFs listed if you have an active
[374:41] subscription so you're able to download
[374:43] them if you don't have an active
[374:45] subscription it will be disabled then
[374:46] you will have a button that lets you
[374:48] subscribe again and as a teacher you
[374:50] would see the same thing but you don't
[374:51] have the subscription thing and instead
[374:53] you would have a way to upload a PDF for
[374:56] that we're going to use
[374:58] um I think Amazon S3 buckets big bucket
[375:03] and we're going to upload that we're
[375:06] going to save the URL in the database
[375:08] and then when user logs in they're just
[375:10] going to list all the PDF that have been
[375:12] uploaded
[375:14] that's pretty much it
[375:16] using the magic link message
[375:20] I think the magic link thing is safe
[375:23] here in terms of you don't have any
[375:25] passwords so you cannot get hacked
[375:28] um so that's safer and also it's simpler
[375:32] depending on you know what you use but
[375:34] some we probably all that we all use
[375:37] some like password saving stuff so you
[375:40] don't you don't remember your passwords
[375:42] but uh maybe like normal people don't
[375:45] have those or don't use them a lot and
[375:47] they don't remember the passwords like
[375:48] my parents are actually uh they always
[375:51] forget the passwords so
[375:53] um so magic links help with that because
[375:55] you just put in your email and boom you
[375:58] have a link
[375:59] right so what we're going to do um
[376:02] I think we're just going to build a
[376:04] quick UI to get on the platform so
[376:07] here maybe in the header we're gonna say
[376:10] something that's
[376:12] uh um
[376:20] um should it be the header I don't know
[376:22] maybe I'm gonna build something very
[376:24] basic okay but I want to show people who
[376:27] are logged in and on the home page that
[376:29] there's a link
[376:30] for the dashboard
[376:32] for that I need the
[376:35] I think use session is called
[376:39] and we're gonna get
[376:42] I don't think this data I think it's
[376:45] status I believe
[376:50] and we're going to add something like
[376:53] that says
[376:55] status
[376:57] authenticated
[377:00] and add a button
[377:06] actually it's not even a button it's
[377:07] more like a link right there
[377:10] I'm just going to add a link to the to
[377:12] the dashboard
[377:17] dashboard is going to be that private
[377:20] route where things happen for the
[377:21] students
[377:23] you can see it's a button button
[377:25] primary I think
[377:29] um and we're going to position perhaps
[377:31] we're going to position it like this top
[377:35] maybe even better
[377:37] four
[377:39] right or shadow
[377:45] really that simple I did the room here
[377:49] oh yeah
[377:54] uh it's fixed I think it goes under so
[377:57] we're gonna put it relative
[378:00] even we can make it big massive
[378:05] okay we have that login button here
[378:09] is going to send the user to the
[378:10] dashboard we haven't built that route
[378:12] yet so we're gonna build it
[378:15] um
[378:19] thank you buddy luckily you say that so
[378:24] I just added this button the login
[378:25] button that's going to send the logged
[378:27] in user only the logged in user as you
[378:30] can see here
[378:31] to the dashboard
[378:36] Arrow
[378:41] hero icons for the wins bingo
[378:44] okay
[378:46] okay
[378:49] um so we will have a dashboard routes
[378:53] let's just dashboard
[378:58] here
[379:00] um so I'm using the sheet pass
[379:02] boilerplate it's a next year
[379:04] spoilerplate I built recently
[379:06] um that covers a bunch of uh things that
[379:09] you do when you set up an ad so there is
[379:11] a place where you go here you have the
[379:13] static page
[379:14] which could be that thing here and you
[379:16] put it in there
[379:17] and we don't need the phones though so
[379:20] I'm gonna remove that
[379:22] also we're going to remove that
[379:25] I think I will also remove that
[379:27] uh is that actually no I'm the wrong hey
[379:30] that's the wrong page yeah I need a
[379:33] private page here we go
[379:38] I'm gonna pass it in here remove the
[379:40] fonts we don't need
[379:42] uh
[379:47] I think I'm gonna go
[379:49] um there's board
[379:51] yeah okay good
[379:55] that's a tag that comes with the baller
[379:57] plate that set up all the SEO tags for
[380:00] Google
[380:02] um I think we can remove that here
[380:06] because we're not gonna need it
[380:09] um what else yeah also the boilerplate
[380:11] come with the use private hook a simple
[380:15] hook that will just log out users if if
[380:19] uh well if they're not authenticated
[380:24] um
[380:24] and gonna redirects them as you can see
[380:27] here it really breaks them to the
[380:28] dashboard thing and I think I believe in
[380:31] the config file we can just use the
[380:33] Callback here RL here
[380:36] port
[380:40] the config file is important
[380:47] yeah that's simpler so when you have
[380:49] this in the config file it's make things
[380:52] a bit easier
[380:53] then if tomorrow I change the url of the
[380:57] place where uh the dashboard URL for
[381:00] instance
[381:01] I'm sure that all buttons and things
[381:03] where you can log in logouts users will
[381:05] always come back at the right place
[381:06] think to this little thing here
[381:09] um so this is here oh yeah by Anyway by
[381:12] default that's exactly what happened
[381:14] that's pretty cool I'm proud of me I've
[381:16] held something smart uh users will come
[381:19] back on this thing
[381:20] uh so actually I don't even have to put
[381:22] it
[381:25] um
[381:25] maybe on the button sign in I need to
[381:28] import the URL import config
[381:32] and then here we're going to
[381:34] configure.callback
[381:39] call that qrf okay
[381:43] uh on the dashboard we don't need this
[381:46] yet
[381:48] all right let's see how that routes
[381:49] works okay
[381:52] should be should everything should be
[381:53] ready
[381:55] are we going to go on the login page
[381:58] and we need
[382:00] um
[382:01] [Music]
[382:04] use privates
[382:10] what do they do
[382:15] hey
[382:26] bingo
[382:33] oh yeah I think I need to pass this
[382:37] yeah okay yeah I need to prep that okay
[382:40] uh obviously this is not a food recipe
[382:42] your food recipe we're gonna remove that
[382:46] students
[382:48] uh dashboard
[382:53] welcome undefined yeah of course I don't
[382:55] have a name
[382:59] um
[383:02] remove that your email please we're
[383:05] gonna remove that later
[383:09] um
[383:11] we can use something like this like
[383:13] upload PDF
[383:16] and we can have a log out button
[383:20] okay that's the student dashboard
[383:24] um we need to play around with the
[383:27] schemas the mongod the mongodb mongoose
[383:35] yeah
[383:38] or using page over here so page
[383:41] directories I'm using it uh well because
[383:44] I've been playing around with it a lot
[383:46] so I'm kind of used to it and I haven't
[383:48] well I I think I'm confused was it a app
[383:52] that and then page and then router or is
[383:55] the because now I think there is a new
[383:57] version like where you have layouts and
[384:00] stuff
[384:00] I haven't played with that a lot I think
[384:03] I've heard some people saying it's not
[384:04] very stable in production so I kind of
[384:06] you know put it on the on the side for
[384:08] now
[384:09] with that story is something that I
[384:12] might uh update in the future
[384:17] so uh users users what we do we have
[384:23] um so these also come with a bottle
[384:25] plate as well uh there's a shimmer is
[384:27] ready so it's it's ready to you know
[384:29] save information that we need about
[384:32] users the most common ones usually those
[384:34] ones you get it from Google old or
[384:35] something and these are the ones we use
[384:37] in stripe
[384:39] um
[384:41] we will have a role a role which is a
[384:45] type screen and art whether you're a
[384:49] user or you are a student or you are a
[384:52] digital
[384:54] and default students in required
[384:57] true
[384:59] okay
[385:00] uh
[385:04] then we will have to save subscription
[385:06] so users will subscribe through stripe
[385:09] and if they are not active
[385:13] we're gonna have to turn on a Boolean
[385:15] somewhere I can okay we can do that
[385:18] later
[385:19] um we're gonna create another model
[385:21] called
[385:22] uh pdf.js
[385:26] it's basically going to be
[385:29] just a record to know that there is a
[385:32] PDF in the database somewhere so
[385:35] whenever the students upload the
[385:37] something we'll need the URL so type
[385:40] screen trim true required true
[385:45] what else do we need
[385:47] I think we don't need any much anything
[385:49] here
[385:50] for now yeah
[385:52] you can remove all that
[385:55] screen just have to update user schema
[385:57] would be PDF schema
[386:00] and
[386:02] user will actually be
[386:06] PDF
[386:08] when you do that you want to refresh the
[386:10] server because it caches the this thing
[386:13] here it cached the models
[386:15] so to let your code knows that the model
[386:18] has been updated you have to kill and
[386:20] restart the server
[386:23] um
[386:25] all right maybe now we can go
[386:27] with something simple we can do we can
[386:30] say
[386:31] go back on the dashboard
[386:37] I think we don't need the logout button
[386:39] for now
[386:41] and we're going to
[386:47] yeah we're gonna have to create a routes
[386:48] that fetch the user data so
[386:51] API
[386:53] user
[386:56] I think I'm just going to call it
[386:57] index.js
[386:59] and same in the ship as well I played
[387:01] there is a template but that's where you
[387:03] pick it up here
[387:06] API routes
[387:08] that's the classic stuff we do all the
[387:10] time just copy pasting there and we have
[387:13] a function with a this one has a patch
[387:15] method I think I'm just for now I'm just
[387:16] going to use the GIF method
[387:17] we don't need that
[387:19] uh
[387:22] yeah I just want so basically here I get
[387:24] the session from the user
[387:26] um if the user is not authenticated we
[387:28] just move on and return if 401 it's
[387:30] going to log out the students
[387:34] um we don't have any in here
[387:37] yeah and we're just gonna find the user
[387:39] by ID and if there is no user we send an
[387:42] error
[387:43] and we just remove that and return the
[387:46] user
[387:50] and then the what happens also this is
[387:52] pretty cool uh what's his name the user
[387:54] model on Mongoose has a where is it
[387:59] private
[388:00] key here
[388:02] so these use the plugin to Json
[388:06] which when the data is transforming to a
[388:09] Json file so when it's sent back to the
[388:10] front end it's going to delete useless
[388:13] stuff like the dot V and the dot ID I
[388:16] replace the slash ID by just ID it's
[388:18] simpler and also the private things will
[388:22] be deleted
[388:23] so
[388:24] with this here you're never going to
[388:26] send
[388:27] your email back to the user so if you're
[388:31] logged in user in that case it is okay
[388:33] to send the email back but you could
[388:35] even imagine having a route that shows
[388:37] your user profiles registering to the
[388:39] platform you don't want to send the
[388:40] email
[388:41] back to the front end so this plugin
[388:44] will make sure that you don't send it
[388:46] that's pretty cool that avoid leaking
[388:50] API keys and stuff like that for
[388:51] instance
[388:53] um
[388:55] where where we dashboard yeah
[388:58] uh where is the right oh okay that's
[389:00] right so we have the user we send it
[389:02] back so
[389:03] here in the dashboard
[389:05] uh do we have SWA
[389:13] uh
[389:16] Rusty
[389:18] um
[389:21] a little mess in here
[389:26] I might be using make lending code a
[389:28] little bit later
[389:34] uh
[389:41] hid
[390:02] okay I'm just gonna I'm just copying the
[390:04] code that I use for
[390:09] for another app so we save some time
[390:14] um I'm gonna need npme SW air to fetch
[390:18] the data from the front end
[390:19] I'm going to sit as well
[390:52] why does she need a SAS uh well she
[390:56] needed because uh
[390:59] well not if it's not just a community
[391:01] the community is one feature of it
[391:04] people come from the material so they
[391:06] don't have to join the community if
[391:07] you're uh an introvert and you know
[391:10] you're not you don't want to talk to
[391:11] people you don't have to be in there
[391:13] and also because then people can just
[391:15] manage their subscription so you have
[391:17] you can have a dashboard and stripe
[391:19] where people can subscribe like it would
[391:22] it would be so such a mess to send
[391:23] direct links to to stripe payments and
[391:26] anything like that
[391:27] and yeah every time someone would have
[391:30] to cancel that they would have to
[391:31] message over whatever but it's just
[391:32] making things more complicated so and
[391:35] she's lucky she has a husband that can
[391:36] code some stuff so
[391:38] why not using the husband
[391:48] ah news okay
[391:51] uh very simply
[392:18] um okay so here we're going to use the
[392:20] API clients
[392:22] uh and it's gonna start it's gonna hit
[392:25] user
[392:26] the get method everybody doesn't Focus
[392:28] okay
[392:30] and just for the fun we're going to
[392:32] console look that
[392:36] all right so we get the data back here
[392:38] this is from the front end
[392:40] I am registered as a students this is my
[392:42] email verified IDs and stuff
[392:45] uh why was I even doing that yeah I'm
[392:48] doing that because uh because because
[392:51] because because
[392:55] fried
[393:00] why was I even doing that oh my God
[393:07] this is
[393:09] someone turning to Insanity right here
[393:15] okay yeah I remember now tip of water in
[393:18] we feel better
[393:20] um
[393:25] we're going to go to the database and
[393:28] well give me a second I just make sure
[393:30] I'm not leaking some API keys in here
[393:42] okay all good
[393:46] so
[393:47] this is the local database uh this is
[393:50] all local I'm running on my machine
[393:54] how did I call that thing
[393:56] um
[393:57] is it even somewhere in there
[394:00] your database Maybe
[394:02] is that it user
[394:05] nope I don't think that's me
[394:08] easy Korean oh there we go
[394:11] so yeah here oh yeah when
[394:14] yeah back then there was no role
[394:18] when I when I sign up so he wasn't
[394:20] created without it but I'm gonna see
[394:21] that manually so I am a teacher
[394:24] normally here in my fronts I get yeah
[394:28] I'm a teacher
[394:29] because I'm a teacher then I will be
[394:31] able to upload a PDF so we're gonna do
[394:38] we're gonna say something like uh
[394:40] Fitness dashboard or maybe here I'm
[394:42] gonna say like
[394:44] data
[394:48] a user the role
[394:51] oh user data Maybe
[394:57] we'll equal teacher and uh teacher
[395:01] dashboard
[395:03] and user Network to make it cute and
[395:06] simple I'm going to add images
[395:10] students

[395:16] change a bit teacher
[395:19] and no not teach your students yeah
[395:21] David Mark what are you doing
[395:23] teacher
[395:28] okay we have a teacher in that board
[395:33] so she will be able to push on a PDF so
[395:37] if you do that we're going to upload
[395:40] uh well okay two there are three things
[395:43] we need to create a PDF in the database
[395:46] with a URL that we get from
[395:49] AWS we need to upload to AWS and we need
[395:54] to broadcast emails to the students
[395:57] so I'm gonna do this in three steps I
[396:00] guess
[396:01] uh
[396:03] first I have to create the UI let's get
[396:05] started
[396:08] PDF
[396:14] I think I also have a code from make
[396:16] lending where did I use that
[396:19] why do people use this on make living
[396:30] I go now I cannot upload anything here
[396:32] why do I remember I have these codes
[396:35] some oh no Indie page
[396:38] yeah because you can upload pictures of
[396:40] you actually here too
[396:43] yeah
[396:45] there you go all right that's the code
[396:46] we want okay we're gonna we're gonna
[396:49] cheat a bit I think it's called Moto
[396:51] image
[396:52] upload
[396:54] is loading uh where is the code yeah I
[396:57] think that's the code
[397:00] the picture upload
[397:04] all right we're gonna put that thing in
[397:06] here
[397:08] um
[397:09] your email we don't really care
[397:14] I'm gonna say
[397:18] why do I use that thing
[397:23] oh yeah okay we don't need that yeah
[397:26] file name uh-huh
[397:28] [Music]
[397:29] you're gonna call it PDF
[397:33] includes no
[397:35] visible
[397:38] a Target that fines
[397:45] oh
[397:49] Thank You guitar pilot
[397:51] we want to upload and push that file do
[397:54] we need to do any I don't do much file
[397:57] upload so I don't know if I'm missing
[397:59] anything
[398:00] I think
[398:01] upload
[398:05] peace
[398:17] I'm just going to copy that function we
[398:19] have the code here
[398:21] oh well hey that makes things a bit
[398:24] simpler
[398:27] all right I'm going to copy past this
[398:29] function
[398:56] we need to receive the file
[399:01] [Music]
[399:05] that's the file we're getting
[399:07] if there's no file or if it's loading we
[399:10] say no no
[399:13] I'm gonna create new loading for
[399:15] uploading stuff
[399:19] so if you're loading
[399:21] wait array and pick your size
[399:30] I think I'm gonna make it five megabytes
[399:35] the oh yeah the toast we have to import
[399:38] this
[399:40] board toast
[399:42] it's a simple library that is absolutely
[399:45] absolutely beautiful you can send error
[399:48] messages very simply
[399:49] it's an error
[399:52] come on GitHub save me
[399:56] yep
[399:57] uh okay but that's the right thing
[400:02] we're gonna say we're loading
[400:05] we will need oh yeah we need three
[400:07] things for Amazon we need to sign the
[400:09] URL
[400:11] and then we need to put on the file
[400:12] there
[400:14] wow
[400:17] image
[400:28] nope we don't need that I saved sent
[400:51] measuring those
[400:58] all right so that's our front end uh
[401:00] thing
[401:02] I need to import axios as well
[401:08] so we need to create
[401:10] oh I think I'm going to add those boring
[401:12] functions to the boilerplate as well
[401:14] like to get signed URL and to just
[401:16] upload something there
[401:17] I think that would be very useful
[401:21] actually this whole function can be
[401:23] added there
[401:24] right how do we get the sign URL here
[401:29] that's the beauty of multiple projects I
[401:32] just copy
[401:33] this one
[401:34] uh in the API I'm going to create a
[401:36] folder called AWS and I'm going to throw
[401:39] all
[401:40] functions there
[401:44] and you're uh that's the one yep
[401:48] uh so we don't need that
[401:51] it's uh oh I need to import the leave
[401:53] also from AWS and this should be good
[402:02] all right I'll need to get some API keys
[402:04] after
[402:09] that's
[402:12] that's gonna make things much simpler
[402:16] oh I think I need to download that thing
[402:20] I
[402:22] said yeah
[402:24] so we upload that image
[402:27] I think this is not good I think this is
[402:31] going to be a PDF so that might be
[402:34] wrong we're gonna give it a try but that
[402:36] may be wrong
[402:39] I might be wrong too okay yeah because
[402:41] this code was used for make lending it
[402:43] might be a bit different in here
[402:45] so when we get the sign URL first we uh
[402:50] we'll just need we don't need all that
[402:52] actually
[402:54] how do we want to store the PDF
[402:59] just a random ID it doesn't matter
[403:19] hey I think
[403:27] I think we're just gonna do some PDF ID
[403:37] I think that should be it we find a user
[403:40] by D
[403:40] [Music]
[403:41] um
[403:42] if user dots
[403:45] role is different
[403:49] a teacher
[403:54] you don't
[403:57] have access to this
[404:00] up
[404:01] get sign URL here we're just going to
[404:03] pass on the PDF ID
[404:07] and we're going to send back the URL so
[404:09] okay on AWS what which one do we use we
[404:13] use git sign URL
[404:15] but this one
[404:22] um
[404:23] what's going to happen if I do that
[404:26] the key uh
[404:29] PDF ID
[404:32] we don't need that
[404:40] maybe we just
[404:41] don't even need to do that
[404:52] yeah we don't even need to do that
[404:57] the PDF ID will be something that I'll
[404:59] store in mongodb like a object ID
[405:02] first content type what is content type
[405:05] okay
[405:07] GitHub Pilots one more time
[405:14] all right we might not use those ones so
[405:16] get the sign URL that's good I will need
[405:18] to set up my private and public keys for
[405:22] going to Amazon
[405:28] and I'm going to show you my stupid face
[405:29] just to make sure I don't leak my
[405:32] passwords and keys and stuff
[405:35] you don't take too long
[405:53] notification code
[406:08] oh
[406:09] well is that
[406:13] well maybe just I'm just using the same
[406:15] keys for Amazon
[406:17] maybe I don't even need
[406:19] to have different sets of keys wait let
[406:21] me check the Ws
[406:26] is that it I think it's the same
[406:38] oh yeah that's exactly the same I'm
[406:40] using for every project okay so I don't
[406:42] have to do that and we're gonna save
[406:43] some time
[406:45] that is good but if my keys are leaking
[406:47] I'm dead
[406:49] uh so
[406:53] okay
[406:54] give me one second I'm gonna set up the
[406:56] the keys in the project and we should be
[406:58] good to go
[407:02] okay
[407:03] all right
[407:04] enough of my stupid face
[407:19] somewhere organism
[407:26] we're going to pull it actually it's the
[407:30] same stripe example used for this and
[407:31] it'll just reuse and existing bucket and
[407:34] just call it a day
[407:36] or Transformer you can also do those uh
[407:39] heating period
[407:42] but I don't have to set up a public gift
[407:44] to stretch
[407:48] go on Minecraft we need to change that
[407:51] LG 2.8 here
[407:57] okay
[408:05] because
[408:06] it will be
[408:12] eliminated this way
[408:16] here what I'm gonna push this to Amazon
[408:19] I need the buckets I need the key okay
[408:23] that's the key that's where I mean okay
[408:25] so the key will be I guess lunch
[408:29] we just
[408:31] need three
[408:33] flesh to deal with the baby because I
[408:35] want to make sure he ends in the easy
[408:37] green wood
[408:41] yeah
[408:43] I'm gonna give it a try I don't know if
[408:45] that's gonna work with you I want to put
[408:47] DC here
[408:50] I put this in here
[408:56] um
[409:09] here
[409:15] but we're going to create a top of the
[409:17] whole thing is
[409:19] here
[409:27] there's an adventure video I'm going to
[409:29] use that to create PS I've been using
[409:31] the database so
[409:34] English
[409:40] it's nothing
[409:43] and so yeah
[409:47] the year can you help the zero role is
[409:53] different integer I'm gonna say you
[409:56] don't have access
[409:59] I know you're good
[410:03] um
[410:12] and then let's send back the video
[410:36] but here I will
[410:39] do this
[410:46] is very smart
[410:54] holder and delicious video
[411:04] no firms
[411:10] so we have the PDF ID that's going to be
[411:13] here so here I'm going to post
[411:17] to get the sign here up from AWS sending
[411:20] an opinion ID to be
[411:22] but by not doing some magic again
[411:25] the period ID back
[411:31] so I send it I have it there's it
[411:35] yeah here I created here I get the URL
[411:39] to upload
[411:43] here I um
[411:52] video
[411:56] with the PDF ID of course
[412:00] in the URL from AWS
[412:05] and so in this thing in here I'm going
[412:09] to create a network of patch that's
[412:10] going to be very similar
[412:15] foreign
[413:25] wait can you can you guys hear me now it
[413:28] looks like I see audio inputs being
[413:30] somewhere here
[413:36] that is absolutely Magic
[413:42] oh man thank you so much sibo
[413:46] that's my position for not checking the
[413:47] chat often enough thank you very much
[413:55] you also imported the wrong oh yeah the
[413:57] wrong PDF the PDF money wrong
[414:00] it's all ticket solved the PDF wrong um
[414:04] that is Magic as well ah [ __ ]
[414:08] we're gonna play around we're gonna I'm
[414:11] sending up like four API routes we're
[414:12] gonna make one call and see if
[414:15] we can do like an ace thing where no
[414:18] mistake no bugs this never happens but
[414:20] we're gonna give it a try
[414:22] uh
[414:23] so sorry what was I uh so we
[414:26] we we we create the PDF in the database
[414:29] we get
[414:30] we tell AWS to create a sun URL we
[414:33] upload the PDF
[414:36] and we change the url in the patch
[414:39] method so in the patch one we're gonna
[414:40] get the user
[414:42] verify it's a teacher and we're gonna do
[414:45] we're gonna oh yeah fine we're gonna
[414:47] find the PDF
[414:49] I'm gonna say PDF equal
[414:52] ID
[414:55] pdf.url equal URL
[414:58] to wait
[415:00] PDF let's save
[415:03] and we're gonna send back the PDF and
[415:06] here
[415:09] we don't necessarily need the URL so
[415:11] we're good right
[415:13] let's see how that goes there's no way
[415:16] this works
[415:19] because you guys seems to know what's
[415:22] going on
[415:22] let's see if anyone any of you so uh
[415:27] okay
[415:33] okay nobody saw another error so let's
[415:36] give it a try
[415:37] if this works normally we're going to
[415:40] have uh
[415:44] [ __ ] people I love you I had to say it
[415:47] if this works we're going to have a PDF
[415:49] uploaded
[415:50] on this page and we are going to have
[415:56] these guys being way over confident
[415:58] those routes will never it's not even
[416:01] gonna pass the first call uh so yeah we
[416:03] should have normally a PDF created here
[416:06] as well
[416:08] let's go uh actually I don't have PDFs
[416:15] okay that's my tax report
[416:21] I might not want to might not want to do
[416:24] that here
[416:25] Taiwanese workbook it's a big all right
[416:29] that's an invoice we can upload an
[416:30] invoice
[416:33] okay
[416:35] uh from origin as below course policies
[416:39] oh yeah
[416:42] we get so
[416:46] make sure we have the right URL yeah it
[416:48] seems like it's PDF uh
[416:54] how do I do this
[417:04] wait we I think
[417:06] we pass on the first thing we created a
[417:09] PDF somewhere
[417:12] I'm gonna refresh make sure we have it
[417:14] yeah okay we have the PDF we have an ID
[417:18] now we're struggling getting I guess the
[417:21] signed URL
[417:23] signature does not match
[417:29] workbook so is that the correct one
[417:33] so that's the PDF okay that's the
[417:34] correct thing
[417:36] workbook PDF easy Korean
[417:43] I'm just going to give a little try to
[417:45] something just make sure uh we are
[417:49] we're right here
[417:58] all right let's give it another try
[418:01] I think I'm just gonna I'm gonna do this
[418:03] multiple times so I'm going to rename
[418:05] the file so it appears
[418:07] somewhere
[418:09] uh what was the name invoice I think
[418:11] sheet Fest
[418:18] that's it
[418:22] all right anyway move on
[418:26] and find it this way
[418:34] okay we don't oh we get that you're oh
[418:36] we got the signed URL
[418:38] oh I know why I [ __ ] up
[418:42] I think I know
[418:44] so we get the URL back which is good
[418:48] it's when I upload here that's wrong
[418:56] you guys are much smarter than me I'm
[418:58] gonna rely on if anyone on the stream
[418:59] saw something
[419:04] okay no I think I went too deep in the
[419:06] rabbit hallway
[419:08] yeah
[419:09] yeah so this is a massive function that
[419:13] I called on the front hand first we
[419:15] create a PDF in the database that works
[419:17] secondly we get a signed URL from
[419:20] AWS so we have it here that's the that's
[419:25] the actually there the URL here
[419:28] and then I think that's the function
[419:29] that errors
[419:33] here
[419:34] I get a coarse error
[419:40] maybe you can
[419:42] add a little bit more space
[419:44] for that function right there
[419:47] easy Korean no no no
[419:51] I'm origin
[419:56] no access origin header is present on
[419:58] the resource control
[420:17] why would there be
[420:27] yeah yeah dude
[420:31] these and passwords
[420:33] yeah try to get rid of it the the weird
[420:35] part is that it actually works on my
[420:37] other app
[420:39] we have another I use this this is the
[420:42] exact same code I use
[420:44] and these worked
[420:51] and now I get the same error
[420:54] is that possible that's
[420:58] you could add course to A3
[421:00] okay
[421:02] all right so
[421:05] I think
[421:07] is that is that I think I set it up
[421:10] because so these workbook PDFs thing is
[421:12] something I use for
[421:16] oh wait
[421:18] oh you're right I think I didn't set it
[421:19] up because
[421:21] it's not facing users so the course is
[421:23] probably
[421:24] not authorized
[421:29] oh you're 100 right yeah okay
[421:33] oh wait maybe it's here
[421:35] what did I set up here
[421:40] follow headers hello Origins
[421:47] okay it's a bit confusing wait I'm gonna
[421:48] open if you guys want to check it out
[421:49] this is here
[421:51] uh
[421:53] we have
[421:55] I need to find another bucket of mine oh
[421:58] wait that was good
[422:01] I look at uh my calendar for instance
[422:06] permissions
[422:09] it had passed
[422:16] we're just gonna copy
[422:23] that might be that
[422:35] all right let's try it
[422:38] one more chance
[422:57] what's going on
[423:07] oh I feel I feel some tension here
[423:11] it looks like it's it might be working
[423:23] I know I think I just didn't oh wait no
[423:26] nothing nothing happened well try it
[423:28] again
[423:29] I think the button was broken
[423:37] I think it's working no still not
[423:40] forbidden
[423:41] is he Korean
[423:44] all right so we get a different error
[423:45] now
[423:48] why are we forbidden
[424:02] you just if you just give me the right
[424:04] URL to sign why wouldn't you allow me to
[424:08] do it
[424:11] okay
[424:22] oh you guys don't
[424:24] wait
[424:26] I move my screen a bit
[424:31] oh okay you don't see the whole screen
[424:33] wait I can move it
[424:36] this might be a bit easier
[424:43] I'd put to a loaded method
[424:46] um
[424:47] I stating I think I I did it here well
[424:50] maybe it's because it takes some time to
[424:52] propagate the changes or something
[424:55] I'm in the right
[424:56] that's the bucket here that I'm using
[425:06] because I I just added those
[425:08] so
[425:10] it should be there
[425:13] is
[425:19] or I don't know I'm maybe that's stupid
[425:22] but maybe it's different for sub
[425:24] subfolders because it's not in the root
[425:26] one
[425:37] I know I don't think that's that would
[425:38] make a difference
[425:46] the one
[425:48] um working with is the one on the left
[425:50] this one this one on the right is one I
[425:53] use for another project and that has no
[425:55] problem so far I'm trying to find out
[425:57] the reason
[426:16] right
[426:18] the permission seems to be set up pretty
[426:20] similar I'll give it another try I don't
[426:23] know
[426:36] the same error
[426:40] 403
[426:43] I agree
[426:47] okay it's just forbidden
[426:57] oh yeah so use the edible stream package
[427:04] make sure that the chance oh
[427:08] let me get filthy
[427:18] in the
[427:20] in the bucket policies
[427:26] are you are you referencing to oh yeah
[427:29] here
[427:39] is that a thing
[427:42] or maybe I'll just remove this one
[427:43] because anyway we're using this one
[427:46] um
[427:51] the reason
[427:54] so uh
[427:56] sure
[427:58] history put would be a thing
[428:02] oh in actions okay I'll give it a try
[428:08] okay
[428:13] great
[428:18] so I would copy that thing probably
[428:38] oh [ __ ] uh if you want to send a link
[428:40] you can send it to me on Twitter I'll
[428:42] check it out
[428:44] I'll open my Twitter here
[428:57] 's another try I think Dimitri dimitro
[429:00] if yeah that's you from Twitter and I
[429:02] think you're in the Stream
[429:13] all right the headers
[429:15] uh so we get the pre-flight request but
[429:19] that's not a course anymore that's good
[429:22] access
[429:27] wait is it a four or four it's a bad
[429:29] request
[429:39] here was a oh yeah here was forbidden
[429:41] 403. here it's a four oh
[429:45] so I think it's working we've we've made
[429:47] some progress here
[429:52] it's just a bad request maybe that's the
[429:53] file I don't know maybe I'm just not
[429:55] uploading
[429:56] the PDF as I should
[430:11] okay let me see if I can improve a
[430:14] little bit uh inputs
[430:19] can you guys hear me better because it's
[430:22] okay
[430:32] I don't care okay
[430:48] uh green
[430:56] foreign
[431:08] but we get a four or four
[431:12] lovely mint
[431:17] I think I think we fixed the course
[431:19] thing
[431:23] all right I'm gonna try it one more time
[431:25] yeah I'm gonna clear the console so we
[431:27] can see clearly what we have
[431:31] I think it's it's now it's maybe it's
[431:33] the file that's wrong or something
[431:38] um
[431:43] yeah that's the pre-flight request yeah
[431:46] we get a bad request
[431:50] um
[431:51] signature
[432:07] I actually don't know what what's what's
[432:10] a bad request uh
[432:12] could that be how I
[432:14] I put the file or something
[432:18] maybe I can
[432:20] maybe it's the type
[432:22] um
[432:37] I'm not a big uh anybody else user so I
[432:41] kind of uh I suck at this
[432:44] yeah I think yeah content ice might be a
[432:46] mismatch here
[432:59] is it a permission issue
[433:01] is what I see here
[433:04] it seems like a four oh oh it's just a
[433:06] bad request
[433:13] we so before we had the 403 it was a
[433:17] course issue and and we fixed it but now
[433:20] I think it's it's more like
[433:24] it's more of a
[433:27] content type match or something
[433:31] I think I might just be doing it wrong
[433:33] because I've never uploaded PDFs earlier
[433:35] and maybe you can just check it um
[433:41] we signed the URL and this is what we do
[433:44] here when we sign the URL I use this
[433:47] function
[433:48] here oh I think I know
[433:51] no I don't
[433:53] forget it
[433:57] it was a bit too enthusiasts uh
[434:03] so yeah that's the function I called
[434:05] from the API and I use content type that
[434:09] might be the wrong thing
[434:22] maybe I just check real quick what's the
[434:30] I think if I like there can be something
[434:33] actually simpler maybe that's the only
[434:34] issue here
[434:42] application.pdf no okay
[434:51] content application.pf
[434:54] kind of stuck here
[434:58] put object
[435:00] earns
[435:09] check your headers
[435:11] okay let's check the headers
[435:14] um
[435:18] response headers
[435:20] request header
[435:22] this is what we got
[435:29] application.pdf RPS Amazon okay
[435:39] content type
[435:43] I actually don't know what I'm doing
[435:45] wrong here
[435:54] person
[436:01] could that be no
[436:13] I think okay right
[436:17] let me try something else
[436:22] get signarium seems to refer to initial
[436:24] over publicly it's signed you around
[436:40] this so it seems to refer to an ACL of
[436:43] public read
[436:45] uh yep
[436:52] you think it should be something else
[437:02] should GPS and they're helping uh
[437:11] your contact
[437:16] we don't suck until the app is live
[437:21] I gotta hurry up though because it's
[437:22] getting late in my time zone
[437:28] how about we try with a picture see if
[437:30] that's a content type issue or something
[437:36] so maybe I do the file
[437:50] okay uh the sun URL we're gonna get
[437:54] where is that thing
[438:07] if I did content type and here
[438:40] simple
[438:51] let's try something like this maybe
[438:54] I have more luck
[438:56] um
[438:57] put back on the dashboard I'm gonna
[438:58] allow
[439:03] let's upload a picture
[439:05] or yeah we can upload that see what's
[439:09] going on
[439:14] yeah I got the same error
[439:18] uh
[439:29] I just check I have wait I get the sign
[439:31] URL that looks like this
[439:37] once
[439:38] is it Korean
[439:41] okay
[439:48] one time
[440:38] Euro looks good
[440:46] maybe skip S3 and try to remember
[441:03] hello let me try to see what you just
[441:05] sent
[441:08] it
[441:18] that's not the right link
[441:33] it's on URL
[441:39] so what do we have here so yeah if if
[441:41] you're tuning it right now
[441:43] um
[441:44] what I'm trying to do is to so I get a
[441:48] signed URL from AWS
[441:50] on the API on our API we call this
[441:54] function
[441:55] and this function is basically this
[441:59] uh we get a sign URL from AWS so we send
[442:03] uh
[442:04] we already have a bucket that's running
[442:07] um I've used it for other projects so I
[442:08] know the bucket somehow is okay
[442:11] we get the URL back here that's the sign
[442:14] URL here so this function here is
[442:17] running well
[442:18] and then the second part is we upload
[442:21] the file to AWS using the signed URL
[442:24] here so we put in the URL the file
[442:28] and that gets a 400 error that says bad
[442:32] requests I tried with PDFs svgs and
[442:35] images it doesn't work so that's
[442:36] something else I just don't know what it
[442:38] is and artificially said something about
[442:40] the region that I'm trying to understand
[442:45] um so that's
[442:51] thing here get sign URL promise
[442:57] um
[443:04] we should use the region
[443:14] oh okay okay oh yeah that's not here
[443:16] where I set it up this here
[443:21] actually I have no idea what the version
[443:23] it is
[443:25] the key
[443:27] is your peg you put the pocket content
[443:30] image key no no
[443:33] okay and then upload
[443:42] all right I'm gonna try adding the
[443:44] correct region
[443:45] um where do I get that thing
[443:49] Nexus
[444:02] here
[444:40] oh yeah here we go
[444:44] um workbook PDF Is Us East
[444:49] okay I'm gonna try that
[445:00] for the server just in case and try it
[445:02] again
[445:11] alrighty
[445:14] let's upload something
[445:18] that's the URL
[445:21] and now we get the same error
[445:23] I have a feeling I [ __ ] up somewhere
[445:26] easy Korean
[445:44] I'm gonna see if you guys sent some
[445:46] wiseness that I missed
[445:49] perhaps writing the region okay tricky
[445:53] project for PC
[445:58] if in the public read in any address if
[446:01] public trade has put objective put
[446:03] object is in there
[446:16] press East one
[446:18] is that so I try U.S east one I think
[446:26] or is that yeah that's that's what I try
[446:28] for the region I kind of it's the same
[446:31] code I use for other apps so I have a
[446:32] feeling I just [ __ ] up somewhere I put
[446:34] the wrong
[446:36] you know extension or the wrong
[446:37] something
[446:39] he said could that URL be
[446:48] it won't let me send anything to the oh
[446:52] no actually it does
[446:55] I just cannot copy past the URL okay
