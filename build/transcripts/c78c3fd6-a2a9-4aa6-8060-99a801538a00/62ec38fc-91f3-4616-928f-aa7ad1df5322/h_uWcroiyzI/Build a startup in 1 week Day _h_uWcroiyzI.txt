[00:09] are we live
[00:11] we are going to be live very soon
[00:13] I'll live very soon oh yeah there we go
[00:18] hello Twitter
[00:21] hello YouTube
[00:22] the life is back
[00:24] um
[00:26] so if you're tuning in for the first
[00:27] time I'm trying to build a small startup
[00:31] where you can grow an avatar when you
[00:33] work out whether it's cycling climbing
[00:35] running cycling whatever you want
[00:37] so you pick your avatar when you start
[00:39] and then you can expect experience uh as
[00:44] you reach your goal so you get to set up
[00:46] a goal like oh I want to cycle three
[00:48] times a week
[00:49] you're gonna have a number of points you
[00:51] can achieve in a week and then every
[00:52] time you complete the cycling you get
[00:55] some points and when you get the points
[00:57] you level up You Avatar gets bigger and
[01:00] bigger and if you don't show up if you
[01:02] don't stick your goal on Monday your
[01:03] avatar will lose some experience points
[01:05] and Shrink and the app will feature all
[01:09] users on leaderboards
[01:12] so you can play with friends or with
[01:14] just random users on the app I was stuck
[01:17] for a few days uh actually for a day and
[01:21] a half so yesterday and this morning uh
[01:23] with the authentication flow because the
[01:25] app will be
[01:27] um on web it's actually already
[01:29] available here the herofit that app and
[01:33] also it's going to be available in IOS
[01:36] and Android so this is the app in iOS I
[01:41] was stuck with the authentication flow I
[01:42] managed to fix it it's using the basic
[01:45] Json web token authentication flow so
[01:48] I'm using next JS API here for the back
[01:52] end it's sending when the user signs up
[01:55] or logs in it's sending some cookies and
[01:58] the cookies are stored somewhere in here
[02:01] and the user sends it back to the to the
[02:04] backend whenever he wants to make a
[02:07] request
[02:08] pages are generated on the front end
[02:13] because capacitor some features of
[02:16] ninjas won't work with capacitor so I
[02:19] have to make the request like basically
[02:23] it serves a blank page when the user
[02:25] will be in the Honey's dashboard and
[02:27] then you'll make a request to get the
[02:28] user data from the API
[02:31] uh so far I've tested the app on Android
[02:34] iOS and the web and it seems like the
[02:36] cookie stuffs are working so I'm gonna
[02:39] keep going that way for now
[02:43] if you are somewhere in here
[02:46] um drop say hello uh let me know what's
[02:49] your Twitter username
[02:50] not gonna work if I don't post of course
[02:54] because most uh most of them you guys
[02:57] will actually come from Twitter I think
[03:00] it's uh
[03:02] I think it would be smart to have it on
[03:04] Twitch when I figured out how it works
[03:07] um so yep we're good we are good
[03:13] um
[03:16] checking that everything is actually
[03:18] working
[03:21] either in here
[03:25] like your own post is very important
[03:27] and the app
[03:31] okay I think we can go on and start
[03:34] coding
[03:36] um so
[03:38] the app right now as just the basic
[03:41] features of plugging and logouts
[03:43] so it's ugly I'm gonna do the design
[03:46] later but you can sign in
[03:51] and sign up
[03:52] and it creates a record in the database
[03:55] and saves your token in a let's say so
[03:58] I'm gonna sign up instead
[04:00] this is not gonna work because the user
[04:02] exists up I'm signed up I can log out
[04:06] create support is just something that I
[04:09] have to code but it's basically calling
[04:10] the API
[04:12] and login again
[04:15] that's where we are
[04:18] um just checking the stream is working
[04:21] you are tuning in uh just let me know in
[04:24] the chats I'd love to know if things are
[04:25] going
[04:28] um
[04:29] it's
[04:30] a workout step where you can grow your
[04:34] own avatar it starts you pick an emoji
[04:36] of the workout you want to do and then
[04:38] you get experience points as you reach
[04:41] your goals so the Avatar gets more
[04:43] colors and bigger
[04:45] and you can increase your level up to
[04:47] level something we don't know yet what's
[04:49] the what's the end of the the game
[04:52] um and also you're gonna be able to see
[04:54] other people's avatars through
[04:56] leaderboards
[04:58] um still need to be figured out but I
[05:00] think they're going to be like a a
[05:02] little board for sports so we don't
[05:05] match all the sports so it's relevant to
[05:08] you and then you're gonna see the people
[05:12] of your current level
[05:14] in the leaderboard and you're going to
[05:16] see how much experience phones they have
[05:18] and how many times they've been cycling
[05:20] or whatever workout they do
[05:22] pretty much
[05:24] the app the goal is to make it in one
[05:25] week
[05:26] so that's a bit short so it's going to
[05:29] be really minimal in terms of features
[05:30] and uh now I have the basic login and
[05:33] logins inside of flow
[05:37] right and if the sound is good or not
[05:40] good just uh let me know if uh you know
[05:43] I can tweak something because it's my
[05:45] second stream ever
[05:48] so uh it might be a pretty bad streamer
[05:51] but looking to improve so let me know if
[05:52] uh if I can change something
[05:55] and also if my you know if you can see
[05:57] I'm gonna be coding mostly so if you can
[05:59] see stuff that I'm coding if it's not
[06:01] too small not too big
[06:05] okay hey Frank
[06:09] are you guys based Europe Morning Europe
[06:11] or maybe Asia
[06:22] if I want to see the chat rain and
[06:24] Island oh they're amazing so nice my my
[06:27] uh I'm French too
[06:29] and uh my grandpa lives in Arena Island
[06:31] at such a beautiful place
[06:33] and such a nice place to live
[06:37] okay maybe we can do something like this
[06:40] oh wow I've never been coding this way
[06:42] it is quite fun
[06:43] we can try this
[06:47] right you're right
[06:52] okay that seems to be working
[06:55] okay let's go
[06:57] um
[06:59] so we are we are we are here we gotta
[07:02] login
[07:03] um so the first thing I want to do for
[07:05] today is to let you just create their
[07:07] Sports so pick whatever Emoji they have
[07:11] um I think we're gonna need a model in
[07:13] the database so I'm using [ __ ] Mongoose
[07:15] to create models in the mongodb database
[07:19] so they're going to be a sports model
[07:23] is
[07:25] sport will represent one activity that
[07:27] you pick so uh if you're cycling I'm
[07:29] gonna create one document for cycling
[07:31] for you with the right emoji
[07:34] hello
[07:40] so it's going to be tied to a user
[07:43] uh and of course this is required we're
[07:46] gonna call it uh token complete Sports
[08:09] um
[08:10] all right so if you are here
[08:13] um this is what is going to look like
[08:14] you're gonna pick your emoji that
[08:16] represents a sport you do and it's going
[08:17] to level up with experience points
[08:20] um you you will though and the way to
[08:22] monetize this app
[08:24] um I think uh is that everybody can pick
[08:27] a sport for free and if you want to
[08:29] create more sports like let's say you
[08:30] cycle and you climb then there is a
[08:33] premium version of the app or let's say
[08:34] whatever 15 20 and the price you unlock
[08:38] the premium feature which means you can
[08:40] create unlimited uh exercises of sports
[08:44] so a sport will have uh will be tied to
[08:47] a user I think a sport will have its own
[08:49] experience points
[08:51] I'm gonna call it XP which is going to
[08:54] be type number
[08:57] which is not required because by default
[08:59] it's going to start at zero
[09:02] and uh we're gonna put it a mean of zero
[09:08] um how do we do that
[09:15] okay I think because there will be so
[09:17] there will be experience so
[09:19] you as a user get experience points so
[09:23] you have a goal to let's say do three
[09:26] workouts
[09:28] a three cycle
[09:30] three times cycle a week
[09:35] that's your goal
[09:38] and so what happens is that if you do it
[09:40] three times
[09:42] so let's take for instance if you do it
[09:44] 3x you're gonna get 100 100 XP if you do
[09:48] it
[09:49] 2X
[09:51] you're gonna get 66 expect
[09:54] if you do it
[09:56] One X you're gonna get Get It 33 spit
[10:02] and if you do it 0x then you're gonna
[10:05] lose minus 50 XP to make sure that you
[10:08] don't quit
[10:10] and you do it
[10:12] 7X
[10:14] let's say maybe 5x you're going to earn
[10:16] the same amount of EXP
[10:18] the goal for this
[10:21] is that people on the little board
[10:24] if someone is really heavy into workout
[10:27] and someone is pretty light what matters
[10:29] is how much they stick to their goals
[10:32] more than how much they do so to make it
[10:36] fair for everyone if I am you know
[10:38] cycling two times a week
[10:40] uh I have the same chains to have the
[10:44] same score of someone who is having a
[10:46] goal of Cycles seven times a week
[10:48] so it's fair and on the user profile
[10:52] it's gonna also display how many times
[10:53] you cycle so
[10:55] two people with the same number of
[10:57] experience
[10:58] can have a very different path so
[11:01] someone who is working out seven times a
[11:03] week will show a lot of workouts it can
[11:06] have the same level as someone who is
[11:08] only working on three times or two times
[11:09] a week so we are to make sure it's fair
[11:12] so what matter is the goal that you set
[11:14] up for you at the beginning when you
[11:16] start your habit
[11:17] so
[11:19] before we talk about XP um
[11:22] there's a goal the goal is a type number
[11:27] in the app or so it's a small app and
[11:29] the the we're going to take this um
[11:33] we're going to make it weekly stuff
[11:35] so you every users will track their
[11:38] because I think for workout it makes
[11:39] more sense to have something weekly so
[11:41] people will set up how many times a week
[11:42] they want to work out
[11:45] and then at the end of the week is or
[11:47] whatever is going to calculate your
[11:49] current experience points based on the
[11:51] gold you set up but the goal is type
[11:53] number
[11:57] um by Def there's no default but it's
[11:59] required
[12:01] you have when you create a sport an
[12:03] activity you need to tell uh how much
[12:05] you want to work out
[12:07] uh the minimum would be one time a week
[12:10] and the maximum will be seven
[12:13] every day
[12:16] um
[12:20] right
[12:21] sticking like everything is fine
[12:26] it's impossible two people from Union
[12:28] island in the chat we are like five and
[12:30] and
[12:31] Iranian Islands such a small place it's
[12:34] so fun
[12:35] pretty cool
[12:49] all right I think okay
[12:52] I think there is no need to track the
[12:55] level of the user
[12:57] in just the EXP
[13:00] o
[13:02] yeah XP will change every time you work
[13:04] out
[13:09] you
[13:10] complete you throw your XP
[13:18] right okay
[13:26] cannot be lower than zero and there is
[13:28] no maximum
[13:32] that means
[13:37] I think there will be a pattern that
[13:39] says okay
[13:49] so if you tell me how much xp you have
[13:51] and should be able to tell you what's
[13:53] your level so if you have 120 XP
[13:57] that means your level uh I haven't done
[14:00] it yet but probably something like your
[14:02] level five
[14:03] but if you have 20 XP you are level two
[14:08] so by just tracking the user XP I should
[14:11] be able to by having a simple script to
[14:15] tell the user's level
[14:17] how do I show the level up
[14:26] I think we can do this in the front side
[14:28] okay
[14:45] you start with zero XP
[14:52] you obviously indeed an emoji
[14:57] that represent the sport which is a
[14:59] guest type string
[15:01] and required
[15:03] true how do Emoji works
[15:06] it's a good question emojis uh HTML
[15:11] they said you have
[15:20] if you want to use it you can use a
[15:22] decimal execimal reference from table
[15:24] below okay
[15:30] we fight save this
[15:48] okay
[15:54] so I
[15:55] so I let's see emojis at least
[16:03] can I see the chat without
[16:06] going back in here
[16:08] um
[16:10] a girl timestamp nope
[16:15] I've got a YouTube
[16:17] oh maybe here
[16:27] how about that yes what you guys are
[16:29] saying now
[16:36] all right
[16:50] give it actually no
[16:56] GPS Sports
[17:04] in here
[17:13] and it's
[17:21] more cycling
[17:24] workouts oh we have to make the woman
[17:27] and the men stuff oh maybe we can pick
[17:29] no gender ones
[17:39] to own the many
[17:43] the Jim Rooney oh no maybe okay they are
[17:47] men swimmer
[17:49] the men swimmer is a black guy by
[17:51] default and the women he's a white guy
[17:54] by default so weird
[18:03] okay

[18:12] it's Fortune chili TV okay
[18:14] focusing at all
[18:18] crickets
[18:21] um
[18:24] I think we're gonna make it no gender no
[18:26] colors no skin color just a default one
[18:31] goes uh
[18:37] um
[18:44] spare
[18:55] originally without supporting us sorry

[20:40] know how the browser display those
[20:42] images
[21:53] foreign
[22:12] this is just a perfect summary
[22:45] I'm learning something today
[22:48] um
[23:00] all right pretty cool
[23:12] all right I'm in love with Emojis or
[23:20] so we need if it's okay that will be in
[23:24] the database the Emoji
[23:27] wait actually we don't need just the X
[23:29] good we just need to store when we need
[23:31] to find okay we need to find
[23:34] um we need a helper that represents all
[23:37] the images that will be in the app
[23:41] um
[23:42] we're gonna create
[23:44] really uh M Sports
[23:49] stats list equal
[23:52] and we are going to spend some time with
[23:54] all the Emojis
[24:07] [Music]
[24:11] sports for now
[24:14] okay
[24:15] you don't want to put that in here
[24:21] um
[24:23] Emoji will be this
[24:29] and uh ID will be soccer
[24:39] in the display name we're gonna say
[24:42] soccer
[24:46] doesn't matter it doesn't really matter
[24:47] but anyway I'm gonna do three like those
[24:50] just to start and making sure that uh
[24:52] it's on track uh men women and
[24:56] weight lifter okay
[25:01] that's gonna be a bunch of emoji at

[25:55] um goal
[26:01] way and one left nobody's five
[26:11] uh cycling
[26:13] oh man
[26:17] I'm gonna go with gender Mutual
[26:20] cyclist
[26:22] cycling
[26:30] in one last
[26:40] recycling in the mountain
[26:42] interesting I'll surf there we go
[26:51] well it's surfing
[26:54] and so my sport here Emoji it requires
[26:57] true enum
[26:59] and it Imports
[27:04] oh and we need to export that list
[27:08] or beasts
[27:23] helpers
[27:26] slash Sports
[27:30] um of emoji list that map
[27:43] if that's gonna work
[27:45] could be
[27:56] checking live stuff is working well
[28:03] it seems to be working well okay
[28:09] yeah
[28:12] um and why GSN not typescript just
[28:14] because I don't know type script
[28:22] oh yeah something important we're gonna
[28:24] track every time you
[28:27] the user
[28:29] owns the activity
[28:31] so we are going to need a
[28:34] um records maybe or an array of
[28:39] uh of another
[28:42] connection we're going to create
[28:46] uh
[28:48] so it's gonna be
[28:51] records
[28:55] oh yeah how did I do that on heavy skirt
[28:57] and how was it
[29:01] um you use
[29:07] let me use that model
[29:13] yeah we're gonna do that okay
[29:15] we're gonna create
[29:17] a shim a schema for
[29:23] uh for records
[29:26] so record is basically just
[29:29] you completed your habits this time this
[29:32] day and whatever area
[29:35] I'm gonna end this
[29:36] in the database
[29:39] well actually
[29:41] we want to do
[29:47] we make a separate collection or should
[29:50] we just add those directly
[29:53] onto the activity maybe we shouldn't
[29:55] bother too much for now
[29:59] because you can remove it eventually
[30:04] or you can
[30:33] oh no we're going to keep it this way
[30:34] record schema and we're gonna say that
[30:40] so these dates will be
[30:42] um
[30:43] the UTC timestamp
[30:46] we're going to add a time zone
[30:50] do we need the time zone
[30:53] not really for now
[30:55] okay
[30:59] type
[31:00] no need
[31:01] maybe later we'll need the time zone
[31:04] Channel
[31:06] and we are going to have a collections
[31:10] of record schema
[31:13] that how I do it I'll have its Garden or
[31:15] not
[31:19] um
[31:20] names invited by the following
[31:24] names
[31:26] that seems to be working okay so we have
[31:28] a model for sport
[31:32] we need to create a sport
[31:34] all right I think what we're gonna do
[31:38] um in this we're gonna create a page
[31:46] that's
[31:47] our app
[31:49] we're gonna create a create
[31:52] Sports the G is
[31:57] function
[32:01] oh okay yeah it doesn't like this
[32:06] it doesn't matter
[32:16] from the dashboard when you click create
[32:19] sport
[32:20] it's gonna be instead a link
[32:32] enemy and a trip
[32:36] of the app that's
[32:39] create
[32:44] uh animator
[32:47] okay we have a page creates support
[32:53] all right so we need uh from the user
[32:55] what we need we need
[32:58] the Emoji the user wants to pick
[33:02] up we need
[33:03] [Music]
[33:04] a goal how many times a week
[33:07] and that's pretty much it yes
[33:16] missing on I'll be right back into the
[33:18] bathroom
[34:27] hey thank you look man
[34:33] you guys think it's interesting um I was
[34:36] thinking I could once I'm done coding
[34:38] I can do the whole process of creating
[34:40] the landing page and um creating the
[34:43] demo video
[34:44] uh things that are not coding but just
[34:46] uh launching it actually on product
[34:48] hunts live in here on YouTube if you
[34:51] think it's interesting
[34:58] Eddie right so
[35:04] um
[35:07] how do we do that
[35:10] there will be tons of emojis for sport
[35:13] I'll be the best way
[35:18] we're actually gonna need Imports um
[35:45] maybe we don't think so much for now
[35:46] we'll see
[35:48] um what we're gonna do we're gonna say
[35:55] wait a minute
[35:57] create your
[36:02] workouts Avatar
[36:11] um we're gonna have a div
[36:13] and these div will be a mapping of all
[36:16] the least we're going to delete that map
[36:22] um so for each sport we're going to have
[36:26] a another div
[36:33] uh s dots
[36:36] oh geez
[36:37] and here gonna be ID I know it's key I
[36:41] think
[36:42] your idea I don't remember anyway you
[36:44] will tell me
[36:45] yes that
[36:47] I think we called it
[36:49] idea
[36:54] we have Emoji here we have emojis nice
[36:57] and react is not complaining so we're
[36:59] good
[37:01] um
[37:02] last name those are going to be ours
[37:06] somehow so heading for text LG
[37:14] gonna be uh what are we gonna do we're
[37:16] gonna do a greed
[37:18] because we'll see later I think
[37:20] read
[37:23] holes
[37:25] green row
[37:28] maybe a work
[37:31] now we're gonna do Flex
[37:36] or
[37:38] and uh let's wrap
[37:48] bingo
[37:56] or Excel
[37:59] dingo [ __ ]
[38:07] um
[38:11] you can do something like something very
[38:13] simple just for now
[38:15] sore
[38:20] in Excel
[38:23] be cute
[38:25] we're gonna do the whole design
[38:27] afterward
[38:29] for now I'm just trying to
[38:32] do the really basic
[38:36] Ally
[38:48] okay so when you pick it
[38:50] um we are going to have
[38:54] we need this and the goal so import use
[38:57] State react
[39:00] uh we're gonna have the sport and set
[39:03] Sports
[39:06] [ __ ]
[39:08] by default is going to be nothing
[39:12] we are going to have
[39:14] um
[39:15] your goal
[39:20] at gold and I think this one's by
[39:22] default we can put three because by
[39:24] default we can offer people to have a
[39:26] three times a week workouts
[39:30] all right you don't like it there which
[39:32] has a state of value
[39:37] getting all the words
[39:39] fateful value
[39:52] I'm getting old
[40:01] oh maybe it's because of this
[40:10] right
[40:13] already right
[40:17] so you have here
[40:21] so on click
[40:24] um we're gonna do
[40:27] this
[40:32] sit uh set sport
[40:35] that I
[40:38] missed it
[40:40] hey I think we're going to save the IDS
[40:42] in the database
[40:44] it'll make more sense
[40:46] and the US
[40:50] yeah so later I can in case I can change
[40:52] okay
[40:58] and so in here we would have something
[41:01] like this and if
[41:04] um
[41:05] If Sports
[41:09] equal at s dot ID
[41:12] we're gonna give it a
[41:14] maybe background
[41:17] order two
[41:20] yeah that doesn't make much sense
[41:26] um
[41:30] I've got no sense Circle it's
[41:33] what is it point
[41:36] what is it ring
[41:41] all right
[41:44] your emoji
[41:54] as first step
[41:56] the second step is to pick
[42:00] the
[42:02] number of times you want to work out
[42:05] maybe I can feel what I did perhaps it's
[42:07] Garden
[42:09] um
[42:11] frequency
[42:13] where was it
[42:18] you
[42:26] know okay
[42:33] am I gonna break something
[42:35] that's cool
[42:39] seems like a good work here we have
[42:42] okay
[42:58] next a week all right we're gonna make
[43:01] it select borders MD select e
[43:06] with hold it
[43:10] right
[43:19] all right this is not the best design
[43:20] ever but this is functional
[43:23] and select your avatar
[43:25] you can see how many times a week you
[43:27] wanna do it
[43:30] um
[43:31] I'm going to need a button just submit
[43:35] create
[43:37] uh
[43:42] maybe we need
[43:45] I know I think that's clear right
[43:47] he
[43:49] you guys see any
[43:52] um anything that could be improved or
[43:54] the design is definitely not done but in
[43:57] terms of like a functional like could
[43:58] you can you understand actually what's
[44:00] going on in here
[44:13] I think maybe like this
[44:28] going to be all right now that seems
[44:30] good
[44:31] um let me check if I'm not missing
[44:32] anything
[44:37] onboarding screen to me
[44:40] hey hey you're back
[44:43] um
[44:44] yeah it's kind of an onboarding screen
[44:46] you're basically picking the Avatar you
[44:47] want
[44:50] uh oh we need also a button
[44:58] to go back uh we are going
[45:08] um what is the icon is going to be back
[45:12] maybe Arrow
[45:16] this one doesn't work this one may be
[45:18] better
[45:27] hey okay it's not super sexy but it's
[45:29] working
[45:37] because how do people usually
[45:53] maybe something like this
[46:10] all right
[46:30] uh all right we'll fix it later
[46:32] anyway that's working
[46:36] I'm gonna create a link as well
[46:38] that link here
[46:41] would actually start a button it's a
[46:43] link
[46:48] oops
[46:57] here you go back to the app okay
[47:00] all righty
[47:01] so
[47:03] now we need to submit
[47:06] on stand handle or create
[47:14] or just console Vlog for now
[47:18] board
[47:27] if I don't want to create the function
[47:30] color it's not going to work
[47:32] like
[47:37] three okay so the goal the sport has not
[47:40] been picked up oh yeah ready and pick it
[47:42] up of course it's not gonna work
[47:46] okay both
[47:48] perfect
[48:04] right
[48:10] perfect
[48:12] um
[48:15] all right so we need to create a
[48:17] function on the an API route
[48:22] um which is going to be somewhere
[48:23] somewhere somewhere somewhere Sports
[48:25] perfect creates
[48:27] I know we said of course database and
[48:29] Authentication
[48:32] and we need requested buddy.sport and
[48:35] requested buddy.com
[48:38] picking if the authentication is
[48:40] actually kicking the user out
[48:43] get Authentication
[48:46] editor if not okay
[49:02] okay
[49:10] we are checking that we have what we
[49:12] need in the body which I can wait we
[49:13] have the user that requested user is
[49:16] actually something that is being
[49:17] populated through the cookies that is
[49:20] being sent they have a little middleware
[49:22] so it's not even a middleware with a
[49:24] function that's called get oath that's
[49:26] going to check in the header
[49:28] let's take the cookie I'm gonna decode
[49:31] it and find the user in the database and
[49:34] attach the user to the requests object
[49:37] which means that where we're going to
[49:39] create
[49:40] we're going to call this function to
[49:42] create a sport
[49:44] here we tell that we want to set up the
[49:47] authentication stuff with the true and
[49:49] normally the request the user should be
[49:51] populated
[49:53] it's not it's gonna re send this back
[49:56] and normally on the client if I get
[49:58] these back
[50:00] I get a 401. I'm gonna push back to the
[50:05] login screen because the user is not
[50:07] logged in it doesn't have the right
[50:10] token
[50:12] so now we have this
[50:15] um
[50:16] we're gonna do something like this
[50:17] import sport
[50:19] um and push port
[50:25] uh we're gonna do something instance
[50:28] sport equal
[50:33] weight
[50:34] support dot create we're gonna need to
[50:36] pass the object which is uh request a
[50:40] body
[50:41] uh so let's check it again
[50:44] sport has user gold emojis
[50:49] uh so we need user we need goal and we
[50:53] need emoji
[50:59] user the goal the Emoji
[51:03] really I'm being a bit picky but I think
[51:06] rather see this one first
[51:10] create the user so the user will be a
[51:14] request.user.id
[51:18] bies like this
[51:20] I have to check
[51:21] the Emoji would be the request.body DOT
[51:27] Sports
[51:28] and
[51:33] the
[51:35] oh maybe I'm not I'm not going to call
[51:37] it Emoji I think I'm just going to call
[51:39] it idea
[51:40] sport ID
[51:43] and we're gonna use this thing here
[51:46] I can use it yeah I can change the Emoji
[51:48] later
[51:54] all right we're going to call it ID oh
[51:56] we need to refresh this otherwise next
[51:58] we'll cache it
[52:01] and we're going to create so we have the
[52:04] user the ID
[52:07] and the goal which is request.body.goth
[52:13] if everything is going fine we're going
[52:15] to
[52:16] uh user model normally has a list of
[52:20] sports yep
[52:23] we're gonna do user
[52:25] request dot user dots Sports
[52:31] correct
[52:36] of course okay yeah request.t user.sport
[52:39] dot push
[52:43] um
[52:44] pushing we're gonna push it the new
[52:47] sport.id
[52:50] and we are going to do requested user
[52:53] that's same and we're gonna await that
[52:57] then we're gonna send back
[53:03] yes
[53:06] this board that was created okay it
[53:08] might be a bit sketchy let me think
[53:12] actually work out
[53:15] not perfect
[53:18] it should work
[53:26] okay right
[53:29] um
[53:36] here
[53:38] where are we
[53:49] are going to import the API client
[53:55] here we are going to do
[53:58] instance
[54:03] API clients.host
[54:08] we're going to post on
[54:11] uh sport dot create slash create
[54:19] find the
[54:21] of the user input
[54:24] of course it needs to be a sync
[54:28] it needs to be bound to create Avatar
[54:31] okay
[54:33] and we are going to log this console log
[54:37] support
[54:38] and we'll do the redirect after if that
[54:40] works
[54:41] all right three two one nope I need to
[54:44] pick a sport three two one there you go
[54:46] hey of course
[54:48] and I think it's important before
[54:50] initialize
[54:52] or before initialize so you don't have
[54:55] access to this
[54:58] oh oh yeah okay okay
[55:04] again
[55:09] you can go
[55:11] um what do we have in the back end
[55:16] apparently is not part of the image
[55:19] released
[55:22] um
[55:22] okay okay that makes sense it's because
[55:24] here we said it's gonna be an emoji but
[55:27] no
[55:28] we need to do an Indian for the IDS
[55:31] all right fingers crossed straight to
[55:33] one
[55:34] bingo
[55:36] Donuts
[55:40] okay
[55:43] um let's be curious and just do
[55:45] something like this
[55:49] log what is actually being returned
[55:51] there
[55:59] yeah
[56:00] okay you're not gonna read oh yeah I
[56:03] know I don't know I have to
[56:05] restart
[56:09] right three two one
[56:11] bingo
[56:12] Donuts
[56:15] see
[56:22] create okay so import paste
[56:30] least uh so what we're gonna do we're
[56:32] going to do console log
[56:36] request that buddy
[56:38] .org
[56:41] and we're going to load
[56:55] and I'll show you what you got
[56:58] there we can
[57:15] yep okay I think I understand what I did
[57:19] wrong
[57:20] wait no
[57:29] rematch sport
[57:32] far away mister
[57:37] oh you don't want to let me important
[57:39] thing
[57:43] for now
[57:45] show me what you read
[57:57] sport

[58:44] Surf Soccer weightlifter golf okay so we
[58:48] have the ID that's right
[58:58] I don't care anymore
[59:04] alrighty right so we got back
[59:08] um and now we're gonna check the
[59:09] database making sure that this board was
[59:11] created the user has everything it needs
[59:13] I'm running a local database for mongodb
[59:19] uh nope even refresh

[63:48] we need to populate
[63:50] the user Sports and we are here loading
[63:56] error message nice
[63:59] logouts
[64:00] B2B
[64:05] um
[64:07] you're logged in
[64:19] and we are going to do something like
[64:22] this
[64:23] um user
[64:25] data data
[64:27] the data I think it's the it's actually
[64:30] the user
[64:35] so to get back from the database so
[64:37] we're going to do data dots Sports
[64:44] dot map
[64:50] or submap and we're going to do for each
[64:52] sport we can
[64:58] import
[65:00] uh as for that ID that would be enough
[65:06] babies
[65:15] and key
[65:20] or dot ID
[65:29] right
[65:31] um and we're going to do some heading
[65:33] for
[65:37] so we need to populate the user Sports
[65:41] on here
[65:43] uh
[65:45] as a user and here so we have the user
[65:48] we need to do request a user.opulate
[65:53] think a path
[65:57] forward
[66:00] yep
[66:05] would that do
[66:07] they await or no
[66:10] it's always a good question
[66:12] um Happy's Garden what are you doing
[66:14] nervous hope you're late
[66:17] patient
[66:21] I'm happy that's funny that's great
[66:25] all right we'll try both okay
[66:39] execute it
[66:46] hey
[67:12] like
[67:16] well give me something
[67:23] you're not even checking this
[67:25] stuff
[67:30] nothing went wrong yeah that's correct
[67:33] set defaults
[67:35] could have gone wrong in here
[67:46] um
[67:52] oh wait I think I made a mistake
[68:05] my function
[68:07] to be externally oath
[68:15] throws an error
[68:32] user is not defined
[68:36] yes
[68:38] alrighty
[68:47] oh I have those two things
[68:55] the way the population
[69:05] all right looks like if your weight
[69:07] works and if we don't
[69:09] work right
[69:12] it doesn't work okay so we have to await
[69:13] the population
[69:18] and we send back request dot user
[69:22] with an array of
[69:27] here
[69:33] [Music]
[69:36] and we have H4 okay
[69:43] um
[69:50] I get my sport back
[69:54] in my data right
[69:58] data user
[70:01] reports
[70:03] all right that's ID
[70:07] oh I made a mistake
[70:11] yep is this is not going to work I need
[70:13] to change to Emoji ID
[70:17] ID because it's going to conflict with
[70:20] mongodb IDs
[70:22] which are trans transcoded to normally
[70:27] there's a slash but I use a two Json
[70:29] plugin that makes it just ID or
[70:31] simplicity
[70:32] and they're going to be an issue with
[70:34] the Emoji ID otherwise so I need to
[70:36] change that uh
[70:40] and I need to change it also in the
[70:43] create port
[70:46] and I'll just create API
[70:50] image ID
[70:53] okay
[71:27] Lisbon from London that's so nice you
[71:31] have to be here
[71:33] Your Entertainment during this light
[71:39] I hope you can see something on the
[71:41] screen
[71:42] it's not too small
[71:57] maybe we have an issue with uh
[72:00] we need to drop
[72:02] Sports
[72:07] maybe the user needs to
[72:09] IDs you have
[72:12] a
[72:25] nope you still don't like it so what's
[72:27] going on
[72:30] I'm using schema here
[72:32] you might have been Georgia search for
[72:34] model Sports
[72:36] what do you mean it hasn't been or I
[72:38] just
[72:39] watching sports
[72:45] it has been registered
[72:57] when you get the user
[73:16] recreate
[73:24] with you menu
[73:31] oh you think it has a cache like it's
[73:33] caching the previous
[73:35] stuff maybe empty cache and we'll see
[73:43] you know it's still being depresented
[73:47] oh actually
[73:51] schema hasn't been reviewed from the
[73:53] sport
[73:57] to create an account with the image ID
[74:02] it's the entry
[74:07] with the image it's the intro you have
[74:11] ready
[74:13] but I I think I've deleted
[74:15] all those
[74:18] wait
[74:20] a minute
[74:23] because normally the user doesn't have
[74:25] the Emoji ID on his
[74:27] model so the user here is a oh maybe
[74:30] from previous users
[74:33] maybe it will just drop everyone
[74:37] bye users
[74:43] let's give it a try
[74:46] um sign up instead
[74:51] I know it's different
[74:55] hasn't been registered for model Sports
[74:58] in ux
[75:07] that depends when I query the user API
[75:12] that happens here
[75:16] 's the error
[75:18] um
[75:21] request a user I think it's happening
[75:23] somewhere here
[75:26] as course
[75:31] as oath
[75:38] would that be the thing
[75:43] oh that's the population on
[75:48] what
[75:49] it's not supposed to throw an error
[75:53] request a user that populates
[75:59] why did you throw an Airman
[76:13] that means if there are no scheme
[76:26] okay bro if
[76:32] doesn't mean registered oh okay so if
[76:34] you've never seen this schema
[76:40] answered
[76:54] hey
[76:56] yeah I know I know I think type scripted
[76:58] something you understand after you've
[77:00] you've done it like
[77:04] like you trade and then you realize that
[77:06] all the times you could have saved in
[77:08] the past
[77:12] um
[78:11] oh
[78:12] damn it
[78:18] oh maybe in my defaults
[78:21] uh my database or something
[78:25] in the [ __ ] Imports
[78:30] user and I import
[78:33] s
[78:36] so maybe
[78:39] okay
[78:41] all right this is pointless but at least
[78:43] it has created the schema
[78:52] okay I think uh something
[78:55] uh
[78:57] let's see create sport
[79:00] I'm doing slipper
[79:03] three one time a week
[79:06] my avatar
[79:08] here it is
[79:10] um
[79:15] what are you where are you
[79:20] yes
[79:29] you mean that emoji
[79:34] uh
[79:40] at least
[79:49] oh yeah we need that
[79:53] um what is it upper level
[79:59] we need a finder
[80:02] and get a sport
[80:06] you give me the ID and I will answer
[80:09] back with
[80:11] [Music]
[80:13] indoor filter
[80:28] just fine
[80:32] first element okay
[80:35] simple as this list
[80:39] nope
[80:42] is that
[80:44] find
[80:45] uh
[80:47] each element I'm gonna
[80:49] let's
[80:51] ID
[80:53] idea
[80:55] I'm gonna export these at Port
[81:01] so in here we're gonna get it's
[81:04] sport
[81:06] and we're gonna do getsport
[81:11] that's that ID is
[81:16] Emoji ID
[81:18] the naming is already terrible
[81:21] by doing wrong here
[81:24] yep we have to return this
[81:28] uh and of course this is going to be
[81:33] um
[81:37] the Emoji
[81:42] A and B plus
[81:47] for excel
[81:49] okay
[81:54] okay we're gonna create more Sports
[82:02] oh right seems like it's working and
[82:04] maybe we display underneath we are going
[82:06] to have very simple stuff uh text for
[82:09] opening for
[82:13] a grown please
[82:17] 100 rounded pixel
[82:20] X4
[82:22] uh
[82:25] maybe we don't we don't need that
[82:28] I'm gonna do p
[82:36] and do this
[82:38] and we are going to do it
[82:44] just for display takes four Excel and
[82:47] here we are going to show uh
[82:50] Sports dot goal X
[82:54] per week
[82:58] right this is not working
[83:03] uh hit sport
[83:26] with B somewhere no
[83:34] are you
[83:36] wait what am I doing heading for okay
[83:57] come on Mark
[84:03] email to me of course I'm so stupid uh
[84:07] there we go
[84:09] damn it
[84:11] thanks uh I get four
[84:18] Center
[84:27] all right this is a sport I do perfect
[84:33] I think we have Goods we're good for the
[84:35] sports we can create more
[84:37] Michael
[84:40] uh cycle three times
[84:45] a
[84:52] a
[84:54] um
[85:02] have four seven times a week
[85:08] create support
[85:11] array of
[85:13] seven
[85:18] all right
[85:21] being back uh you're logged in Data
[85:24] Center
[85:30] okay
[85:33] is that my workouts
[85:36] great Sports
[85:38] go back
[85:40] is
[85:44] all right I think I made a mistake in my
[85:45] code somewhere
[85:47] um I removed the cookie
[85:54] if I try to create a sport it's not
[85:57] going to redirect
[86:07] what is actually going on
[86:16] anyway it's working
[86:27] what happened
[86:36] no I was talking about yeah I think
[86:38] that's where I made a mistake said in
[86:40] defaults
[86:50] instead
[86:53] if I create again you're never gonna
[86:56] redirect me right
[87:02] you're sending me back and forth
[87:05] zero zero
[87:09] um
[87:11] eight
[87:13] I'm sending me back
[87:15] oh yeah okay yeah that makes sense
[87:17] now if I do this
[87:19] oh you redirect me
[87:27] weird
[87:38] how come you're sending me back or oh
[87:40] one
[87:46] who is sending me back 401
[87:49] Indians
[87:57] oh you're not gonna make an error
[88:00] no you are are you
[88:21] oh okay
[88:23] okay that throws an error but I catch it
[88:25] okay
[88:27] all right so the code is right
[88:29] code is right
[88:33] and on creates okay
[88:38] okay so that seems to be working
[88:42] um
[88:43] see
[88:47] we are going to try the code on mobile
[88:51] just to see I think I approached here
[88:53] it's live
[88:56] yeah it's live so we're gonna do
[89:00] this is where capacitor is normally so
[89:02] amazing
[89:04] um I just exported my code
[89:07] I'm gonna sign up
[89:09] oh maybe we can already have an account
[89:11] now we're gonna sign up
[89:14] dot fr
[89:24] okay
[89:26] um in Creative Sports
[89:30] and I do it three times a week
[89:33] and dingo
[89:40] and this is live this is actually uh
[89:42] using a real this is a using the next.js
[89:45] API
[89:47] um The herofit.app Domain so this is the
[89:50] real database
[89:52] uh
[89:55] yep and I had to select from iOS
[90:01] alrighty
[90:03] seems like it's going okay
[90:08] great sport
[90:18] all right
[90:19] um
[90:23] I think I need some peanut butter
[90:40] all right after that what we're gonna do
[90:42] we are going to create an API route for
[90:45] people to
[90:46] take their habit
[90:54] yep
[91:44] yeah I think I need some peanut butter
[91:47] I'll be back in a minute
[99:15] good morning Luca
[99:17] um usually two meals a day but I snack a
[99:21] lot in between
[99:22] drink a lot of milk maybe a liter of
[99:24] milk a day and I always have a break for
[99:26] peanut butter with
[99:28] bananas
[100:27] yeah yeah one liter of dairy milk yeah I
[100:30] don't know if it's a good thing or not
[100:31] but
[100:33] I'm gonna put some reason I love milk
[100:56] alrighty we are back
[101:09] so
[101:17] so those are my sports
[101:22] um I don't want to be able to track them
[101:23] now
[101:42] I'm gonna need a routes
[101:44] sports sports create
[101:49] uh let's call it track
[101:51] let me just add record that would make
[101:53] sense
[102:01] copy this I'm gonna pass it there
[102:08] um
[102:12] gold that doesn't matter oh yeah we need
[102:15] um
[102:23] yeah we need the requested buddy that's
[102:27] uh sport ID
[102:42] we need the sport ID which we're gonna
[102:45] add in the body it's not the cleanest
[102:47] but it's gonna work
[102:48] we need the user
[102:51] all right and now we need to perform
[102:53] some kind of check so
[102:56] what
[102:58] hey nope
[103:01] so we want to make sure
[103:06] that the user can't
[103:08] do more
[103:09] than once a day
[103:16] and what we're going to do
[103:19] so we need to check when are the last
[103:21] three chords okay
[103:22] then
[103:24] we are going to check
[103:27] um
[103:35] so if it didn't track for today you can
[103:38] add a record so we can add the record
[103:41] our soul
[103:44] and then we are going to check how much
[103:46] XP
[103:48] XP earned
[103:52] right
[103:54] following the same pattern we said so if
[103:57] you over
[103:59] over reach
[104:01] goal
[104:04] zero xB
[104:08] otherwise
[104:10] it calculates
[104:12] less if it's less than your goal so if
[104:14] it's like your
[104:16] lit or equal than your goal so if you
[104:18] have worked out three times in your goal
[104:20] with three workouts a day a week
[104:22] less than your goal
[104:25] then
[104:26] you earn x y z
[104:30] we need to calculate each space so XYZ
[104:36] Ed
[104:51] and
[105:06] right and I think there I don't know
[105:10] what's the best way but I think we're
[105:12] fetching on the front and the user data
[105:17] so what we could do
[105:19] either we make two API calls the first
[105:22] one updates the record so the first one
[105:25] calls this function
[105:28] and add a record
[105:29] and then when he comes back you refetch
[105:32] the user data to update the front end
[105:34] or in here we update eventually update
[105:40] I mean populate
[105:43] return updated user
[105:46] data because the two data that will
[105:48] change is the
[105:52] yeah maybe we'll just return the goal
[105:54] return the updated user data so we have
[105:57] two new data we have new XP plus new
[106:00] record
[106:05] maybe we just returned the sports
[106:10] and on the front end side when you're
[106:12] going to call that we're going to update
[106:14] the user I don't know how we're going to
[106:15] use their data [ __ ]
[106:19] um
[106:21] all right we'll figure it out later
[106:26] oh I
[106:38] oh the time zone stuff
[106:42] big deal
[106:46] should we send time zone
[106:50] um
[107:01] do we know how do we know if the user in
[107:03] is the right time zone
[107:15] maybe that should be connected to the
[107:17] user accounts
[107:20] May
[107:25] gonna do that
[107:32] yeah we're gonna have to do that we're
[107:34] gonna have to get the user time zone
[107:37] when the user creates an account
[107:40] because we only want we can only verify
[107:42] this
[107:46] and then okay
[107:52] oh man look at whoa sorry sorry bro
[108:09] oh that's smart bro
[108:19] yeah that's smart
[108:21] yeah easy recipes for Indie hackers
[108:23] something easy you can you can cook so
[108:25] good because having a chef is not very
[108:26] common
[108:32] I think that expands to India hacker and
[108:35] just remote people in general
[108:37] to work from home
[108:41] what
[108:46] could be a stream idea
[108:51] okay so
[108:52] um when we sign up
[109:06] we need to pass on a time zone here
[109:09] which is uh how to get user time zone
[109:15] I get user type
[109:18] oh wait I think I'm doing it I'll have
[109:20] its Garden
[109:25] same Zone
[109:27] yep moment that case that time zone
[109:35] moment moment yeah we need the moment
[109:37] time zone library then
[109:40] we have it maybe
[109:45] package moment
[109:47] we don't
[109:50] uh moment
[109:59] ready right so when you sign up you are
[110:02] going to import
[110:05] moment time zone
[110:13] and you are going to send the database
[110:16] here times a moment the time zone but
[110:18] guess how does it work
[110:21] all right
[110:22] you don't want to come back to your bike
[110:31] hey uh Mr B the brother is uh it's just
[110:35] a split screen
[110:37] I don't know if I can show you but
[110:40] basically uh this is vs code
[110:43] and if I
[110:46] take a browser tab
[110:49] I sent there on my OS it just split
[110:52] screens
[110:54] and here I can't because I already done
[110:56] it basically that's how it works
[111:03] at moment
[111:05] I'm Zone yes
[111:35] oh okay so moment time zone guess
[111:40] um on the sign up maybe on the user
[111:43] model
[111:45] we are going to have a little
[111:48] time zone thing
[111:54] uh which is going to be type num string
[111:57] be required true
[112:00] user
[112:05] time zone type TZ
[112:12] default validates moment time zone value
[112:17] all right we're not going to bother with
[112:18] this we can we can bother yes we will
[112:21] bother okay
[112:22] could be best
[112:24] Game Zone require true
[112:30] validate value return moment names okay
[112:36] Bingo oops
[112:45] and then when we sign up the user
[112:56] we need
[112:59] or nope
[113:00] okay
[113:05] API oauth requisite eraser or
[113:09] request
[113:16] buddy the same Zone evenly parameters
[113:20] and we are going to give it request.body
[113:25] that time zone
[113:28] let's give it a try create another
[113:31] account
[113:37] okay save and we're gonna check in the
[113:40] database if we have the user time zone
[113:45] user user user refresh that thing
[113:53] oh we don't have the time zone because I
[113:55] didn't refresh the models
[113:58] do it again
[114:01] App instead
[114:04] in
[114:06] I think something went wrong
[114:13] oh maybe you're not ready
[114:16] no you already user validation fails
[114:21] time zone is recorded at all what are
[114:24] you sending me
[114:28] you're saying it to me oh no it's a
[114:30] validation thing that is not working
[114:40] the user or the user is there
[114:47] are true validate
[114:51] show me what you got bro value
[115:03] hey Gail nice man the weekly goal I
[115:06] think is the way to go for motivation
[115:12] right sign up
[115:15] did you get in here
[115:20] is required I give it to you bro
[115:24] Eric
[115:34] oh
[115:37] uh okay I mean a noob email
[115:43] s word
[115:47] Game Zone maybe that would
[115:52] how come I can get this was working
[116:04] okay let's try it again
[116:06] still not
[116:18] what's going on
[116:23] a string to be a face
[116:25] to string file for value
[116:30] a project at best email
[116:43] what is going on email where is that
[116:45] thing did I set up emails
[116:48] yep I did
[116:50] password Game Zone
[116:53] I'm gonna log this thing out
[117:02] oh okay I think I know what's going on
[117:06] with me
[117:12] okay
[117:15] you don't remember what I
[117:17] created the other day create user from
[117:20] user lib
[117:23] yep that's what was missing I don't
[117:26] think that's a really needy function
[117:28] here it's
[117:33] I'll do it okay
[117:35] now are you supposed to be working
[117:38] Donuts
[117:43] sign up create user
[117:48] cookies okay so what is that number one
[117:51] here
[117:56] that's something wrong
[117:59] um
[118:02] okay
[118:05] it was always a one there
[118:08] who knows why
[118:10] these are gonna create email password
[118:12] time zone
[118:14] maybe we're gonna console log this
[118:18] validation film for what
[118:22] reference console is not different oh
[118:25] now what you're trying to do
[118:28] I know you're going to work
[118:32] three two one go
[118:35] it works and Normandy as a user I have
[118:41] Amazon Asia okay
[118:44] here we go we have a time zoom for users
[118:50] Alex
[118:52] um yep I'm using OBS it's my setup here
[118:59] and um yeah I think it could be used
[119:01] with Super Bass
[119:03] um the reason I'm using [ __ ] is because
[119:06] I'm trying to go very low
[119:09] framework
[119:11] because it's going to be available on
[119:13] IOS and Android and I'm using capacitor
[119:16] technology for that
[119:17] and so it's the more usually the more
[119:19] you add the more complicated it gets so
[119:21] here it's just I exchanged GWT tokens
[119:24] with the back end
[119:26] and and I I don't know I think I heard
[119:29] like super bass and Firebase I've had
[119:30] some issues with capacitor so I'm trying
[119:33] to use like a very the least framework I
[119:35] can
[119:38] we have the user time zone Perfecto
[119:40] perfect
[119:42] um
[119:43] so what we need to do we need to
[119:47] go back
[119:48] to the record stuff and check when was
[119:50] the last time the user edit record uh
[119:55] first
[119:59] need request the user
[120:02] only to populate
[120:05] the sports user does
[120:09] a user.populate
[120:13] I think I can do something like this
[120:15] Sports
[120:17] and console log
[120:22] user
[120:26] boards
[120:28] let's see that works or not uh and on my
[120:31] hand
[120:32] here
[120:35] I'm gonna do
[120:37] index page
[120:43] I am going to
[120:46] add some kind of uh
[120:49] button that says at record
[120:58] an SM on click
[121:05] add record
[121:09] and then
[121:11] in here we're going to have
[121:15] sent add record
[121:20] oh yeah we need to know we need to tell
[121:22] him which
[121:25] that record with s dots ID I guess
[121:32] yeah the idea of
[121:34] what you want
[121:36] ports ID and we're gonna do a weight
[121:40] uh API client
[121:46] .host
[121:48] and we're gonna post on
[121:51] um
[121:52] sport at
[121:55] record
[121:57] with
[121:59] as a parameter the how do we call it
[122:02] here
[122:03] Port ID
[122:06] sport idea
[122:08] and I'm gonna declare this as an etsync
[122:11] function
[122:22] right
[122:23] this is ugly that's perfect
[122:27] what we got here
[122:29] we can add a record and we populate the
[122:33] user and there we go we have the sports
[122:35] perfect
[122:38] you know what we need to do
[123:14] quick
[123:17] quick checkup for the surfer tomorrow
[123:22] let's say
[123:23] oh that's pretty good
[123:36] to be able to Surf tomorrow and it's a
[123:38] beautiful thing
[123:45] yes in
[123:49] um all right so we have the sports
[123:55] we have to pick up the sport the user
[123:58] said he wants to track constants Sports
[124:01] to update
[124:03] then we're gonna do
[124:05] [Music]
[124:07] request.user.sport.filter to find
[124:11] um for each Sports sport
[124:15] ID equal
[124:19] and you're gonna getting the
[124:22] request.body.sport idea
[124:25] and I think we need some kind of
[124:28] transformation because it's a mongoose
[124:31] mongoose
[124:35] object ID to string
[124:44] there we go blue string
[124:59] yep we have it nice
[125:02] if I do multiple spores weight lifter if
[125:05] I golf
[125:06] I had a record for golf yep that's the
[125:09] right one okay
[125:14] let's do more than once a day so we're
[125:16] gonna import obviously
[125:20] moment
[125:30] um
[125:34] check
[125:38] something like starts today for
[125:42] user
[125:44] so that's gonna be the start of the day
[125:46] for the user and we're going to need to
[125:47] check that the last record of that
[125:49] workout habit was
[125:52] after that so start day for user we're
[125:55] gonna do moments dots start off
[126:02] um moments
[126:06] right you need to put it in the user
[126:08] time zone
[126:10] um
[126:12] save me
[126:15] uh start of day
[126:26] yeah okay that's what I do
[126:33] all right so we check
[126:34] the current time of the day
[126:37] in the user time zone
[126:40] then we check when he's a third of the
[126:42] day so let's try if we console log base
[126:44] for me
[126:45] knowing that I am in Asia
[126:52] something went wrong these are oh yeah
[126:55] request a user the time zone
[127:07] moment uh
[127:10] okay
[127:12] that's great
[127:13] that's my time zone so that's the start
[127:15] of my day
[127:18] um so now I need to check that
[127:22] I'll set less record
[127:25] all uh Sports
[127:37] are different user instance
[127:40] has completed
[127:43] date
[127:45] we're going to do
[127:47] either request a user that's no export
[127:51] to update
[127:56] now to recourse so that they're all the
[127:58] list of all the records the user has
[128:01] um
[128:02] let's say either there's no record oh
[128:05] thanks now we're going to do that
[128:08] links
[128:20] Superior zero
[128:26] update record those things so we have
[128:29] first we know if the user has completed
[128:31] his habit today we first gonna check if
[128:37] uh
[128:39] he doesn't have any record
[128:48] okay we're gonna do something it's a bit
[128:49] tricky to read
[128:51] um
[128:52] there is no support that update.record
[128:59] there's no record or sport the radar
[129:01] record the links
[129:07] equal a zero so the user has never
[129:09] tracked any kind of workout for this
[129:12] specific workout
[129:15] or last option the user
[129:19] for this sport to update that records
[129:24] that's
[129:27] that's links
[129:30] minus one
[129:37] so that checks if the last record
[129:43] we're gonna do moment
[129:58] so this is
[130:01] the time at which the user tracked
[130:04] the require its workouts for the last
[130:07] time
[130:09] you're going to make sure that this was
[130:11] before
[130:13] the start of day for user
[130:16] it's like a very complicated emotion
[130:20] um
[130:21] let's see what does it say if there is
[130:24] no error it's already a good step
[130:29] pulse
[130:30] and that's actually right I have it
[130:34] okay
[130:35] then we're going to add the records so
[130:37] Sports
[130:39] update
[130:41] Dot records.push
[130:47] and you just need add
[130:50] movement
[130:52] UTC
[130:55] we add a UTC a record in the zulu time
[130:59] zone of the user so the on the database
[131:02] the users the the every dates are stored
[131:05] as UDC moments and whenever we do a
[131:09] check with the front end we use the user
[131:11] the user time zone to extract that data
[131:14] and turn it into the user current time
[131:18] so now I'm saving it to the database so
[131:19] I have to put it there
[131:22] um
[131:23] so save so save record
[131:28] then we need to update
[131:31] speed or not
[131:37] okay so that part
[131:40] we need to compare how many records the
[131:43] user have tracked this week
[131:46] so start day for user and we're going to
[131:48] do start week
[131:50] tweezer
[131:55] um
[132:01] we need that thing
[132:04] yeah we're gonna get all the
[132:07] boards that the user have been tracking
[132:11] this week
[132:13] are we gonna do something like
[132:15] records
[132:18] this
[132:21] and we're gonna go like this uh
[132:25] reports to update
[132:30] records that's filter
[132:37] into our each record we're gonna do r
[132:40] dot at
[132:45] a moment we're going to turn this
[132:48] add dot time zone user request.user.time
[132:51] Zone
[132:54] and check that this record
[132:57] is superior
[133:01] or equal to
[133:04] start week for user
[133:11] okay
[133:12] so that's normally it's an array that
[133:14] contains all the
[133:16] recourse
[133:18] that I have been tracked this week and
[133:20] that's how we're going to calculate the
[133:22] experience for the user
[133:25] we're gonna go uh moment dot recorded at
[133:28] okay
[133:32] um
[133:55] so
[133:58] I'm gonna go with this and say constants
[134:13] um
[134:31] record this week but
[134:38] is
[134:39] inferior
[134:44] or equal
[134:45] and it's
[134:49] support to update dots
[134:53] gold
[134:56] or zero and here we're going to
[135:00] calculate
[135:05] so if your goal is three
[135:24] in
[135:26] you have already
[135:29] records length
[135:32] equal to
[135:38] simplest to get
[136:22] it's
[136:23] at least three
[136:28] okay
[136:49] here you're going it's
[136:51] um
[137:22] some help
[137:26] um what software are you using
[137:30] uh for if you're asking for the live
[137:33] stuff it's obs
[137:36] this thing here that moves obvious this
[137:39] thing here
[137:42] um
[137:45] yeah that's it that's pretty much it
[137:50] is weak
[138:07] I just get one okay okay I just get one
[138:09] so I get
[138:12] um
[138:13] fast dots
[138:37] nearest integer okay
[138:39] uh the round
[138:43] ER
[138:47] if you have a hundred
[138:49] 100 have experience divided by seven
[138:53] Union
[138:58] okay 100.
[139:01] divided by this
[139:21] what is wrong oh yeah
[139:25] it worked
[139:34] or to update
[139:38] dot XB plus equal XP to gain
[139:44] and then we're going to do sport 2
[139:46] update
[139:48] oh wait sport to update.save
[139:54] and we're gonna return
[140:02] sports or two updates
[140:06] all right let's see how that works
[140:11] um okay
[140:13] all right
[140:16] okay so far so far
[140:19] and bingo reload
[140:24] picking the weightlifting stuff
[140:27] weight lifter oh wow seems like it's
[140:29] worked three times a week
[140:32] yeah that's working three times a week
[140:34] I'm supposed to earn 33 XP per
[140:38] checking the record as being updated
[140:42] um eight
[140:44] uh what time is it okay eight UTC time
[140:48] okay the time is right
[140:52] uh weight lifter Emoji weightlifter okay
[140:55] and now if
[140:59] [Music]
[140:59] um

[143:47] oh you don't get XP okay you add a
[143:49] record but you don't get XP because

[143:59] because I said three times a week okay
[144:02] we're good we're good
[144:06] alrighty next thing we need to fix is
[144:09] this ask completed today

[147:22] if I give you undefined moments you give
[147:25] me back the real time

[151:16] now I need to know how to mutate the
[151:18] data so it reflects
[151:21] three times a week
[151:24] maybe what we can do
[151:26] this thing so
[151:27] index
[151:32] row icon
[151:41] very cute
[152:24] yeah that's a smart break
[152:28] it's so funny it's crazy how chat GPT is
[152:31] taking over Google there's like a I
[152:33] think that it's the new world it is
[152:35] going to be a new world world in the
[152:38] dictionary now it's like Google
[152:39] something and it's going to be Chad gbt
[152:41] that
[152:42] crazy
[152:47] um
[152:51] three times a week
[152:52] how to record three times a week
[153:03] three times a week here we are going to
[153:06] give you your strict your total records
[153:09] let's say
[153:10] xsm and we're gonna do
[153:14] um s dot records.length
[153:20] fire
[153:24] okay the number of workouts
[153:28] you've done
[153:30] bold
[153:34] I've done it one time you've done it
[153:36] eight times congratulations sir
[153:42] um
[153:46] right
[153:48] um
[153:50] in so many times I've done it I can add
[153:52] a record
[154:02] let's just check something if I create a
[154:04] habit where I said I'm gonna do soccer
[154:06] seven times a week
[154:08] normally if I Shrek I should get back
[154:13] oh I need to show my XP of course
[154:18] right maybe we do this
[154:24] is the recorded links
[154:39] we didn't have it
[154:47] a little board
[154:52] oh wow this guy has been doing pretty
[154:54] well
[154:57] but not bad
[155:38] foreign
[155:42] a bit later
[155:44] that's the point so
[155:47] XP
[155:53] um
[155:58] already right
[156:00] and now if I track I'm supposed to get
[156:03] this okay
[156:05] now I need to update the data I need to
[156:08] update that thing with
[156:13] um
[156:20] how does that thing work key data option
[157:15] okay
[157:24] it actually looks like
[157:30] all right we have this little function
[157:32] here
[157:34] so when I'm coming back here
[157:39] um and record
[157:40] s
[157:42] mutate
[157:43] that's the work mutate data and
[157:50] data
[158:09] user
[158:16] I'm gonna keep the same data
[158:20] but we also need
[158:23] to give it a try with this
[158:27] what is actually happening if I press
[158:28] here nothing okay I data and if I do use
[158:36] to a deep nested data
[158:40] um easier to support
[159:06] let's give it a try with something
[159:07] stupid like a test
[159:10] equal
[159:14] and we're going to console log
[159:19] you know
[159:22] we have a user okay
[159:24] I press this
[159:26] we still have a so we have the user and
[159:30] this but then after it's gone
[159:45] that doesn't make sense you're supposed
[159:47] to mutate no
[159:56] the key is not recognizes
[160:00] rebound
[160:08] maybe we do something
[160:16] what would actually happen
[160:28] show me
[160:30] you are
[160:32] oh you are refreshing everything
[160:38] so not the best
[160:42] works
[160:45] below the page
[160:51] is gonna look a bit like 30 somewhere
[160:58] this
[161:39] year of Beats yes let's see Twitter what
[161:42] are you going on
[161:45] oh
[161:46] go Peter
[161:54] sign up
[162:03] some surf I don't want to do it seven
[162:06] times a week
[162:09] I don't know
[162:13] something would be
[162:24] logs
[162:27] oh yeah of course yeah this user doesn't
[162:30] have
[162:30] I have to get out of the app
[162:34] I'm back at the news there
[162:43] save this create a sport surf seven days
[162:46] a week
[162:48] okay
[162:49] so if I add a record
[162:53] okay
[162:55] it doesn't look bad but it doesn't look
[162:58] super good either
[162:59] at least we get something
[163:02] here you gotta say nope
[163:38] right so we need to do something a bit
[163:39] cleaner
[163:40] um
[163:43] because I don't want to refresh the
[163:44] whole front end just for record it
[163:47] should be updated on the back
[163:53] so constant
[163:57] new data
[163:59] this is going to be basically all the
[164:01] data
[164:08] data the user
[164:17] right I need a little bathroom break
[164:19] I'll be back
[176:53] all right
[176:54] we're back
[176:59] so we need to mutate the data here
[177:02] without reloading the whole page
[177:06] I mutate
[177:10] uh
[177:13] new data so we need
[177:36] um
[177:54] we need to update basically requests
[177:57] requests
[177:59] data.user.sports
[178:03] uh whatever X
[178:07] oh
[178:08] press
[178:10] we just need to do this thing
[178:33] new data
[178:36] user
[179:06] app
[179:07] board
[179:21] if
[179:22] um sport.id
[179:26] is
[179:27] [Music]
[179:29] .sport.id
[179:32] you're gonna return
[179:35] rest.sport
[179:37] else we're gonna return
[179:41] Sports
[179:45] uh maybe we can console log the new data
[179:53] and see and do something like mutate
[180:13] um
[180:18] I'm gonna do is this and we're gonna
[180:20] remove on the back end the check so we
[180:23] can do can try it many times add record
[180:28] I'm going to disable this for a second
[180:31] and we're gonna see what is actually
[180:33] going on
[180:35] until that log
[180:44] all right let's see
[180:48] okay we got an update here so we got
[180:50] something
[180:53] user Sports
[180:56] we didn't touch the other sports
[181:00] in the sucker
[181:03] is now
[181:07] wait
[181:11] you're giving me the previous data
[181:15] oh oh yeah okay
[181:28] what is going on here
[181:39] thank you Carlos
[181:45] hey Google
[181:47] play The Blaze
[182:01] and it's a bit strange because you are
[182:03] showing me
[182:09] the right thing
[182:19] that is so weird
[182:28] all right but it's working so
[182:32] here we go
[182:34] um
[182:37] I think there needs to be a little error
[182:39] and Link somewhere in the app to tell
[182:40] the user we're going to use react
[182:42] testify
[182:44] okay
[182:45] one
[182:50] yeah that's the one let's use this thing
[182:54] it's a good library to just display
[182:56] hairs for the user it'll show for me for
[182:59] debugging mostly actually
[183:06] what's this
[183:12] just this
[183:15] CSS
[183:18] and here we go
[183:34] container
[184:01] um should we create a layout
[184:08] layout thanksgs
[184:20] or maybe we can do it on document I
[184:22] don't think they will accept
[184:24] now I suppose structure okay
[184:32] page
[184:34] oh the G is
[184:36] great
[184:37] yep
[184:47] this
[184:51] what are you gonna do
[184:52] this
[185:00] this
[185:02] and then I think we call it in the app
[185:09] I need to write it
[185:24] here
[185:42] very pleased but is going to be here
[185:46] um top right close and click draggable
[185:48] High progress bar nope
[185:50] close true close button
[185:53] yeah limit
[185:57] and here we go
[186:00] which means normally here
[186:02] we're gonna call back this function and
[186:05] go
[186:15] and here we are going to try
[186:29] uh
[186:32] maybe we don't need
[186:35] maybe just call it in the API client
[186:40] if there's an error from the API we are
[186:43] going to
[186:45] lug it
[186:52] if I write
[187:54] oh you were here
[188:02] are not really going where you should
[188:05] we're there
[188:40] don't you like it
[188:58] seems to be the way to go
[189:05] oh maybe I'm calling it the wrong way
[189:09] Maybe
[189:12] here like this
[189:18] okay I'm not happy here
[189:27] we have the layouts
[189:49] oh okay I know
[189:56] because I haven't imported the style
[190:00] yes
[190:16] yep
[190:29] you are extremely fast
[190:36] okay
[190:38] we've already completed your activity
[190:40] perfect and we have some hair end links
[190:43] now
[190:44] and here in the front and side we are
[190:47] going to just do this and wrap it
[190:51] and try
[191:06] you know what all right what is going on
[191:08] here
[191:12] oh there are two okay
[191:14] there's another one here
[191:20] okay
[191:25] here same
[191:27] could you call me pick an emoji okay we
[191:29] have some error in the link in the app
[191:31] nice
[191:32] nice nice
[191:46] here
[191:50] um
[191:53] if I press this
[191:55] and tell me I've already completed
[191:58] if I add a new habit
[192:02] sure
[192:05] but actually
[192:08] I have two
[192:09] sending and record
[192:12] ID
[192:15] okay you're sending the ID okay
[192:20] it's like it's pretty soft now I think
[192:23] it's a matter of
[192:25] um displaying information
[192:29] um
[192:33] we'll need some kind of progress bar
[192:37] to show your current level
[192:40] of Warcraft
[192:46] and level up
[192:48] that sound just level up
[192:51] all right
[192:52] heavy character
[192:55] uh life
[193:01] maybe just pull the record
[193:12] I mean I remember the name of the stuff
[193:14] in French because I used to play in
[193:16] French but I don't know how to call that
[193:18] thing out yet here
[193:20] uh just want to see
[193:22] how to display the level up stuff
[193:25] that was good where is that the racing
[193:27] around nine years after
[193:29] [ __ ] that makes me want to please sing
[193:31] this
[193:33] can be your level eyes might be too
[193:35] complicated to imitate this
[193:39] um
[193:42] what you want to see is
[193:51] if you're exp and you are
[193:57] level
[194:02] here
[194:04] the level will be so we need a helper
[194:07] here
[194:08] um we are going
[194:13] maybe game the game
[194:17] um
[194:18] so the logic
[194:21] in average users can earn about 100
[194:25] speed
[194:27] a week that's the maximum you can earn
[194:33] and pure workout
[194:35] you can earn at minimum if 14 XP or at
[194:40] maximum
[194:42] and really expect in the time
[194:46] that's in the case of you have one time
[194:50] a week
[194:53] and that's in the case you are 7 x a
[194:57] week
[195:03] so everybody starts level one
[195:14] then level two
[195:18] when you have
[195:22] that's a good point uh I think in
[195:24] average people will have
[195:28] three
[195:30] the goal of three conversations a week
[195:33] which means
[195:35] um you in average people will earn 33 XP
[195:38] in a week
[195:40] in a day every time they tick
[195:44] which means
[195:47] I think level 2 could be 10 XP
[195:52] three
[195:55] level three could be 30 EXP
[195:59] level four could be 60.
[196:03] level five could be
[196:07] uh maybe a hundred
[196:13] which means in that case
[196:15] it would check
[196:19] one day at minimum it would take one day
[196:24] or
[196:25] at maximum it would take one day so
[196:28] that's one day max
[196:31] everybody basically everyone who signed
[196:34] up for the game can earn
[196:37] and go level 2 in the first day
[196:40] then to go number three you need 30 XP
[196:44] which means if you only have one habit
[196:50] or maybe we're going to calculate for
[196:51] this guy this guy and this guy okay
[196:57] three eggs a week
[197:20] all right
[197:22] so one day the math are here one day one
[197:27] day one day
[197:30] so if you're tuning in
[197:32] um
[197:32] I'm trying to calculate what is the best
[197:37] how the level up system will work based
[197:39] on the experience point the user is
[197:40] getting
[197:42] uh so I'll do three use cases
[197:45] um there is a threshold of 100 XP that
[197:48] can be earned a week whether whatever
[197:50] your goal is whether it's seven times
[197:52] work out a week or just one time
[197:55] and basically
[197:57] what you earn
[197:59] is you earn when you have a goal of
[198:01] seven times a week you have a go you can
[198:03] earn 14 XP per tick of your habit
[198:07] when you have a goal of three workout a
[198:09] week you can earn 33 XP per kick and
[198:13] when your goal is just one workout a
[198:15] week you hurt you earn 100xp
[198:18] critique
[198:19] and
[198:21] that's have uh I have a habit tracker
[198:24] called habits Garden where people can
[198:27] track their habits and and he turns them
[198:29] into a game
[198:31] um and I found that a very critical part
[198:34] of the app is to make people
[198:38] enjoy the day Zero of the app
[198:41] which means like whatever your goal is
[198:43] whether it's one day a week one times a
[198:45] week or seven times a week
[198:46] you should be able to level up level one
[198:49] or level two at least within a day
[198:52] so if I said 10 x pay it means that the
[198:55] guy who is heavily working out will need
[198:58] one day to get to level two the guy with
[199:01] 3x a week one day in one day now for
[199:04] level three
[199:07] or the first guy
[199:09] he would take uh
[199:11] what's that 14 a day so you can 28 like
[199:14] three days
[199:17] three days
[199:18] uh for the second guy is gonna take
[199:22] one day
[199:24] and for the other guy is gonna get one
[199:27] day as well
[199:32] moving on
[199:34] level four you need 60 60 XP
[199:39] so that means the first guy would
[199:41] actually need five days not mistaken
[199:46] 570. 70 yep that's five leads
[199:50] here okay
[199:52] since
[199:55] um guy number two
[199:58] would need
[200:02] two days
[200:03] three days and guide number three
[200:07] just one day
[200:11] ready right
[200:13] and then to level five
[200:16] I think they're gonna be something like
[200:17] 10 levels
[200:19] um and you're gonna get harder and
[200:20] harder uh for these guys gonna get a
[200:23] week so seven days
[200:25] uh
[200:36] seven days for this guy is going to take
[200:42] 33 33 he's gonna think you say bam
[200:46] stupid of course gonna take you a week
[200:47] for everyone
[200:49] no is that
[200:53] oh no it's gonna take seven
[200:56] no it's getting like three days I'm
[200:57] stupid
[201:02] yeah maybe four days anyway
[201:05] and for the other guy is going to take
[201:07] uh
[201:10] one day [ __ ]
[201:31] and Hell Twitter
[201:42] uh
[202:07] but if I sign up for one day
[202:11] I make so much experience points that I
[202:13] have no reason to show up for the whole
[202:15] week but at the same point
[202:19] my goal is to work out one time a week
[202:21] I'm not supposed to open the app more
[202:23] than one time a week
[202:25] which obviously suck a little bit
[202:27] because they will never come back
[203:14] stuff
[203:16] I'm tired
[203:31] all right level two will be 10xp for
[203:33] sure
[203:41] Maybe
[203:47] remembering this one should be 80.
[203:51] this one
[204:23] two times a week you earn 58 space so
[204:26] you get a cross level one level two okay
[204:28] all right that sounds like about a fair
[204:30] way to do it
[204:34] um
[204:44] five six seven eight
[204:49] five
[204:53] weeks
[204:55] no that's a lot is too much
[204:59] I think my week number two you should be
[205:02] level seven is eight or nine
[205:04] it's harder than the World of Warcraft
[205:21] and
[205:30] plus four so
[205:38] we can change later you can try it's
[205:41] better
[205:44] um how do we declare that
[205:46] we need to know per level
[205:50] is
[205:54] instant levels
[205:57] like
[206:08] um
[206:12] we need to know the XP required
[206:16] for for each level we need
[206:21] required
[206:26] okay
[206:28] you need to know
[206:32] the display number
[206:38] and we need to know
[206:42] third level
[207:12] oh and we need to know how it's gonna
[207:14] scaging
[207:16] how the Emoji looks like so this that's
[207:19] not displayed we need to remember
[207:22] okay
[207:23] you know the
[207:28] uh the CSS basically and we need also
[207:31] some helper functions so if I give you
[207:34] XP
[207:36] or I give you okay
[207:40] you're supposed to give me back my level
[207:44] with all the details
[207:48] and a function where
[207:51] oh I think
[208:23] I can use maps JavaScript but I've never
[208:26] used them before
[208:59] it one
[210:33] yo-yo
[210:36] hey
[210:38] um
[210:40] basically so there will be this is a
[210:42] dashboard you're gonna have you're gonna
[210:43] start level one when you start a workout
[210:46] and for each sport you can add records
[210:49] and every time you add a record you get
[210:50] some you gain some experience points
[210:54] and so you have different kind of levels
[210:55] and for instance level one
[210:57] each level would have uh some sets of
[211:01] data so the XP required
[211:06] let's say a 20
[211:08] um it would have a number to display so
[211:11] level one or just one or just level one
[211:13] something like this
[211:16] and it needs to have some CSS classes to
[211:20] uh
[211:21] modify the Emoji so for the soccer Emoji
[211:25] here if you're level one you're gonna
[211:26] have something like text SM
[211:29] and scale 90 and Saturdays
[211:35] to rate 50 or something
[211:38] and then this is when you're level one
[211:40] and then as you progress as you track
[211:43] you add records for each sport you're
[211:46] gonna level up and say you're gonna
[211:47] become level two at some point which
[211:49] required let's say like 50 XP display
[211:51] like level two text uh vase or takes MD
[211:57] skill December so and the statutory 800
[212:00] and then they're going to be like about
[212:02] 10 levels I think it will be 10 levels
[212:04] actually
[212:05] and I just need to know
[212:07] um whether I should make a map or just
[212:10] something a
[212:11] try to kick it with track
[212:16] so how I the the the thing is at some
[212:19] point I will need to give this thing the
[212:22] number of XP the player has
[212:24] and then that object will reply with the
[212:29] XP required it will reply with the
[212:31] current level by checking the XP
[212:34] required
[212:36] that's my only uh struggle with this
[212:44] [Music]
[212:47] the CTO here is
[212:49] so
[212:52] because there's a
[212:59] okay
[213:00] so do something like I will check the
[213:02] keys
[213:06] and I'll take the first one
[213:14] do you think would you do a map bro or
[213:17] would you just do a typical JavaScript
[213:18] object
[213:23] okay
[213:28] probably mapa
[213:36] you're the king
[213:42] I wish I could invite you on the
[213:45] oh man I wish we would be able to start
[213:47] up together that would be so fun
[213:53] I think I changed the YouTube latency
[213:55] and it looks like uh we can have some
[213:58] kind of conversation because yesterday I
[213:59] had like a medium latency
[214:01] I would ask a question and then the
[214:03] person would reply like one minute after
[214:06] looks like it at least we're a bit
[214:08] connected now
[214:10] you cannot send links by the way to on
[214:13] the chats you I you would have to DM me
[214:15] on Twitter
[214:57] and then
[215:05] level one
[215:21] okay bro thank you
[215:33] I'm gonna play around with this then
[215:36] um
[215:40] hey Google
[215:41] turn on the bedroom lights
[215:46] hey Google
[215:47] bedroom light brightness to 100 percent
[215:52] I go
[216:06] maybe three
[216:11] maybe it's third as three Excel set your
[216:14] rate
[216:25] twice bowling
[216:39] maybe we started like this
[216:58] yeah totally
[217:05] century
[217:08] or maybe he would start
[217:16] that could be and then
[217:19] you know
[217:28] all right that makes a big difference
[217:45] that's too much
[217:51] a little bit tricky
[218:03] no okay
[218:13] Okay so
[218:17] okay
[218:22] that become massive
[218:25] six Excel
[218:28] seven
[218:34] strange what is
[218:38] okay
[218:46] getting a massive emojis
[219:36] hey
[219:44] Ah that's good okay
[219:51] that's cute
[219:59] right okay
[220:01] I think we got something
[220:13] let's say we go from
[220:17] three two
[220:19] three point five
[220:23] or eight
[220:26] and then four one
[220:30] point
[220:35] hey we got something
[220:39] okay
[220:49] all righty ready I'm gonna do something
[220:51] really boring
[220:53] is delete my accounts because the App
[220:56] Store will require it
[220:59] we're going to create a route in oath
[221:01] and we're going to say delete
[221:15] oh maybe we don't even create maybe
[221:17] we'll just go to user
[221:19] and we're gonna have let's get
[221:23] um
[221:24] safe
[221:28] I'll see if
[221:32] that method
[221:37] delete
[221:42] and we are going to delete the user
[221:45] you're not authentified

[222:44] uh
[222:45] we're gonna have a setting page
[222:46] somewhere in the app
[222:51] I don't know why we would have a city
[222:53] page but we can
[222:59] in the settings and we are going to do
[223:01] something
[223:04] uh we don't need to fetch the user
[223:17] login
[223:26] might need a back button yeah we do need
[223:28] a back button
[223:31] and eight
[223:39] maybe we're going to create a little
[223:40] component for
[223:49] and we are going to create
[223:52] but then
[223:58] that button will actually be this little
[224:01] thing here
[224:03] link
[224:11] href
[224:19] by default

[226:41] login sign up
[226:47] this is pretty boring but I have to do
[226:49] it
[226:50] uh because otherwise the app stores will
[226:53] deliver except my account if users
[226:55] cannot delete some accounts
[226:59] seconds
[227:04] um and so normally in my index page
[227:28] settings
[227:36] hey Google dinner time
[227:50] router push and delete accounts
[227:53] here we're gonna have a
[227:58] good things
[228:03] and I delete my accounts I always are
[228:05] sure
[228:07] yes I am sure
[228:14] currency nuts
[228:16] API resolved without sending a
[228:22] all right I think I'm gonna do that
[228:23] after you take new data yeah [ __ ] it for
[228:27] you
[228:37] uh
[228:44] uh you know what I'm gonna check what
[228:46] said okay
[228:50] oh maybe what happened Guillaume is that
[228:52] because you sent a link
[228:54] uh Twitter considered it as a Spam or
[228:57] something
[228:59] what is going on
[229:01] growth in turn
[229:08] give me a second yeah
[229:11] funny because you put crappy in here it
[229:13] says like
[229:24] a link you cannot send link on YouTube
[229:27] and Twitter link is or nuked right away
[229:30] so uh
[229:33] confirm each other that you're going to
[229:36] send me a link and then maybe they will
[229:38] allow us to send links
[229:40] crazy if you're gonna do it there's uh
[229:42] maybe I'll just message you maybe it'll
[229:43] be simpler maybe if I message you
[229:45] actually
[229:50] maybe they will unlock the stuff no
[229:55] I'll actually message you in the past
[229:56] that's so weird
[230:22] maybe I didn't delete
[230:25] settings
[230:27] API client.delete
[230:40] what did you send buddy
[230:44] now
[230:50] API user
[230:52] what are you sending
[230:55] depending
[231:14] who are you
[231:21] hello wife
[231:25] what was it
[231:30] yeah I believe all right probably
[231:34] yeah
[231:35] you're actually here
[231:40] wow
[231:44] again I think nobody can see
[231:47] here
[231:57] I think you've you've been busted
[232:02] I'm pretty sure look at Luca senior
[232:06] pretty sure Lucas saw you
[232:10] he's been here for a little while and he
[232:12] just said hello
[232:14] I I don't it's towards me
[232:19] we'll do this first
[232:26] two-headed AI generation we never know
[232:28] his Twitter what's going on these days
[232:29] was AI
[232:32] hello
[232:35] she's
[232:43] oh thank you I'm sorry for that it's
[232:45] terrible
[232:47] just
[233:06] hello you
[233:10] my happy agent
[233:22] oh wow the man
[233:25] shooter bro
[233:27] oh okay yes
[233:31] okay you're perfect
[233:33] well I think you're in you're an expert
[233:39] oh [ __ ] you're the man wait
[233:41] let's go
[233:45] game
[233:46] boom uh Express required levels
[233:51] okay
[233:53] export
[233:56] levels
[234:02] we're putting games bro so fun
[234:04] settings
[234:08] um that's the one
[234:12] okay that's the one
[234:21] uh so we're supposed to be here
[234:24] although
[234:30] it turns level as does XP you ready one
[234:33] two three
[234:35] would have been too simple I think I
[234:38] made a terrible mistake somewhere
[234:46] I think I made a mistake
[234:48] oh okay
[234:52] um
[234:53] uh
[235:00] scheme
[235:02] level level okay for now we don't have
[235:05] it oh yeah okay okay because that's not
[235:07] that's the level
[235:08] turn uh level
[235:12] current level that level
[235:15] you are here
[235:22] yes no okay
[235:36] oh okay okay
[235:58] so that's me making a terrible mistake I
[236:01] know you actually returned the level no
[236:03] actually and stupid yeah you did it oh I
[236:06] think I will need
[236:07] reaching current level
[236:13] break
[236:17] oh okay I see what you're doing
[236:20] so you uh forget current level
[236:23] here and we're going to the levels
[236:26] dot get current level
[236:29] almost uh in the format okay that's a
[236:32] little
[236:37] there we go bingo
[236:39] you're the man
[236:43] yep
[236:45] second name
[236:50] yeah the main game
[236:52] I think it's it's exactly what's I mean
[236:56] I think I can go on with this
[237:00] every stuff
[237:02] uh
[237:04] level one let's say level one I think we
[237:06] said it's gonna be 10x pair level 2 is
[237:08] going to be 40 XP
[237:10] um this one's gonna be 80 EXP
[237:15] yeah of course you don't have any level
[237:17] uh this one will be
[237:20] or
[237:25] and you're going to have 150 XP all
[237:28] right so now we're going to do the fun
[237:29] part
[237:31] no no level four not six plus two
[237:37] level three
[237:40] I'm gonna check what you got
[237:45] yeah I mean yeah let's do it live I
[237:47] think it can be fun man like a like a
[237:49] proper
[237:51] startup launching stuff that could be
[237:52] really really fun thank you so much my
[237:54] bro thanks for your time
[238:07] here bro
[238:09] have a good one
[238:37] oh yep yep yep yep
[238:50] oh yep the current level
[238:53] and then here my mistake is I am
[238:57] supposed to
[238:59] minus one
[239:01] here we go
[239:04] at the current level
[239:11] as I use an error stuff okay
[239:16] all right if you're tuning in um we are
[239:19] building a little startup
[239:21] where you pick your workout Avatar
[239:25] a little bit working so you wanted to do
[239:26] golfing and you want to do it two times
[239:28] a week
[239:30] and then you have your avatars that
[239:31] means being created here and every day
[239:33] you can show up and add a record if
[239:35] you've done your golfing
[239:37] then your avatar will get more colorful
[239:39] and bigger as you reach your goals you
[239:42] have some experience points
[239:44] and there will be uh some kind of like a
[239:46] leaderboard where you can see other
[239:48] people who are golfing which levels they
[239:50] are and how many uh times they've been
[239:52] dolphin
[239:53] pretty much it is a seven day challenge
[239:55] uh it's day number two I spent another
[239:58] day already with the authentication
[240:00] because I was stuck with something
[240:01] there's pretty much the idea that all
[240:04] these two ship the startup on product
[240:06] turned at the end of those seven days
[240:09] uh and it's gonna be also a mobile app
[240:12] uh let me let me show you guys actually
[240:15] it's quite fun I'm using a technology
[240:16] called capacitor
[240:19] no it's uh so now I'm just running a
[240:22] quick comment it's building all my files
[240:26] and then if I go to my xcode projects
[240:29] and I just run it
[240:31] I'm supposed to have the app working on
[240:33] the phone and I can ship this to the
[240:35] stores
[240:37] and there you go you have my account I
[240:39] can create Sports I can surf
[240:41] seven times a week
[240:43] it creates uh something went wrong
[240:46] probably because it's connected to the
[240:49] live API
[240:51] that's interesting
[240:52] uh what would it be
[240:58] reversal
[241:01] see the logs
[241:07] okay um
[241:09] at Vig a I think I could be streaming on
[241:12] Twitch I just don't know the platform
[241:14] um if you think it's it's worth it do
[241:16] you think it's a good to
[241:19] I don't know I'm trying to understand
[241:20] different with YouTube
[241:22] and um and eventually get there
[241:37] um
[241:45] is the
[241:47] run up to the smaller integer
[241:50] greater than okay
[241:53] line ticker uh
[242:17] python okay
[242:52] uh and we're just gonna show that
[243:00] show me
[243:03] and that
[243:04] oh yeah
[243:18] you have to return it yep
[243:21] wait here four four two four two you are
[243:25] a genius y let me try to process the
[243:27] thing
[243:32] you give me XP
[243:34] what bro you have to explain me what is
[243:38] this kind of magic
[243:43] what is going on
[244:05] you have to do this
[244:13] all right you gotta explain me I don't
[244:15] get it
[244:16] I feel like I'm like in high school when
[244:18] a teacher was explaining some math stuff
[244:20] and I was like
[244:22] you give me explain and you return
[244:25] smallest integer
[244:27] greater
[244:58] oh but I think in your case if I'm not
[245:00] mistaken in your case
[245:02] the every level would need 39 XP to go
[245:09] the the level ahead right
[245:17] basically what I'm
[245:19] saying is that level one level two
[245:23] you need 39 XP
[245:27] level three
[245:34] you need 78 XP
[245:40] number four
[245:44] you need one uh 121
[245:48] on something seven expert
[246:01] oh okay okay oh okay
[246:05] yeah because so actually yeah it's a
[246:08] good point I think that would work just
[246:10] the game is going to be easy at first
[246:12] and then it's going to get harder and
[246:14] harder and harder so when you're gonna
[246:16] go level 10 for instance
[246:18] you're gonna need something like this
[246:20] much
[246:21] XP
[246:23] so it's not linear it's like some kind
[246:27] of exponential growth I mean we could
[246:28] have an exponential function which makes
[246:30] a lot of sense but I think it's a very
[246:32] simple game
[246:35] and I'm not going to go crazy like uh
[246:37] with some complex logic behind it so I
[246:39] think I will just stick with that pen
[246:42] mapping stuff for at least for this for
[246:45] this demo
[246:46] but it was it's it's uh it's pretty
[246:48] smart like uh
[246:50] I think it's a smarter way to do it
[246:54] um there we go
[247:04] no I think it's not over I think it's a
[247:06] smart way to do it but it would be
[247:09] would be good if you know I I like it's
[247:12] a game that has been working for a
[247:13] little while and I'm trying to automate
[247:15] a few stuff
[247:16] to make things a bit simpler but in this
[247:19] case where I don't even know whether
[247:20] there will be users on this app I think
[247:23] I'll go with the just a super fast way
[247:25] of doing it and ship it
[247:28] yeah yeah exactly yeah
[247:35] right so we hear we have the levels
[247:38] um wait I need to finish that delete
[247:40] function somewhere there
[247:42] uh which is not
[247:45] being
[247:46] understood by the back end so
[247:49] show me
[247:50] request methodical quit
[247:54] okay
[247:56] super
[247:57] request method and then normally here
[248:01] to delete my account forever
[248:05] something went wrong
[248:08] what went wrong tell me tell me tell me
[248:15] user is not defined yes of course user
[248:17] isn't defined its request user
[248:23] so I haven't removed the user okay
[248:26] Elite bye bye user
[248:34] still not
[248:36] requesting user to remove is not a
[248:38] function I didn't have this Garden
[248:40] um settings
[248:42] delete delete user
[248:45] a user that service delete
[248:49] this is exactly what I'm doing here
[248:51] easier to remove
[248:54] request a user to remove
[249:01] paper request a user to remove ease node
[249:03] of function
[249:05] it is not a function
[249:07] you can
[249:09] relate to the sports but you can update
[249:11] so that log the use user
[249:19] you're supposed to be a mongoose object
[249:22] no
[249:41] okay
[249:44] all right advic thank you for tuning in
[249:49] [Music]
[249:49] um
[249:51] delete
[249:53] get the chicken
[249:56] congratulations
[250:01] and delete you
[250:13] yeah I mean I can do that but I just
[250:15] want to delete you

[254:55] now you delete the user what is going on
[254:58] come on bro you cannot play like this
[255:00] with me
[255:00] what

[255:10] then yep all right
[255:14] okay we're good
[255:17] oh hello user
[255:26] create Sports workouts
[255:29] okay
[255:33] now we need to play a bit with the game
[255:36] um
[255:37] let's try something if
[255:43] last names maybe will be fixed
[255:49] no
[255:52] oh I just
[256:05] contents
[256:23] components and at the same
[256:26] so we have
[256:29] Pages helpers
[256:34] helpers
[256:38] beat
[256:45] nope
[256:48] I've heard
[256:57] um
[256:58] level one experience required actually
[257:01] zero
[257:06] uh level three experience required and
[257:10] level three
[257:30] level and then in my index
[257:35] return level
[257:41] are you talking about
[257:46] I'm not level two
[257:48] how much expert you have zero
[257:58] oh okay let's current level
[258:11] in Superior
[258:13] experience card
[258:22] um
[258:26] oh
[258:29] oh I see what you did you
[258:38] oh okay so it displays level two level
[258:40] three okay
[258:57] so that's gonna be called level two
[259:00] three
[259:03] however they still need level one
[259:09] I need to modify your function give you
[259:13] um
[259:27] zero
[259:29] and
[259:31] three
[259:32] four
[259:43] right
[259:46] current level level one if e e I'm gonna
[259:49] go through all the levels
[259:53] some user
[259:54] Superior
[260:18] yeah okay
[260:22] little one and we're gonna call this
[260:24] class
[260:26] names
[260:28] last name
[260:32] um texts
[260:37] that works
[260:40] here we are good
[260:47] emoji
[260:49] here we go
[260:57] set your rates that array
[261:26] it's working
[261:29] um we're gonna start maybe three Excel
[261:32] where is three
[261:37] uh you won't give me this okay
[261:39] better
[261:40] three REM let's see how big that is
[261:45] okay and if we so if we increase this
[261:50] by
[261:51] 0.3 every level for 10 levels
[261:55] we're gonna end up at Maximum 6 RDM
[261:57] which is quite big but quite nice
[262:02] if I start at three
[262:04] and then I level up and I become 3.3
[262:10] okay
[262:12] so maybe we do this
[262:20] like this 3.3
[262:24] six
[262:34] seven
[262:38] three
[262:40] nine
[262:42] eight
[262:45] and let's go with level five okay 4.2
[262:51] zero nine
[262:54] so
[262:56] you ready
[262:58] I'm gonna give it a test so I just
[262:59] created a new sports
[263:01] I'm going to add a record knowing that I
[263:04] want to work out three times a week I'm
[263:06] supposed to get something like 30
[263:08] experience points which is going to
[263:10] shook me to level two right away
[263:13] let's try
[263:17] it works
[263:18] I'm level two wow
[263:25] in a new record of course and now if I
[263:27] create a new workout Emoji a golfer
[263:31] about one times a week
[263:33] this one yeah it's supposed to be
[263:35] smaller less colorful
[263:39] oh maybe we can even do something like
[263:40] this
[263:41] three and
[263:43] I
[263:44] seven eight okay and so at the beginning
[263:47] there's a big big difference
[263:52] and maybe we're gonna go crazy we even
[263:54] gonna see that
[263:57] all right now I'll need some kind of a
[263:59] proper display for those
[264:04] being like this uh
[264:13] yep
[264:16] no no no no no thanks
[264:23] we're gonna say that this is margin
[264:28] [Music]
[264:32] so
[264:34] like fun
[264:36] all right I'm gonna add a workout this
[264:38] one will shoot me through level uh I'm
[264:40] supposed to get normally 100 experience
[264:42] so I'm going to go directly to level
[264:45] or
[264:48] bingo
[264:51] wow
[264:54] all right that's a lot at the very
[264:56] beginning but I think it's important uh
[264:59] because I mean yeah
[265:02] I think this should be right
[265:07] 3.9
[265:10] quite fun
[265:16] all right I'm going to push this to
[265:17] Broad uh
[265:19] e-mold
[265:24] check up on Twitter if you guys are so
[265:26] rare
[265:35] how many
[266:17] maybe those
[266:23] surf seven times a week
[266:26] it's quite big
[266:29] already quite big
[266:36] okay
[267:06] yes that's a successful emoji
[267:11] um like a problem is I
[267:17] think
[267:22] it's turn it's 2.5
[267:24] then we go directly to three
[267:29] and we go on
[267:36] and we are good
[268:26] uh we still don't see much difference
[268:28] between the levels
[268:31] you need to increase that
[269:05] we can decide the design way later
[270:41] okay think I'm gonna have a little break
[270:44] for food
[270:50] yep I'll see you
[270:53] I'll see you very soon
[271:22] right here having a break of food I'll
[271:24] see you in a few minutes
[353:02] hey hello we're back
[353:05] a little hour of coding before sleep
[353:09] all right well yeah it's so
[353:14] um
[353:16] putting that thing okay
[353:18] all right so we can add records
[353:21] we can delete our accounts we can log
[353:23] out
[353:25] that's pretty functional I think we need
[353:29] the
[353:30] leaderboards like
[353:34] we need a route that's going to show uh
[353:37] people with similar activities
[353:43] you have a workout is it going to have
[353:45] you're going to have your own workouts
[353:46] at the top
[353:48] probably we can make a single page app
[353:50] we don't need to go crazy with this
[353:55] maybe that means we're gonna create uh
[353:59] API
[354:00] bullets
[354:02] users
[354:05] I'm gonna create some
[354:11] maybe we can even make that route public
[354:15] that we could display the leaderboards
[354:17] on the landing page that would be great
[354:21] okay
[354:24] so we don't need we need course we need
[354:27] database but we don't need the
[354:28] Authentication
[354:31] um
[354:32] [Music]
[354:34] like that
[354:36] are we gonna do some magic uh are we
[354:39] going to send
[354:41] this
[354:42] all right back for now it doesn't exist
[354:48] okay
[354:49] so we're gonna import
[354:55] user model
[354:59] and we are going to do check take all
[355:05] like all the users
[355:08] user dot find
[355:13] wait we want their usernames what do we
[355:16] want we want to show a leaderboard so we
[355:17] need to know how much xp they have
[355:22] we're going to put them into different
[355:23] levels
[355:25] we need to know how many records they
[355:26] have so we need
[355:28] okay so maybe we don't need the user
[355:29] like that way maybe we just need
[355:32] Sports
[355:34] from Sports we're gonna pull all the
[355:37] sport
[355:43] do we say like users and with this place
[355:45] board or do we all use
[355:51] anyway
[356:08] now we can just pull the user do the
[356:10] work user to find
[356:13] um
[356:14] three chords I don't know what's this oh
[356:18] no
[356:20] all right now we're gonna pull the
[356:21] sports it's gonna be easier so I'm gonna
[356:23] have more
[356:25] um
[356:25] filter a few stuff
[356:35] uh we're gonna check sport that have
[356:37] least uh
[356:40] at least one record otherwise there's no
[356:42] point
[356:45] um
[356:47] I think we do this
[356:52] alerts
[356:58] with the weird comments but
[357:00] do this is true
[357:03] think
[357:09] this okay
[357:12] true
[357:21] and uh XB of course
[357:25] temperature than
[357:27] your
[357:30] which is pretty much the same but
[357:35] you know
[357:41] um okay
[357:46] check
[357:47] [Music]
[357:49] yeah then we're gonna put them in
[357:50] categories for emoji ID
[357:56] [Music]
[358:00] we can maybe select a few stuff like
[358:04] uh
[358:05] the user emojid ID
[358:08] and XP
[358:11] user
[358:22] okay
[358:29] [Music]
[358:35] we're gonna send him back
[358:43] um then we're gonna populate
[358:47] at
[358:50] best path we're going to populate the
[358:52] user path
[358:54] you're going to select
[358:56] only the username which we don't get
[359:00] just the way display the username
[359:05] okay so and the user model we need to
[359:07] add
[359:09] okay he's already there
[359:12] maybe a chick we can have it skirt in
[359:17] or the username and we have some kind of
[359:19] control uh
[359:21] lowercase I'm going to put everything
[359:23] lowercase
[359:26] so we can still
[359:28] dream of course
[359:31] we would call it index as well finally
[359:33] there we go
[359:34] we are crazy and unique and then we just
[359:37] copy past the thing
[359:41] uh
[359:44] I don't care about this you can have
[359:45] whatever username you want
[359:49] these values
[359:52] okay
[359:57] so we have the sports we populate the
[360:00] user but username
[360:04] um what else do we want
[360:07] maybe we lean the that thing
[360:19] um we won't
[360:28] use
[361:12] data as data I used
[361:16] here
[361:22] loading
[361:25] user
[361:30] users we're gonna do a get
[361:34] and we're not going to do
[361:39] because of our rights then
[361:47] uh I think we're gonna need a render
[361:49] function
[361:55] I just create confidence for that
[361:59] it's gonna be missing otherwise
[362:04] render leaderboards
[362:11] we're gonna put this somewhere
[362:15] this for now
[362:33] oh yeah okay I know
[362:37] okay
[362:40] nice
[362:56] um
[363:03] he's got my sir better is an expo
[363:06] I don't know I haven't tried X4 but I
[363:08] think those are two different things
[363:09] because Expo is meant to work with the
[363:11] react native
[363:12] and capacitor is its own react native if
[363:16] I may
[363:20] I think these are very different uh
[363:22] things
[363:23] I think it's like comparing capacitor in
[363:25] react native
[363:41] is loading
[363:45] you're using
[363:49] users else
[363:52] data
[363:54] with the map
[363:56] uh oh no we need to do some kind of
[364:02] uh to be dirty
[364:29] map
[364:31] um so for each sport
[364:39] maybe we're gonna do this after we'll
[364:41] need to think of it
[364:45] hey
[364:46] we're gonna console.log
[364:53] beta user
[364:57] of course okay we have the sports back
[364:59] nice
[365:01] user user user weights are we populating
[365:04] the user that user was deleted
[365:08] populate
[365:10] that either select user okay
[365:15] we have the records
[365:21] we have the experience we have the user
[365:23] with a fine D which is good
[365:27] um
[365:32] okay it's pretty cool
[365:34] we have something already
[365:38] we have a list of sports
[365:43] um
[365:45] we want to display those based on their
[365:49] categories
[365:51] I think we're gonna need to import
[365:54] s
[365:57] the list or the list
[366:06] all right I think we're going to do
[366:07] something like oh no maybe as a user you
[366:09] want to see the sports you're doing
[366:10] first
[366:12] wait this little board
[366:15] is going to show you
[366:17] for each sport who are
[366:20] one sport and then different levels
[366:24] or yes or
[366:27] yeah
[366:29] I think
[366:40] um
[366:43] support Sports
[366:46] level one
[366:48] level two
[366:51] oh
[366:54] and then on and on and on and for each
[366:57] level
[366:58] is going to show
[367:00] most XP
[367:06] user with the most EXP
[367:18] alright we need something like this
[367:20] board and I just want to see the sports
[367:23] I'm doing
[367:25] first because I don't wanna
[367:27] go over little boards where I don't care
[367:32] or maybe I just display
[367:35] maybe I just displayed for now the
[367:37] sports
[367:45] that would make sense I'll just display
[367:54] I'll just display the sport I'm
[367:55] interested in
[367:57] I don't care for runners for instance if
[368:00] I'm doing cycling I'm just going to see
[368:02] the leaderboard for the cyclists
[368:04] and then level and then
[368:36] maybe I want to see it inside of each
[368:38] card
[368:40] maybe that's my Sport and I want to see
[368:43] with each of those
[368:55] awesome maybe we could have something
[368:57] like this
[369:07] sport
[369:11] emoji
[369:14] maybe I can do something like this I can
[369:15] do like emojid
[369:21] uh
[369:27] body no there was nobody in here
[369:36] we put a buddy into a get request no I
[369:39] don't think
[369:52] terrible question
[370:08] when you go
[370:11] uh why I have not made a bike and
[370:15] separated from the front end because uh
[370:17] well I just use nexus.js
[370:19] and um and they have these API stuff
[370:23] feature where I can just put my routes
[370:26] directly in there and it's so easy to
[370:28] set up a new route
[370:30] um that's the text like I've been using
[370:31] for a while as well so it's easier to
[370:33] shift features and the goal is to ship
[370:35] the app in seven days so I need some
[370:38] kind of a check that I already know
[370:44] um
[370:48] be the best way to do this uh
[370:55] they need to pass an array
[370:59] of like something like this
[371:05] test
[371:08] I need to pass on an array as a
[371:14] query parameter okay so there could be
[371:16] something like
[371:17] whatever users and sports IDs
[371:22] equal
[371:24] and then how do I pass an array that's
[371:26] the thing
[371:29] send
[371:50] okay
[372:25] oh interesting
[372:29] okay
[372:30] so
[372:37] yep so
[372:39] what happened and multiple value to the
[372:41] same case it would have something like
[372:45] something
[373:12] all right man how would you which a
[373:14] would you know the API name I should
[373:15] look for
[373:28] oh it's anchoring URL something
[373:37] god dammit yeah the YouTube chat maybe
[373:40] that's a parameter I can change
[373:43] I don't think
[373:45] oh
[373:48] okay bro thanks and have a look
[373:59] oh that's what you talked about append
[374:05] hey
[374:07] thanks buddy
[374:33] oh no but that's not gonna work because
[374:35] I don't know the user
[374:39] oh yeah it's not gonna work
[374:41] because I wanted to fetch only
[374:44] the sports the user has
[374:47] so the back end returns I don't overwork
[374:50] them again it just returns uh the other
[374:53] people that have the same Sports
[374:56] I'm doing the same request at the same
[374:59] time that I'm acquiring the user data
[375:00] I'm also querying that data about other
[375:03] users so I cannot change here and may
[375:06] add parameters about the users because I
[375:08] don't have it yet
[375:10] um I think I'm just gonna move on and
[375:14] I'm not going to try to optimize
[375:16] anything here okay
[375:17] anyway thanks bro it's so nice of you
[375:24] alrighty right so ding
[375:27] and here
[375:29] we're gonna display that thing
[375:32] um
[375:39] you can have your characters you're
[375:41] going to have your level you're going to
[375:42] be able to add a record
[375:45] and then you want to see the leaderboard
[375:49] of people who are at the same level as
[375:52] you
[375:56] so maybe render leaderboard maybe we're
[375:59] gonna do this
[376:04] render leaderboard
[376:06] with a sport idea
[376:10] and this thing here
[376:13] we call the render leaderboard
[376:17] will actually be
[376:23] in there
[376:26] and I'm gonna give it a sport dot uh
[376:33] um
[376:34] we get data from
[376:36] Port Emoji ID
[376:45] okay
[376:47] we're gonna do that in here
[376:58] I get my sport ID
[377:05] and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
[377:07] filter
[377:10] I'm gonna return
[377:12] I'm gonna do
[377:15] uh data use
[377:18] that's filter
[377:21] for each user
[377:25] Chooser I'm gonna do you I mean it's not
[377:28] a user it's actually for each sport
[377:31] I'm gonna do
[377:37] or Dot
[377:40] uh
[377:57] equal support ID
[378:00] and then I'm gonna map their array
[378:12] I'll have an area of support and for now
[378:14] we're just going to do something simple
[378:15] which is going to display everything
[378:19] or Dot
[378:28] don't return the idea
[378:31] effect pretty
[378:34] I think by default
[378:37] word
[378:39] is it gonna work
[378:43] data user
[378:45] oh yeah data users of sports
[378:51] right
[378:54] this is actually the right so this is
[378:57] well filtered
[378:59] uh now we don't care about the Emoji ID
[379:01] what we want to see is we want to see
[379:04] uh
[379:08] we want to see the user username
[379:20] but we're going to see yeah we want to
[379:22] we want to see the user name and the
[379:24] number of experience that person has
[379:27] also we need a sort
[380:07] yeah
[380:08] I'm gonna do this
[380:13] a b
[380:19] B minus a I don't know oh no B dot x v
[380:23] minus a DOT
[380:29] oh yeah
[380:34] all right
[380:48] the person has this much equity
[380:57] um
[381:13] a bit ugly but
[381:16] working
[381:22] maybe we want to filter on the users
[381:24] that have a username otherwise
[381:27] but
[381:28] nice to just see experience points
[381:33] it has to feel real
[381:39] hey Dave
[381:43] to
[381:47] all right
[381:49] weird
[381:51] I want to
[381:53] records
[382:00] select username
[382:10] it's ugly but
[382:13] Sports
[382:15] vehicle Sports brawl
[382:20] filter
[382:22] each sport own sport.user
[382:25] [Music]
[382:26] laser dot username
[382:30] to exists
[382:33] you're not gonna like it because they're
[382:35] yep something went wrong
[382:38] it's important support username
[382:42] let me try this way
[382:44] okay because no one has a username but
[382:46] at least we get something okay
[382:51] so that means we need a route we need an
[382:55] API routes
[382:56] for users to create a username
[383:04] uh what we're gonna do is we are going
[383:07] to
[383:08] move with dedicated if you're not okay
[383:13] um
[383:14] I'll see
[383:16] if requested buddy
[383:19] dot
[383:20] um username does not exist
[383:24] I'm gonna tell you politely
[383:31] you're not supposed to be here
[383:41] if you don't have a username you're
[383:44] gonna receive that thing
[383:48] uh
[383:49] what's your username
[383:56] so there's a username and your thing apk
[383:58] so a user the username equal
[384:02] um
[384:03] Quest the Buddy requests the user the
[384:07] username you call requested buddy that's
[384:09] username
[384:11] and to finish await
[384:14] user let's save
[384:16] and we are going to send back username
[384:22] as the
[384:26] request on vanilla user
[384:31] okay we can create a username which
[384:34] means
[384:48] is the easiest way
[384:51] oh we'll have to create a page
[384:54] create username
[385:00] we're gonna copy past the name
[385:03] uh there are many things we don't need
[385:05] in here
[385:07] create a sport we don't care as well
[385:11] um
[385:13] here we just need username
[385:22] Dingo and they'll create sport
[385:27] end up in the API under the user
[385:32] create username
[385:35] username
[385:38] okay
[385:44] choose create
[385:47] username
[385:48] to compete
[385:52] words
[385:55] and here we just need an input
[385:59] and we can reuse which we use for the
[386:01] sign up
[386:04] or bingo

[386:16] maybe we use that
[386:22] type submit which is like that

[397:06] have plenty
[397:15] I mean okay this is ugly let's go
[397:18] um
[397:20] well I think it's functional we get the
[397:23] little boards you know it's a matter of
[397:25] displaying things
[397:27] because that looks like a very
[397:28] complicated app right now
[397:33] um
[397:35] but anyway
[397:36] done or basic stuff
[397:40] it's functional and tomorrow we are
[397:43] going to
[397:47] see
[397:52] oh wow hello guys
[397:57] okay
[398:03] yo look how you get all the errors
[398:04] before me it's nice you should read the
[398:06] chat more often yo Leonard yo Juan guys
[398:09] it's getting late for me in my time zone
[398:11] it's about nine something
[398:13] um
[398:14] the app is
[398:16] done in terms of a functionality
[398:20] so it's usable like you can create a
[398:22] username you can uh create your workouts
[398:24] sending it on the chat if you guys want
[398:26] to try
[398:28] um
[398:28] tomorrow is going to be for
[398:32] um making this app looks good because
[398:33] now it looks terrible
[398:36] but uh but the logic is there so
[398:38] tomorrow we're gonna make the app look
[398:40] beautiful and then if we're done by
[398:42] tomorrow uh we're gonna move on to the
[398:44] landing page uh and then on and on until
[398:46] we launch on product hunts I think the
[398:49] last day would be making a video a
[398:52] product video that is hopefully fun

[399:09] kind of fun uh
[399:11] some fun uh
[399:13] stuff to do with the rock so
