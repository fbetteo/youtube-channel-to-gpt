[01:19] all right if you are somewhere here in
[01:22] the chat
[01:24] um please let me know so I just know
[01:25] everything is working fine
[01:28] where is it I have to give you a reason
[01:30] okay
[01:35] all right it looks like we're live
[01:36] anyway
[01:40] um
[01:43] something like this
[01:53] oh right all right all right
[01:58] I think we're okay okay sorry if it's
[02:00] taking a little while
[02:02] um
[02:04] you're having issues no okay you're not
[02:06] having any issues okay uh well okay
[02:09] that's gonna be a quick wrap up
[02:11] um making sure
[02:13] green right you can see the screen where
[02:16] all right
[02:18] okay so that's uh pretty much the end
[02:22] um for some reason
[02:23] um
[02:24] the live streaming ended two hours
[02:26] earlier as I expected today uh I don't
[02:28] know what happened maybe my internet
[02:30] crash and YouTube stopped it
[02:32] um so in the meantime I moved forward
[02:35] and I finished the video with the rock
[02:37] that's a marketing video
[02:40] um so yeah there we go so as a quick
[02:42] summary uh we've been building a startup
[02:45] in seven days we started uh exactly
[02:48] seven days ago uh on Twitter on the live
[02:51] um I gave you guys three IDs you guys
[02:53] picked up the ideas you liked the most
[02:55] and we just started building it just
[02:58] from there we we started to ideate some
[03:01] stuff and build an app and everything on
[03:05] you hit what it rain man it was really
[03:07] fun um I'm really think this is for you
[03:09] guys joining you made my days uh
[03:11] brighter it was really fun I was super
[03:13] motivated to work
[03:16] um so yeah I'm very thankful for that uh
[03:18] now where we are we have a landing page
[03:21] that is available in the description the
[03:24] eurofit.app
[03:25] uh you can give me for your workouts by
[03:27] having a little Avatar that you can grow
[03:29] when you work out and you gain XP and
[03:32] you can convene on the leaderboard and
[03:34] if you don't do your workout you are
[03:35] going to lose XP and you have a tower
[03:38] shrink
[03:39] um the app has been used with the has
[03:41] been built with the tech stack that is
[03:43] below
[03:44] um thanks to capacitor I was able to
[03:47] have not only a web app but also an app
[03:49] that is available on IOS and Android
[03:52] um I'm saying IOS and Android because
[03:54] um it's actually I checked earlier and
[03:58] it has been approved on Android so if
[04:00] you guys want to check it out it's live
[04:02] it's in production there is no one zero
[04:06] active device that no one has ever
[04:07] installed the app not even me on my
[04:09] phone so uh let's check the link it's
[04:12] normally available you can create an
[04:14] account yep it's available you can
[04:16] create an account it's free to have up
[04:19] to one workout avatars and and if you
[04:21] want to have more there is a premium
[04:23] version of the app which is 19 it's a
[04:25] one-time payment
[04:26] uh it's the same thing on iOS
[04:29] um and it's still in review yesterday we
[04:32] got uh unfortunately we got rejected by
[04:36] iOS for some weird uh stuff that I've
[04:39] changed and it's in review still so
[04:41] maybe later tonight you're gonna have an
[04:43] answer unfortunately I cannot launch
[04:46] today or tomorrow because I'm still
[04:48] waiting for iOS which is uh a third of
[04:51] you know the people who are going to use
[04:52] the app
[04:53] so that sucks a bit but um anyway it was
[04:56] built uh it's available in seven days so
[04:59] which is really good
[05:01] um I'm gonna give you a quick sneak peek
[05:02] of the video I I made so this is what I
[05:05] made today as a marketing video is going
[05:07] to be used to share on Twitter and on
[05:09] product tense to get some noise and
[05:12] attention awareness around the launch
[05:15] uh so here you go let's wash it together
[05:16] it's uh it's not incredible but I just
[05:19] built it today and hopefully you guys
[05:22] will find it fun
[05:23] it's a private video for now
[05:29] all right then there is no sound
[05:32] um if there's no sound it's not fun
[05:33] maybe I get copyright issues well let me
[05:36] show you
[05:39] shorts uh oh yeah because yeah the video
[05:42] for now is private maybe that's why it
[05:44] doesn't work
[05:47] seems like you have no restriction
[05:53] oh okay okay
[05:55] hey bro hey you look tired are you okay
[05:58] well it has been one hell of a Thursday
[06:01] so far all right all right let me guess
[06:03] he said you're gonna work out you went
[06:05] to the gym but you feel lazy I'm so
[06:07] sorry don't be sorry my friend you know
[06:09] what I made an app just for you it's
[06:11] called herofit you pick your workout
[06:13] Avatar and you exercise to get
[06:15] experience points and level up so what
[06:17] do we say thank you so much all right so
[06:20] come on give me the Triple M money
[06:22] muscles and uh Mana all right see you
[06:26] bud
[06:28] I think I need to tell that guy to stop
[06:30] calling me every day
[06:33] all right uh that's it that's what has
[06:36] been done today
[06:37] um
[06:39] yeah so
[06:42] um so this closed the series of uh seven
[06:45] day building live streaming a startup in
[06:47] public
[06:48] um what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna update
[06:50] you guys on Twitter whenever it's
[06:51] approved on Apple and then I am going to
[06:54] uh live stream the launch
[06:58] as soon as possible so whether they're
[07:00] approved today tomorrow
[07:01] um if we can have a new version if you
[07:05] have a launch together on a
[07:07] on the live streaming on YouTube that
[07:09] could be fun
[07:10] um so the video will be used for Twitter
[07:12] and product tenants I need to create
[07:13] some whatever pictures and maybe some
[07:16] copywriting stuff I'll probably I'll be
[07:18] launching I guess on Indie hackers
[07:20] Reddit
[07:22] um I'll try a hiker news even though I
[07:24] have no hopes
[07:26] um and we'll see where we go um I'm
[07:28] gonna share the traffic data and
[07:30] everything
[07:31] um if we get some sales I would be
[07:33] amazing if you can get like I don't know
[07:35] 100 worth of sale uh it's a bit of a
[07:38] dream but you know we can dream
[07:40] um that's pretty much it so yeah thank
[07:43] you so much for everyone who tuned in it
[07:46] has really been a fun Journey um if you
[07:48] are actually building in public I really
[07:50] recommend you to give these a try
[07:53] um even though you know you have one or
[07:55] two person watching the stream
[07:57] um
[07:57] being alone in a room all day but having
[08:00] a little someone next to you who is
[08:02] somehow watching it's it's very
[08:03] motivating it's it's pleasurable and I
[08:05] hope it was inspiring for some of you
[08:09] um so I'm very very grateful for that
[08:11] thank you so much for uh tuning in and I
[08:15] will see you for the launch
[08:18] bye bye everyone
