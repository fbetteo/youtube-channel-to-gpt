[00:00] on February 5th I went live on YouTube
[00:02] and I built a software from the first
[00:04] line of code to the first customer
[00:06] within 31 hours of streaming in this
[00:08] video I am going to share everything
[00:10] from how did I get the ID and validate
[00:12] it how I use four unconventional methods
[00:14] in order to build it really fast and
[00:16] that is probably going to make some
[00:17] developers cry and finally we are going
[00:19] to go over the launch part and how did I
[00:22] get visitors and get $2,000 of profit
[00:25] within the first week let's Jump Right
[00:27] In how to find startup IDs there are
[00:30] three ways to find them and my favorite
[00:33] by far is to scratch your own itches
[00:35] looking around you what you do on a
[00:36] daily basis and see if you find any
[00:39] boring annoying tasks that you don't
[00:41] like that you could have a product to
[00:43] automate it or delegate it thanks to
[00:45] that I've been able to generate money
[00:47] from every single launch that I made my
[00:49] best product so far ship has made
[00:51] $300,000 in 6 month thanks to this exact
[00:54] same way to find IDs for the startup
[00:56] that I built in 31 hours I was actually
[00:58] checking my stripe account seeing how
[01:00] much money I made in 2023 and I realized
[01:03] that I spent $1.6 th000 on stripe fees
[01:07] in order to generate PDF invoices I
[01:10] decided to turn off the option and my
[01:12] email were flooded with customers asking
[01:15] for invoices there we go I had a new
[01:17] product ID born just like that when you
[01:19] scratch your own itches it's much easier
[01:21] to validate a startup IDs because you
[01:23] actually a user of your own startup I
[01:26] also checked on Twitter and I saw that
[01:28] there is a recurring uh pattern of
[01:30] people complaining about stripe invoices
[01:32] so I had a sense of I might not be the
[01:34] only one in need of this tool there are
[01:37] tons of tips and advices to validate
[01:40] startup IDs um my method is a bit
[01:42] unconventional but it is to ship it so
[01:44] fast that if it's a flop it doesn't
[01:46] really matter so someone at the end of
[01:48] January 2024 I have a pain in my life
[01:51] and I have this startup ID to let uh
[01:54] customers generate invoices themselves
[01:56] so the sty businesses owners like myself
[01:58] don't have to do it I would normally
[01:59] start typing my first line of code and
[02:01] but instead I went live on YouTube and I
[02:03] built the entire startup during 31 hours
[02:06] of streaming from the first line of code
[02:08] to the first customer these are the
[02:10] methods that I use to build the startup
[02:12] really fasing is everything as a
[02:15] customer that's where you would go on a
[02:16] website if you don't fully understand
[02:18] what the product does and as a business
[02:19] owner that's how you pay the rent and
[02:22] also how you stay motivated over the
[02:24] long term so this is one of the first
[02:26] thing I brainstorm when building a
[02:28] product I found out last year that free
[02:30] plans don't really work for solo
[02:32] preneurs because most free users
[02:34] actually never convert to pay customers
[02:36] also that subscriptions are actually
[02:38] much harder to sell than onetime
[02:39] payments so I usually ditch
[02:41] subscriptions I start with onetime
[02:43] payments it's much easier to implement
[02:45] as a developer better for users because
[02:47] they don't have recurring cost and if
[02:49] the product goes viral and I end up
[02:52] having a bunch of users and there is a
[02:53] need for subscription I could still
[02:55] grandfather the first users and start
[02:58] charging subscription for the next user
[02:59] for one payment I found out that less
[03:02] than $30 is usually a good price point
[03:04] when you're selling a vitamin a product
[03:06] that is a nice to have but not a must
[03:08] have and less than $100 is usually a
[03:11] good price point for a painkiller so for
[03:13] my startup Zenvo I priced it at $69
[03:17] onetime payments um I have barely zero
[03:19] recurring cost the bandwidth is
[03:22] extremely cheap the emails to send
[03:24] secure tokens are also really cheap it's
[03:26] like usually $1 for a th000 emails so
[03:29] this is very unlikely that I would get a
[03:31] customer that would actually cost me
[03:33] money and finally I added a price encor
[03:35] to the product at
[03:36] $49 one time payment this gives you
[03:39] access to the the product for uh limited
[03:42] access with only one stripe account this
[03:44] is important because people have it's a
[03:46] new kind of product people have no clue
[03:48] what they're looking at and this helps
[03:50] them decide roughly what is this product
[03:54] worth if I add only one plan it would
[03:56] probably get them confused as a product
[03:59] obsess developer this part is the one I
[04:02] struggled the most for years it is to
[04:04] ship only one feature that one feature
[04:08] you cannot remove for his invoice it's
[04:10] the ability for customers to send a link
[04:13] to their customer so they can generate
[04:15] invoices anything that is not about that
[04:17] will be removed there is no way to
[04:19] preview the invoice no way to edit the
[04:21] details on the invoice no reset password
[04:23] thing there is just one big feedback
[04:26] button at the top of the user dashboard
[04:28] so that customers can let me know if
[04:30] they want a new feature here is the red
[04:32] pill most of startups fail so most of
[04:35] the features that we build won't be used
[04:37] by by users that's why I have this
[04:40] framework of building only one feature
[04:42] and shipping the first version of the
[04:44] product with only that feature there is
[04:46] another crucial part that is often
[04:48] overlooked by product obsess developers
[04:50] like me it is the Ling page 90% of
[04:53] people will never see your product so I
[04:55] spent 11 hours or 30% of the entire time
[04:59] building the the Ling page and there are
[05:00] a few components that are very crucial
[05:02] for Lending page that converts first is
[05:04] the problem agitation component it's a
[05:07] section on your landing page usually
[05:08] under the hero section that shows that
[05:11] you understand the customer pain it is
[05:13] very helpful because it shows respect it
[05:15] show that you care about your customer
[05:16] you know why they're here and if you
[05:18] speak their own language your visitors
[05:20] are much more likely to convert into
[05:21] paying customers the headline at the top
[05:23] of the hero section the H1 tag is very
[05:26] important it is the promise you make to
[05:28] your customers it should answer the
[05:30] question of why would I spend more of my
[05:33] precious time on this websites I never
[05:35] ship a startup without some kind of
[05:37] social proof at first when you don't
[05:39] have much visitors it's hard to get them
[05:41] but you can still send a few DMS on
[05:43] Twitter LinkedIn wherever this is your
[05:45] hanging outs and ask some people who are
[05:48] potential customers if they're willing
[05:49] to try your product for free there are
[05:51] tons of noise out there and when you
[05:53] have some kind of social proof on
[05:54] website you build trust and you increase
[05:56] your conversion rate because I always
[05:57] launch product without a free Tri people
[06:00] would have to pay before actually
[06:02] signing up I usually display a little
[06:04] demo video of the funer so me explaining
[06:07] the product so people know what they're
[06:08] buying and finally your product name is
[06:11] very important because that's what
[06:12] people will remember and later on share
[06:15] with potential users if they find it
[06:17] relevant if you are a software engineer
[06:19] you are going to cringe at the next part
[06:21] I do not use typescript I do not use G
[06:23] branches I do not test my code and I
[06:25] keep the same text stack for the past
[06:28] two years I still use mongod and I love
[06:30] it this is usually a loss of time
[06:31] because it creates constraints and
[06:34] whenever you want to move fast and break
[06:35] things it just make everything much
[06:37] slower because most startups fail I do
[06:40] not spend too much time thinking about
[06:41] the marketing side of things and instead
[06:43] I focus on the launch if I launch well
[06:46] I'll get enough data and visitors to
[06:48] know if it's worth it or not to invest
[06:50] more time into marketing and growing the
[06:52] product later after 28 hours of
[06:54] streaming the product Zenvo was done and
[06:56] I am going to cover the four places I
[06:58] launched the startup in order to get the
[07:00] first visitors and the first customers
[07:02] all right first I will always schedule a
[07:04] launch on product hunt there are many
[07:06] people browsing the site every day
[07:07] bringing some traffic to your product
[07:09] and giving you an initial boost and
[07:11] later on if things go well you could be
[07:13] targeted by other newsleter and media
[07:15] who would just fed off product hunts and
[07:17] you could see spikes later on in the
[07:18] future I also launched on Twitter I
[07:20] usually use Twitter as a bumper to P to
[07:24] pump my product hunt launch on Twitter
[07:26] people like new stuff so if you have
[07:27] some kind of product that is a bit
[07:29] trendy or if you use a good headline you
[07:30] can easily get some traffic even though
[07:32] you're getting started another platform
[07:34] I love and I always launch on is hicker
[07:36] news this is more random than Twitter in
[07:38] product hunt but if you craft a good
[07:40] headline your product can go crazy viral
[07:43] this is what I happened for my first
[07:45] product and I got something like 10,000
[07:47] visitors within the first 24 hours and I
[07:49] had zero audience and nothing back then
[07:51] and finally the subreddit side project
[07:54] it's still very active has a decent
[07:56] number of people can bring a couple
[07:58] hundred of visitors here your product so
[08:00] overall a good place to launch a startup
[08:02] I launched on all those four platforms
[08:04] within a time frame of like 2 to 3 hours
[08:06] and 24 hours later and about 4,000
[08:10] visitors on the site then voice made
[08:13] $800 and by the end of the week of
[08:15] launching he made $2,000 in profit and
[08:18] also received messages from customers
[08:20] who were happy to finally have a
[08:22] solution for stripe invoicing which is
[08:24] promising for the future I still do not
[08:26] know if I will focus on Z invoice or if
[08:28] I will let it run by itself I will wait
[08:30] to have at least 10,000 visitors on the
[08:33] site in order to see the dollars earned
[08:37] per visitor metric which is the only
[08:39] metric I track um to give you a
[08:42] reference my best website uh ship Fest
[08:45] gets almost $1 per visitor Revenue so
[08:48] for 100 visitor I could expect $100
[08:51] worth in revenue and my worst product
[08:53] got
[08:54] 0.06 per visitors it's quite
[08:57] oversimplified but I found it to be very
[08:59] relevant to see if there is some kind of
[09:01] Market fit if I get somewhere above
[09:05] $0.5 per visitor I think it's a product
[09:08] that's worth focusing on otherwise it's
[09:10] good to just let it run by itself fix
[09:11] some bugs be there for customer support
[09:13] if needed and just move on to the next
[09:15] one until you find the product that hits
[09:17] big in the last two years I started to
[09:19] ship my startups in days sometimes week
[09:22] instead of month and my Revenue went
[09:24] from $1 and $2,000 a month to now about4
[09:26] to $50,000 a month I think speed is the
[09:30] entrepreneurs best friend and these
[09:32] video summarize everything I do in order
[09:34] to ship fast if you like the video you
[09:36] can like the video and if you love the
[09:38] video you can subscribe to the channel
[09:39] if you're looking for another video I
[09:40] made one about how I got my first
[09:42] customer for a software I did not create
[09:45] you can check that out all right
[09:48] cheers
