[00:03] I love traveling but I hate going to the
[00:06] airport because I'm always afraid I
[00:08] forget important stuff did you bring
[00:09] your passport I love traveling but I
[00:12] hate going to the airport because either
[00:14] arrive too late or too early 3 hours
[00:17] before the flights it's way too early I
[00:19] love traveling but I hate going to the
[00:21] airport because I always have to repack
[00:23] my
[00:27] backpack but today is different today I
[00:30] like going to the
[00:38] [Music]
[00:46] airport today I'm flying business for
[00:48] the first time ever I'm so excited and
[00:51] she's too
[00:53] [Music]
[01:00] how does it
[01:01] work do you have a
[01:03] [Music]
[01:06] license I feel so much safe here now
[01:08] ladies and gentlemen this
[01:13] is I am never going back to economy
[01:15] class for
[01:23] this 12 years
[01:28] old crazy
[01:35] cheese for French people product Market
[01:39] fit I'm so full 10
[01:44] [Music]
[01:46] help I'm like a 12 years old kid out
[01:49] there it's like I feel like it's the day
[01:51] before Christmas well let me
[01:55] explain this was me back in Japan in one
[01:58] of the cheapest guest house I could find
[02:01] and after years lots of work and a
[02:03] little bit of luck things have changed
[02:05] and it's such a beautiful feeling and
[02:07] now it's time to go back to work
[02:16] [Music]
[02:35] 4 hours layover in Bangkok I better get
[02:38] some mango sticky rice
[02:40] [Music]
[03:14] W good morning it's time to get some
[03:17] work this is what it takes to make a
[03:19] million doll software first we need the
[03:22] multiple in software it's around 3 to
[03:24] four and I'm being very optimistic I'm
[03:26] going for the four multiple which means
[03:28] I need to make a software that makes
[03:30] around
[03:30] $250,000 per year so then we divide by
[03:33] the number of month and we get around a
[03:35] $20,000 monthly recurring Revenue
[03:37] software that's my goal for 2025 and the
[03:41] reason behind that is that I need a
[03:43] product that keeps me busy all the time
[03:45] let me explain okay so this is my
[03:48] portfolio of product and this is about
[03:49] what I earn per month but this is not
[03:51] how I'm going to get a million dollar
[03:53] software workbook PDF did not find
[03:55] product Market fits buy disputes and
[03:57] Zenvo are both startup that can be
[04:00] killed instantly with stripe they change
[04:02] one option and both of those startups
[04:03] are dead YouTube and Twitter are purely
[04:06] advertisement Revenue poop up is a fun
[04:08] one that eventually could get some right
[04:10] conversions but but it doesn't click
[04:13] with what I like to build so that's not
[04:15] going to be this one lunch viral is a
[04:17] course Indie page is my favorite
[04:19] software but it's a vitamin product is
[04:21] not something that people really need to
[04:23] solve a big issue so it's kind of hard
[04:25] to sell it and I doubt it can reach
[04:27] $20,000 per month so bye-bye and finally
[04:29] ship fast ship fast is great and well
[04:31] over $20,000 a month but if I spend my
[04:34] entire day building more features for
[04:35] this uh code based for developers in 6
[04:38] months it's going to end up being just
[04:39] like a massive toolbox that is unusable
[04:42] and so it defeats the purpose of the
[04:44] creation of this project to grow this I
[04:46] just need to make more startups so that
[04:48] the value I learn from them will feed
[04:50] cheap fast so that's not going to be
[04:52] this one which leaves me with zero
[04:53] software in my portfolio that can reach
[04:55] a million dollar per year now I do have
[04:57] a bunch of startups ID and and here is
[05:00] how I pick the one first I need to be
[05:02] the first user of that products I need
[05:04] to use it every day that's how I build
[05:07] this little pfolio of startups I used
[05:09] all of them then I need to fix a problem
[05:11] for people I care not a random stranger
[05:14] on the internet someone that I can
[05:16] relate then I want to build a product
[05:18] that doesn't have a free plan I tried it
[05:20] in the past and so few users convert to
[05:22] paid users so it's so much work as a
[05:24] solopreneur to grow this kind of
[05:26] products and finally the product should
[05:27] be a painkiller not a v in product
[05:30] meanings it has to solve a real pain in
[05:33] someone's life based on all those
[05:35] criteria that leaves me with only one
[05:37] startup idea that I have in mind for a
[05:39] while now I have a three months project
[05:41] that I really have to finish and then
[05:43] I'll jump straight on that software and
[05:45] hopefully 2025 will be the year to reach
[05:48] a million dooll
[05:50] [Music]
[05:57] software we're going back to Paris for
[05:59] only one
[06:00] [Music]
[06:16] reason that was worth 20 hours of flight
