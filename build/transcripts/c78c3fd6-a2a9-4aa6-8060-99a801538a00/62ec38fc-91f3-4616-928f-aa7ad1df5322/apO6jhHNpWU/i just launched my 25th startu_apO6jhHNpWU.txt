[00:01] [Music]
[00:15] what the [ __ ] is I'm getting a bug that
[00:17] is extremely weird uhhuh and within the
[00:20] last 2 minutes uhhuh we made $400 what
[00:25] yeah I don't know what the [ __ ] is going
[00:27] on here we made a 400 buck yeah two
[00:30] customers uhh they both like a very
[00:32] similar time frame uhhuh so this you
[00:35] know there a mix of like punch you in
[00:37] the face and like go [ __ ] yourself like
[00:39] deal you with your bug and at the same
[00:41] times there a liter Universe sending me
[00:43] another message like let me give you 400
[00:46] bucks oh wow but still [ __ ] I don't know
[00:49] I have a bug and I have no clue how to
[00:50] fix it wow that's a nice dish
[00:55] for
[00:58] what the this happens all the time I
[01:03] always blame whatever like I told you
[01:06] like it's a random error I don't know
[01:08] what's going on and Etc then I realize
[01:11] it's it's your fault it's my fault what
[01:13] did you what did you miss it's always
[01:15] the developer fault remember I was
[01:17] making a thumbnail for YouTube video a
[01:18] couple days ago and I put some codes
[01:21] where I kind of reveal API Keys which is
[01:24] secret Keys you're not supposed to
[01:25] reveal that API Keys AP ke and and for
[01:30] that I faked a I created fake API key
[01:33] inside of the project why so I can fake
[01:36] it no so I can fake it so I can make
[01:38] screenshots of fake API keys but the
[01:40] problem is I forget that I saved the
[01:42] file so now my my computer was reading
[01:44] these fake API keys that don't exist so
[01:46] of course he was telling me like hey I
[01:47] cannot
[01:48] [Music]
[01:57] connect oh [ __ ] that was fast
[02:00] I'm I'm literally about to launch data
[02:04] fast it's been three months I'm working
[02:05] on that startup um what I'm doing here
[02:08] is I'm testing the happy flow I'm
[02:11] logging with a new browser erase the
[02:14] cookies try a new email address and
[02:17] pretend I'm a new user try everything
[02:20] from visiting the landing page to using
[02:22] the product to being able to pay make
[02:24] sure the happy path is working um once
[02:28] I'm done with that I'm going to press
[02:29] play
[02:30] actually launch that startup I'm not
[02:32] going to lie I'm a bit stressed about it
[02:34] um let's
[02:37] go okay so this is not yet posted on the
[02:41] internet but this is a launch tweet and
[02:44] uh when I click here I officially launch
[02:48] this thre Monon old
[02:50] project [ __ ] the Tweet is live oh my
[02:56] [ __ ] it never gets easier it be three
[02:59] years launching 24 websites and I always
[03:02] have this stress whenever I launch I
[03:05] didn't add oh my boy and I don't
[03:07] remember if maybe I it's a website
[03:10] analytic tool and maybe I don't even
[03:12] track my own data oh no okay I'm
[03:15] tracking oh boy okay I I will turn on
[03:18] the camera again if something happens
[03:20] for now it's going to be uh just me
[03:22] overthinking again but at least it's
[03:24] public it's live it's
[03:27] launched I launched it
[03:30] it's been just 1 hour since I launched
[03:33] and there's there's 14 days of free TR
[03:36] so people cannot pay at the moment I got
[03:39] maybe 20 25 signups and two people
[03:41] already secur the launch deal and input
[03:44] their credit cards so the subscription
[03:47] and they are two active
[03:51] subscription this is maybe the road to
[03:53] the
[03:54] first $1 in monthly recuring Revenue
[03:57] with this product let's go
[04:00] [Music]
[04:05] that's why [ __ ] I see lots of uh advice
[04:08] for productivity out there and uh most
[04:11] of it I think is really toxic about work
[04:15] hard work hard work hard I've tried that
[04:17] in the past trying to work as much as I
[04:19] can setting up alarms so I can work
[04:21] earlier sometimes neglecting workouts
[04:24] and the only time I burn out like the
[04:25] two times I burn out in my life were
[04:27] times where I neglected sleep and I was
[04:30] not in shape I was not working out every
[04:31] day when I restarted the the Journey 3
[04:34] years ago I remember made making three
[04:35] rules for myself to make sure that I
[04:37] never burn out again and it's been like
[04:40] a thousand days almost and I've been
[04:42] working every day without taking any
[04:44] holiday and I I always feel great
[04:46] whether it's for work or whether it's my
[04:48] life with with a wife there's no no
[04:51] sense of burnout and I work way less
[04:53] than I used to and I'm way more
[04:55] productive I think working hard Works
[04:58] only if you don't neglect the three
[05:00] important part which are diet sleep and
[05:03] workout and mine is very simple I go to
[05:05] bed at the same time every single day no
[05:08] matter what and make sure I have 8 to 9
[05:10] hours of sleep and then clean food most
[05:13] of the time and uh not eating too late
[05:16] not eating too much to make sure I don't
[05:18] destroy my sleep and work out every
[05:21] single day no matter what cuz that's the
[05:23] way I tame the little box up there
[05:25] that's how I'm more focused that's how
[05:27] I'm more productive that's how I sleep
[05:29] better and the next days are even easier
[05:31] and I think I work from 10 or 11:00 a.m.
[05:34] until maximum 6:00 p.m. which is pretty
[05:38] decent day but nothing crazy and I'm
[05:40] able to do that every day without
[05:42] sacrificing what matters the most which
[05:44] means having a beautiful Lifetime with
[05:46] with a wife being healthy being happy
[05:48] not being stressed and and really it's
[05:51] all thanks to those three things workout
[05:53] diet and sleep
[06:00] I launched datas my 25th software
[06:03] yesterday and I just got to see the
[06:05] number after a good night of sleep and I
[06:08] was really not expecting any of this to
[06:10] be honest I was really pessimistic about
[06:12] the launch and every time I launch a new
[06:15] product the couple days before the
[06:17] actual launch date I always feel like
[06:19] this is not going to work and sometimes
[06:21] it's the case and sometimes like today
[06:23] it's very surprising I'm going to show
[06:25] you the numbers but just the takeaway
[06:27] and it's always the same but you never
[06:29] know until you actually launch so launch
[06:31] that thing now let me show you some of
[06:33] the numbers Okay so yesterday I made
[06:36] this tweet it's poly written um again
[06:39] the product is a beta of a beta of a
[06:41] beta it's a big product I really
[06:42] launched an early version and um man
[06:45] this like I would never expect to get
[06:47] this much likes and especially the
[06:48] number of comments which show that if
[06:51] you look at the comments it's very
[06:52] positive yeah the overall comments are
[06:54] really positive so that this really
[06:57] shows there's something going on um the
[06:59] numbers are actually great so this now I
[07:01] can use data fast to uh track the data
[07:04] that are happening on my site uh this is
[07:07] data fast you can see the spike coming
[07:09] from the launch uh 5.8 th000 visitors
[07:13] with one tweet this is crazy so now we
[07:16] can look a little bit deeper at what
[07:17] happens exactly so this is the data for
[07:20] just today I'm going to check the last
[07:22] 24 hours so that's a big spike of
[07:25] traffic and that's
[07:27] crazy X or Twitter brought four over
[07:31] 4,000 visitors it's insane um here there
[07:35] are
[07:37] 468 people who went to the signing page
[07:40] that's less than 10% coming from the
[07:43] homepage so here it's telling me that is
[07:45] this is bad this is pretty bad 10 less
[07:48] than 10% interest from click to from
[07:51] visitors to sign up I think this could
[07:54] be really improved uh there's some
[07:56] really potential here to improve it's
[07:58] it's very interesting that H almost the
[08:00] same amount of people are visiting the
[08:02] affiliate page as the one signing for
[08:04] the product so half of the people are
[08:06] here for the actual product which is the
[08:08] reason they click but half of them are
[08:10] also coming for the affiliate program
[08:13] this is this is interesting data and
[08:14] then again from signing to dashboard
[08:16] there's about 30% of people who did not
[08:21] sign up and then half of them did not
[08:23] even create try to create a website W
[08:26] the funnel here is pretty bad um I'm I'm
[08:29] pretty happy with the launch I I I was
[08:31] excited about it because you'll see why
[08:33] later when we come to Revenue data um
[08:36] but it's very interesting to see that
[08:38] the the top of the funnel is actually
[08:40] pretty
[08:41] bad uh let's have a look now at um so
[08:44] this is tripe so of course the product
[08:45] made 0 because because there is a 14
[08:48] days of free travel but what I do is I
[08:50] let people input their credit card
[08:52] details I charge them the zero until the
[08:54] end of the free trial the 14 days of
[08:56] free trial but by inputting the credit
[08:58] card details they're guarant guaranteed
[09:00] to secure the launch deal because I I
[09:02] cheap with the cheaper price and as I
[09:04] input more features the price will go up
[09:06] in the future and so that nudges people
[09:08] to input their credit card at the moment
[09:10] so they will be grandfather they will
[09:11] keep that launch deal forever and if you
[09:14] look at this those are uh all those are
[09:17] all the people who created an account
[09:19] and input their credit card details to
[09:21] secure the launch deal and they are I
[09:23] think 19 people 19 C 19 potential
[09:27] customers who have an active
[09:28] subscription which is going to start in
[09:30] 14 days most of them are on the 10K plan
[09:34] so that's a $9 a month plan and there
[09:36] are some of them on the 100,000 page
[09:38] views a month which is $19 at the moment
[09:41] I'm recording this video so this data is
[09:44] great the top of the phunnel lots of
[09:46] visitors very few sign up but among the
[09:48] people who sign up which is like
[09:49] somewhere around 150 20 almost 20 of
[09:52] them decided to give the credit card
[09:54] details to secure the launch deal this
[09:55] is really good and on top of that um I
[09:58] checked I bu this little um whatever
[10:00] feedback board for the product where
[10:03] only people who logged in and and have a
[10:05] subscription can submit stuff and I'm
[10:07] already collecting feedback from people
[10:09] so click tracking track events I think
[10:12] um yeah there is something here where uh
[10:15] literally tracking like events um on the
[10:17] website like custom goals like who signs
[10:19] up um and eventually making a funnel out
[10:22] of that I think it's this is the number
[10:24] one feature I'm going to work on after
[10:26] I'm done fixing all the little bugs I've
[10:27] seen and but this is great like this
[10:29] this is the day number one launching
[10:30] this product that's much better than I
[10:32] expected I'm collecting feedback it's
[10:34] going to take a while to get this
[10:36] product to a decent monthly recurring
[10:38] Revenue but I'm positive now I'm
[10:39] positive that it might make more than
[10:42] $100 a month and uh and that's beautiful
[10:45] all right so for today it's mostly
[10:49] there's no plans like I have a lot of
[10:50] like tiny little tasks here and there
[10:52] I'm going to check emails see if I get
[10:54] bugs reports from beta testers um since
[10:57] there have been a lot of people testing
[10:58] V app I was sleeping I expected to have
[11:01] broken at some point so today it's was
[11:04] it's going to be a day just like eating
[11:06] bugs for breakfast this is crazy too
[11:09] this is absolutely crazy so I launched
[11:12] yesterday and within 24 hours the
[11:15] ranking of that new website it's a brand
[11:18] new website no one owned it before it
[11:21] jumped from 0 to
[11:24] 23 that is just crazy and that is at
[11:28] this point it's an unfair Advantage cuz
[11:30] I would never be able to do that but
[11:32] because I built 20 plus websites in the
[11:34] past all of them have a little bit of
[11:36] like domain reputation and so whenever I
[11:38] launch a new startup I add this new
[11:40] domain to the previous domains I owned
[11:43] and it tells Google that the new domain
[11:45] I'm launching is trust trustworthy and
[11:47] so Google will start pushing it up right
[11:49] away and within a couple hours now if I
[11:52] type data fast the name of my new
[11:54] startup Google will rank in first place
[11:58] this is this is really crazy crazy so
[12:00] what I do usually is this this is for
[12:01] instance this is one of my websites and
[12:04] then at the bottom in the footer I had
[12:06] right here the new website and these are
[12:09] all of my other websites so that
[12:11] Google's trust these websites and then
[12:14] he's going to trust the new website that
[12:16] I just that I just created I think when
[12:19] you're getting started it makes sense to
[12:22] have a free project where you research
[12:25] some keywords on Google so you know
[12:27] where to rank like a I don't like a
[12:29] hobby project something you're
[12:30] passionate about that step by step month
[12:33] after month is going to start building a
[12:35] tiny reputation and then later when you
[12:38] launch a new startup you can always add
[12:39] your site to that previous site and you
[12:41] never start again from zero and uh
[12:44] actually I created this art this blog
[12:47] article is 100% free it's how do you get
[12:50] customers with programmatic SEO it's
[12:52] basically how do you create websites
[12:54] that rank on Google using SEO this is
[12:57] for instance an website I built and I I
[12:59] don't touch this website and over time
[13:01] it gets more impression more clicks so
[13:03] Google increase the domain rating and
[13:06] then I can use that website to rank my
[13:08] new websites if you want the article
[13:11] it's it's literally in my blog it's Mark
[13:13] marlb have.com this is where I share
[13:17] everything I've learned in the journey
[13:19] and definitely recommend these kind of
[13:20] like fun hobby projects to get started
[13:23] at the beginning
[13:30] all right about to wrap for today
[13:32] so the 24 hours recap for the launch is
[13:36] 6,000 visitors around 200 signups and 21
[13:40] people who input their credit card
[13:41] details which I believe is great uh need
[13:45] to fix the top of the funnel I spent
[13:47] most of the day fixing bugs and also
[13:49] replying to customer support because
[13:52] well the app is new it's only be tested
[13:54] by me and three friends so there are
[13:56] some stuff that are not intuitive so
[13:58] people ask questions about how to do
[14:00] this um is it how that should work etc I
[14:03] think tomorrow will be another bug
[14:05] fixing day but now it's 6:30 p.m. I
[14:08] really have to log off because I need to
[14:11] wind down otherwise my brain never stops
[14:13] and I really want to have good sleep
[14:15] that's how I'm going to be able to be
[14:16] productive tomorrow so I'm going to turn
[14:18] off this computer go back see my wife
[14:21] have a little walk maybe outside in the
[14:23] dark alone and uh ready to crush it
[14:26] tomorrow
[14:27] [Music]
[14:31] that's all there is to
[14:32] [Music]
[14:43] it hey so what did you do you say you
[14:45] make websites yeah okay and you
[14:47] freelance and you work from buy yes okay
[14:50] and you said you started from zero yeah
[14:53] and now how much you're making a month I
[14:54] make like around like 4K this month
[14:57] $4,000 a month yeah that's pretty good
[14:59] for
[15:00] buddy it's happening for
[15:03] real so oh yeah for now there is$ in
[15:07] Revenue but if we scroll to the monthly
[15:11] recuring Revenue there it
[15:14] is234 monthly recuring Revenue this this
[15:18] is uh this is just 2 days after the
[15:21] launch and uh there's a 14 days of free
[15:24] trial so people cannot pay for the
[15:25] product but they can inut their credit
[15:27] card so they start their subscription
[15:29] right after the free trial and stri
[15:31] calculate that as monthly recing Revenue
[15:33] already so within 12 day I think this
[15:36] monthly recing Revenue will be converted
[15:38] into actual revenue and there we go just
[15:40] like this the first step of making $1 in
[15:43] monthly recing revenue is completed
[15:45] still a long way to go until I reach a
[15:48] million dollar in valuation but that's
[15:50] that's a that's a little step already so
[15:52] now this is what I am doing in order to
[15:55] hopefully grow this product first I set
[15:58] up a feed back board so this is a little
[16:01] um something I built where only people
[16:04] who are authenticated to my product can
[16:06] submit features and then they are ranked
[16:09] here from the Most Wanted feature at the
[16:12] top to the least wanted feature what I'm
[16:14] going to do is I'm just going to go over
[16:16] each feature step by step the first one
[16:18] the Most Wanted feature first build it
[16:20] ship it let people know that I have
[16:21] shipped that feature and hope that by
[16:23] making a better product uh my people
[16:25] will maybe spread the word love the
[16:28] product and stay for for longer another
[16:30] thing I did and I wish I did that
[16:33] earlier it hurt a lot but it works so
[16:35] well is to ask people blun feedback so I
[16:40] made this tweet a little recap of what
[16:43] happened after the launch and here I
[16:45] asked if you visited the site but did
[16:47] not sign up why be blunt please and this
[16:52] brought so many replies 114 replies and
[16:56] each of them is a masterpiece all of
[16:59] them really really hurts but each of
[17:02] them is a little Pebble to build a
[17:04] successful software so what I'm going to
[17:07] do now is I'm just going to get read
[17:09] these over and over until I understand
[17:12] exactly why people did not sign up why
[17:14] people did not purchase and uh that's it
[17:16] that's the whole marketing strategy I
[17:19] hope I'll find the right problem the
[17:21] right objections until I clicks with the
[17:23] audience and hopefully build a product
[17:25] and hopefully reach that 1 million in
[17:27] valuation now it's same to grind time
[17:30] for no man life is two step dancing with
[17:33] theil trying not to lose my balance but
[17:36] God bless the
[17:40] K now I would say the most
[17:46] important so how was the
[17:49] launch um man you know the numbers is
[17:51] good very happy I think we have around
[17:54] 25 happy users 25 yeah already yeah well
[17:59] that's nice yeah I didn't check today so
[18:01] maybe a little bit more than that so you
[18:02] told me you're going to grow it to 1
[18:04] million
[18:06] set long journey to go but how we going
[18:09] to actually do it how we going to grow
[18:11] it I mean uh okay so now we around two
[18:14] or 300 in monthly recing Revenue uhhuh 1
[18:17] million SS is like uh I think 25,000 in
[18:19] monthly recording Revenue okay so that's
[18:22] I kind of have to like add two or zero
[18:25] to that yeah okay I I asked people on
[18:27] Twitter why they don't they sign why
[18:30] they visit the site but why they didn't
[18:32] sign up and I I learned something very
[18:34] interesting yeah so when I asked this
[18:36] question people said I don't understand
[18:38] why I would switch to this new product
[18:41] okay I I realized we ship fast and then
[18:44] my mind forg it yeah and then now I'm
[18:46] launching and I I I didn't pay attention
[18:47] to that yeah I have to find the right
[18:50] angle the right marketing angle what
[18:53] kind ofle see when I launched it fast uh
[18:56] there were already tons of boiler plates
[18:57] out there the thing is shias stood out
[18:59] like there was there was like this boom
[19:01] effect and people are like oh yeah
[19:02] that's night and people spread the world
[19:04] and yet shias is just another Boer plate
[19:07] mhm I think what worked is because I had
[19:10] a really totally new marketing approach
[19:12] like a totally new marketing angle it
[19:14] was not just it was not just a code base
[19:17] to do XYZ it was a tool for you to stop
[19:20] overthinking true and the fact that I
[19:23] branded it with a very emotional thing
[19:26] mhm I think that's the reason to off the
[19:29] reason they visit the site but they
[19:30] don't sign up is because my tool is just
[19:33] another tool it has nothing special it's
[19:35] just analytics it's boring and plus that
[19:38] I am a tiny little company it's just me
[19:40] why would you you know why would you
[19:41] migrate all your data to my software
[19:43] true this is where marketing angle angle
[19:46] come from this is where I have to give
[19:50] people a clear reason why they would
[19:52] sign up something that makes my site
[19:55] very special so that instead of
[19:57] comparing my tool with other tools the
[19:59] my tool would just be a different market
[20:01] like it's like there's no way to compare
[20:03] it with others because it's not like the
[20:06] others so how we going to
[20:10] differentiate you know I cannot say that
[20:12] okay okay we continue but that's a good
[20:16] point but I think it's something to
[20:17] remember for every product that I launch
[20:20] something that anyone who is launching a
[20:22] product should think about why is it
[20:25] different why is it special why someone
[20:29] would share this to their friends is it
[20:31] worth sharing and I think if you can
[20:33] answer that in a single sentence you're
[20:36] onto something M so is it like about
[20:40] more marketing find the angle like oh
[20:43] that's different or you have to really
[20:44] also build the features that is very
[20:47] different man I I I am a strong believer
[20:50] that if you package it in a way that's
[20:52] difference even though the product is
[20:54] not fully ready mhm you're doing a good
[20:57] service for people because you show that
[20:59] maybe there is a solution out there for
[21:00] them and so you can afford to make a
[21:03] product that's not perfect at the
[21:05] beginning it's it's okay because it's
[21:07] finally someone who like oh this guy he
[21:10] has a solution for me if I just make
[21:12] another Analytics tool then what is it
[21:14] like I'm a I'm another funer like
[21:17] there's no I'm making just I'm making
[21:18] people lose their time now if I brand it
[21:21] which I'm going to do I'm going to
[21:22] Rebrand it towards a new thing a new
[21:24] kind of marketing a new kind of
[21:26] analytics then it's worth people time
[21:29] yeah and then if I keep investing my
[21:31] time and I deliver on the promise I'll
[21:33] make hopefully that's the road to this 1
[21:36] million software even though you don't
[21:38] know the angle fully you can just test
[21:40] in the market early so actually you will
[21:42] get the angle from people not by
[21:44] yourself that is it man oh yeah this is
[21:47] exact perfect Market fit so yeah good
[21:49] question the person behind the camera is
[21:52] an AI hello I'm an AI assistant AI
[21:55] girlfriend that's the new kind of tool
[21:58] no that's the
[21:59] this video I want you watching to think
[22:03] why is your product different and make
[22:05] your entire Ling page could be around
[22:07] that until the next one I hope you keep
[22:10] completely control
