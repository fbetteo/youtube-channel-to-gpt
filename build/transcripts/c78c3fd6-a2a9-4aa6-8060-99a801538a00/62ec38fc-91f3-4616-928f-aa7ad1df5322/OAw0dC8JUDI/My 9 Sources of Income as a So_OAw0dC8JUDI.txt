[00:00] hey it's Mark in the last 3 years I
[00:02] taught myself how to code managed to get
[00:03] a software engineer job and get fired
[00:06] and I also built 20 websites that are
[00:08] now making $50,000 a month at 90% profit
[00:11] and zero employee I'm going to break
[00:13] down all those sites but before I'm
[00:15] going to share uh how I ended up in this
[00:17] journey in 2021 I was living at my
[00:19] parents house and I was a bit bored so I
[00:21] Tau myself how to code using UD me and
[00:24] uh YouTube videos uh this is me learning
[00:27] how to program at my parents place um
[00:29] within a few months I started to apply
[00:30] on Angel list which is now I guess well
[00:33] found and I miraculously found a job as
[00:36] a junior software engineer and within 5
[00:40] months they fired me CU they realized I
[00:42] was a really mediocre programmer but
[00:44] thanks to the job I realized that I
[00:46] actually love programming because it
[00:48] kind of reminded me of Lego which I used
[00:50] to uh be crazy about when I was a kid
[00:52] where I could build stuff and with
[00:54] programming you can show it to people
[00:56] and it can be of use of other people so
[00:59] back then uh it was the end of 2021 I
[01:01] moved to Bali and I decided to work on
[01:04] projects of my own build my own websites
[01:07] my first website was uh this little
[01:09] thing where uh you can find movies that
[01:12] are related to your mood if you're in a
[01:14] romantic mood maybe you want to watch
[01:16] some uh whatever movies um and I get I
[01:19] get to love the process of like building
[01:21] and launching those websites um I would
[01:23] go on product Huns and share my uh
[01:26] website there it would uh get a little
[01:28] bit of attention I will also share it on
[01:30] Twitter uh with other people doing
[01:32] similar things where I also get to me a
[01:34] lot of friends uh I studed Twitter in
[01:36] 2022 with zero followers and the fact
[01:39] that I was sharing what I was doing um I
[01:41] managed to build a little audience there
[01:43] and made a lot of friends and when I
[01:44] realized I could actually also make a
[01:46] living by building website I studed to
[01:48] focus on other tools like AI tools like
[01:50] this one where uh you can make an entire
[01:53] landing page uh than thanks to AI um I
[01:56] built softwares I bu I built
[01:58] productivity tools uh anything think
[02:00] that I could add a pricing on so I could
[02:01] pay my bills and fast forward to
[02:05] 2024 um my Revenue in the last 30 days
[02:08] is almost
[02:09] $60,000 and I am a solo entrepreneur I
[02:12] built about 20 websites most of them
[02:16] never made money uh a lot of them may
[02:19] make just very like very little money
[02:21] and one of them is uh paying the bill
[02:24] much more than I need so I'm going to
[02:25] break down the revenue for all those
[02:27] this is making uh less than $100 month
[02:30] it's a uh AI tool that will create
[02:33] workbooks uh so you can practice a new
[02:36] language based on topics that you like
[02:37] so if you like uh K-pop you can learn
[02:39] Korean with K-pop topics it will craft
[02:41] the workbook just for
[02:43] you um I also built a software called
[02:46] viral libot I used to work with escape
[02:48] room businesses uh to help them get more
[02:51] uh customers they would get a messenger
[02:54] bot which is what I called a viral bot
[02:58] um this is it on messenger it's a an
[02:59] automated conversation with uh it's not
[03:01] even an AI it's just a basic um you know
[03:04] just a basic replies but you can play
[03:05] games as a player and you can say oh I
[03:07] want to play this game and the bot will
[03:10] reply to you with uh some riddles and if
[03:12] you solve the puzzle you can get a
[03:14] discount coupon for the escap room
[03:16] businesses I work with and that would
[03:18] get them more business and I would
[03:19] charge a monthly subscription for that I
[03:21] also built a buy dispute it's making uh
[03:24] I would say less than $1,000 a month
[03:27] which is a tool a no code tool for
[03:30] developers like me who work with uh with
[03:34] tripe uh to avoid getting dispute
[03:37] chargeback like Angry customers that
[03:39] would uh make yourself get banned from
[03:41] the platform uh it connects to the plat
[03:43] to your strap accounts and you can add
[03:44] rules uh where you say oh if this then
[03:48] that and if something suspicious happen
[03:50] then prevents the action uh I also built
[03:52] something called Indie page is kind of
[03:54] like a link tree for entrepreneurs where
[03:56] you can showcase your startups and you
[03:58] can connect with your your payment
[04:00] provider so it shows your revenue and it
[04:02] links to all your startups it's making
[04:05] um actually this is built using Indie
[04:08] page uh it's making 1.2k in the last 30
[04:11] days um I also created a course recently
[04:15] uh because some of the video some of the
[04:17] product that I would launch on Twitter
[04:19] and product hunt uh I would use videos
[04:22] like this one where I would embed myself
[04:25] with a personality either in a movie or
[04:27] someone that's famous uh to help the
[04:29] launch uh to get some awareness during
[04:32] the launch and this made uh about $6,000
[04:36] in the last 30 days and finally uh my
[04:39] biggest product is ship fast it's a code
[04:43] template um that you can use to ship
[04:46] startups faster I used to so because I
[04:49] made 20 website I realized I was doing
[04:51] the same thing over and over uh which is
[04:53] like sending up a database uh sending
[04:55] emails to the customers processing
[04:56] payments handling the subscriptions and
[04:58] so I package all that into a bottle
[05:01] plate and this is making um about
[05:03] $50,000 $50,000 a month and finally uh
[05:08] this is not a website but I got paid by
[05:10] Twitter uh this is recent um it's paying
[05:14] something between $150 a month to
[05:18] sometimes $400 a month uh which is
[05:20] pretty cool because I love Twitter so
[05:22] being paid for something a love it's
[05:23] it's super nice um and yeah um I didn't
[05:27] count this but I also sold three
[05:29] startups last year on this platform
[05:31] acquire. comom uh it's a place where you
[05:34] can buy and sell mro startup like a
[05:37] product like a habit tracker for
[05:38] instance uh I sold one for
[05:40] $10,000 uh this is this allows people
[05:43] like me who have no ambitious to um
[05:45] build a unicorn or go crazy and raise VC
[05:48] and have a lot of employees it allows
[05:50] people like like me um just you know
[05:52] make a living and and get into the
[05:54] startup world without uh going super big
[05:57] and finally I have a new later uh that's
[06:00] called just ship it that is about to
[06:02] reach 10,000 subscribers it's not
[06:04] monetized and I have no intent to
[06:05] monetize it U but I keep sharing my
[06:08] learnings in there and if you want to
