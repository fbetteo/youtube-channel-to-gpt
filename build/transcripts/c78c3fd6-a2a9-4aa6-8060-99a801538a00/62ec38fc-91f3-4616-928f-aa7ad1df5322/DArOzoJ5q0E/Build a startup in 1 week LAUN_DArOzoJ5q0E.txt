[12:30] uh just checking if this is going okay
[12:34] this is gone perfect
[12:37] oh well we have to make this
[12:52] hello uh I think
[12:58] we're gonna open
[13:00] um herofit we're going to make a mini
[13:02] logo
[13:03] or a mini video I guess for
[13:08] I'm running out of time what are you
[13:10] doing bro
[13:12] okay this is absolutely useless but
[13:14] we're gonna make an animated logo
[13:18] anyway we have too much time it's not
[13:20] fun so
[13:22] we're gonna call it a square square
[13:25] video
[13:27] um
[13:28] and uh we're gonna put a I guess a
[13:32] background that is going to be white
[13:39] uh
[13:43] and here we're just going to add emojis
[13:45] and we're going to rotate a few maybe
[13:47] three or four images
[13:53] simple title
[13:57] I'm gonna say this is this boy
[14:04] 50 maybe hold on way bigger
[14:07] 450 maybe even 600 bro
[14:11] 700 800.
[14:19] where are you buddy you are here
[14:23] all right I think that'll do the work
[14:26] um
[14:28] and what we're gonna do we're gonna just
[14:30] rotate oh maybe just 10 seconds should
[14:32] be way enough
[14:34] five seconds should be way enough
[14:36] and we're gonna rotate that thing maybe
[14:38] three times
[14:42] but as I go if I do here if I do a
[14:46] um run
[14:49] all right genderless character
[14:57] all right it's way enough
[15:04] or anything let's do five
[15:10] after all it's a game so somehow it
[15:13] needs to be entertaining
[15:16] even though that's more procrastination
[15:18] than anything else
[15:23] um
[15:24] which character are we gonna do cyclists
[15:28] I think we have a cyclist here
[15:30] we are going to have a maybe a basket
[15:36] there we go maybe a girl
[15:38] 's power boom
[15:41] there's no one here maybe you're gonna
[15:42] put aside please

[30:29] already
[30:31] okay
[30:35] okay
[30:37] um I think we are good
[30:40] um I am going to jump into the coding
[30:42] part real quick because I need the
[30:43] banner
[30:45] uh your feet this is it index page
[30:51] we're running the server render product
[30:54] hence
[30:56] okay so we have absolutely no product
[30:58] tense stuff in there I need to import it
[31:08] what time is it okay the warrant time
[31:11] uh okay this is the wrong app obviously
[31:13] or maybe it's still running the server
[31:15] for this one
[31:16] what am I doing oh yeah here
[31:19] but now we should be able to re-run this
[31:21] right port
[31:25] get back to me okay here fake game find
[31:28] your Fitness
[31:29] um
[31:32] did I import the pictures or something
[31:33] already products
[31:36] once
[31:38] we get nothing from product tents it's
[31:41] okay uh so I have a mini
[31:47] product and banner from somewhere on
[31:49] other websites I think I'm just gonna
[31:51] import it
[31:52] um and I think it's going to be a fixed
[31:54] Banner at the top
[31:56] because yeah there's my Twitter Link at
[31:58] the bottom so it needs to be at the top
[31:59] here
[32:00] and then in that case I am going to
[32:03] which app is that
[32:05] okay maybe we take this one
[32:10] this is a code for another app
[32:12] I'm just going to steal it
[32:16] render
[32:19] product tense
[32:21] here you go
[32:24] and we also need to import the picture
[32:39] a render product tent we're gonna put it
[32:42] in here

[32:47] right product and Link which is
[32:51] zero feet this one
[32:53] okay
[32:55] and we just need the image
[32:58] is somewhere in those apps
[33:05] novel public product internal group
[33:09] we're gonna put it
[33:10] uh
[33:13] audience we're going to put it in what's
[33:15] the name here with it
[33:18] public
[33:22] here we go oh I cannot use that one I
[33:27] need to use another one
[33:29] yeah this is going to be [Â __Â ] up
[33:33] um
[33:40] render product and we are going to say
[33:42] true
[33:43] and it's here but it's a bit too big
[33:46] we're gonna make it sticky
[33:49] Sub Zero
[33:54] this is not sticky
[33:59] this is absolutely not sticky or are we
[34:02] running this
[34:03] Sub-Zero what have I done any why
[34:12] uh what did I do
[34:15] maybe I can still make it the next
[34:18] render pH
[34:23] antom pH
[34:30] you don't want to be sticky at me if I
[34:32] don't run
[34:34] I'm not updating the right app and this
[34:37] is definitely not going to work I don't
[34:39] know it's actually updating the right
[34:40] app what have I done
[34:44] what are you doing bro
[34:46] hello you don't want to be sticky
[34:52] oh maybe you're sticky at the wrong
[34:56] because no
[35:00] turn
[35:01] because there is no Diva somehow
[35:05] gonna be a weird stuff but still not
[35:11] what am I doing
[35:15] all right you don't want to be sticky
[35:17] put it
[35:19] which you fixed
[35:24] why wouldn't that work
[35:30] put it somewhere
[35:33] in that Eve
[35:36] you're still oh I think I know I [Â __Â ]
[35:39] up the CSS for the app
[35:42] would be this thing here
[35:44] related but if you put it at the top
[35:47] Maybe
[35:48] just fixed at the top
[35:51] okay that works now
[35:54] and I want you to be sticky
[35:56] uh okay uh you're gonna be fixed and
[35:59] then I'm gonna have to do some dirty
[36:01] stuff
[36:05] super dirty stuff we're gonna do if
[36:09] I'm gonna put that back in I'm gonna say
[36:11] if
[36:13] um is
[36:14] product
[36:16] so we're gonna say padding tub
[36:20] 24.
[36:22] or nothing
[36:24] that possible Penny yeah maybe just
[36:28] margin top
[36:29] here we'll see
[36:31] it just seems to work
[36:38] okay you are working
[36:42] maybe make it fixed yep
[36:44] yeah I had to make it fixed because I
[36:46] think I use a weird CSS classes for the
[36:49] app on capacitor
[36:52] so here we are uh okay this is
[36:55] not too bad
[36:58] all right
[37:00] I think you just need inner inner
[37:03] with food products x equal four I guess
[37:10] all right so that doesn't look too messy
[37:16] it opens the right link perfect gamified
[37:19] Fitness Pro workout Avatar
[37:25] it looks good and small
[37:27] thermal and it looks okay on big as well
[37:34] or padding we are not too bad I think

[42:18] of you this is a list of
[42:21] places I usually ship
[42:23] startups
[42:27] we can try I can use I don't know
[42:31] The Hive index uh probably not a good
[42:34] fit for this
[42:36] celebrate it we're gonna check it out in
[42:38] the hackers product hunt
[42:41] and of course Twitter
[42:47] um
[42:48] all right I think we can start preparing
[42:50] the tweets for this thing
[42:54] um we have a video normally that's made
[42:56] especially for the launch
[43:00] where yep live today on protectants
[43:05] that's gonna fit somewhere there
[43:10] or not here you are here
[43:14] I do desktop and
[43:19] here we go 62 megabytes
[43:23] what are we going to say to Twitter

[44:38] it may take a while to upload the video
[44:39] okay that's uploading
[44:45] hashtags
[44:48] what hashtags are usually
[44:51] nice oh maybe I could use
[44:54] the building public one that's a good
[44:56] point
[44:57] I think I'm gonna make a sick on tweet
[44:59] that is going to be more about
[45:01] the the overall experience
[45:05] like the live and everything yep okay
[45:07] good point I'm gonna do that
[45:10] um playlist
[45:13] building private stuff
[45:19] where is the link to that playlist here
[45:22] maybe
[45:25] um
[45:31] you are here okay
[45:38] I need service okay
[45:42] would love your support
[45:44] love lyrics Sports
[46:09] with your emojis are
[46:13] Fitness Emoji not the best
[46:15] game for Fitness great workout avatars
[46:17] we love your support
[46:20] this part this app
[46:29] in seven days
[46:32] thanks
[46:38] binge 60 hours
[47:01] on the live on YouTube in seven days
[47:06] the French guy
[47:10] thanks for everyone thanks to everyone
[47:13] contributed
[47:24] disciples building a lot we'll build
[47:25] Life on YouTube
[47:27] trained
[47:30] Live on YouTube in seven days here
[47:33] was a video of a French
[47:37] guy is scratching his head
[47:45] I think we are good
[47:48] if I'm pretty 10 hero feed game face if
[47:51] it's nice Curry workout avatars
[48:00] um
[48:09] is that it
[48:11] yeah I didn't know I would finish
[48:14] earlier than expected uh
[48:18] in the hiker
[48:20] and
[48:22] and all the rest can be done later I
[48:24] think it would be nice to send this link
[48:26] to my parents my family
[48:30] um
[48:33] it's good to I kind of have a feeling
[48:35] that product times usually it's uh
[48:38] you get a shot in the first hour and if
[48:40] during the first one or two hours you
[48:42] don't get in the top five it's very hard
[48:45] to make it higher
[48:48] um because I guess there is a fallacy
[48:50] where the winners always gets more a
[48:52] vote even though the app is super
[48:53] awesome
[48:54] I think it's important to make B around
[48:57] your computer and launch and make sure
[48:59] that you know all the people who care
[49:00] about the app would help you and shoot
[49:02] it up in the first hour
[49:07] um because yeah
[49:09] it's probably okay I'm gonna launch uh
[49:12] I'm gonna tweet make sure the video is
[49:14] done okay it's uploaded
[49:16] maybe we can do this try
[49:18] it works
[49:20] I spend some times on it so maybe come
[49:22] on give me the good quality
[49:26] Instagram
[49:30] ready
[49:35] people get the safer on ID to Launch
[49:42] by the way
[49:45] we're live we're live launch
[49:52] and I'm going to share the link to it
[49:53] our little call
[49:57] our little
[50:00] the way we are live now for the launch
[50:07] Twitter is gonna be like this guy is
[50:09] sharing Three Links in three tweets
[50:11] please do not do not show his content to
[50:14] anyone
[50:16] I left the lunch now
[50:21] uh dang when you started his life on
[50:24] product turns hero feeds gamifies
[50:26] here
[50:32] if gamify is your Fitness grow
[50:36] workout avatars would love your support
[50:39] product turns okay open source product
[50:43] was landed number three I posted on
[50:44] production and when else I completely
[50:45] forget about the launch
[50:48] oh [Â __Â ] man that's a that's a good story
[50:52] and mine was number three that's really
[50:54] good
[50:55] my open source product line in
[51:00] it's a good it's a good anecdote it
[51:03] would fit well in a podcast or something
[51:06] I ranked
[51:09] I got featured on product hunts and I
[51:11] didn't know or
[51:13] that could be fun it's a nice uh nice
[51:16] catchy phrase with this
[51:24] um
[51:31] let me think
[51:40] I think that is I think we're good I
[51:43] think I mean the rest is important but I
[51:45] think the rest is not time sensitive I
[51:46] can I'll write I'll write for so I think
[51:49] I will I don't think I will do those two
[51:52] there are more startup stuff
[51:57] um I think this one is only for
[51:59] communities I think I'm gonna do SUB I'm
[52:01] gonna find some subreddit I could
[52:03] eventually be a fit I'm not sure there
[52:05] will be one because my app Reddit hates
[52:07] promotions and my app is literally
[52:09] saying that if you want to have one
[52:12] two or more workout avatars you have to
[52:14] play so I'm not sure this is gonna work
[52:17] um I'm still going to explore it I think
[52:19] I'm also gonna post the same thing on
[52:21] product and communities and Indie hacker
[52:24] I'm gonna write
[52:25] I think I'm gonna write about these
[52:27] what's happening right now and how
[52:31] it was helpful for me to be consistent
[52:35] and how this little thing which is just
[52:38] I just I literally pressed a button and
[52:40] then for one week I was super productive
[52:42] and I think this could be a really a
[52:44] good strategy for anyone who is uh not
[52:47] super motivated and and those kind of
[52:49] things and it's I think it's like a next
[52:51] step of building public and it's a good
[52:53] I feel it's a good you know like um
[52:57] motivation trick it's a good
[52:58] productivity trick is a
[53:01] someone could be witching your your
[53:03] screen so you cannot just do whatever
[53:06] uh you have to build so that's I think
[53:08] I'm going to write about this
[53:09] in um in a hiker news I'm very skeptical
[53:14] for this product but maybe I can say
[53:15] something like a game you find a habit a
[53:18] gamified fitness tracker
[53:22] I'll try something like this very simple
[53:28] um
[53:29] oh I know what I can do away of course
[53:31] I'm going to launch on Reddit there is a
[53:33] really nice subreddit if you
[53:36] guys uh haven't tried oh no
[53:39] I'm gonna be screwed over
[53:41] [Â __Â ]
[53:44] oh [Â __Â ]
[53:45] Indonesia
[53:49] how am I gonna be able to post this
[53:51] thing
[53:52] I think I'll do Reddit at the end
[53:54] um so Reddit I cannot show you because I
[53:56] had to turn on my VPN if I turn on my
[53:58] VPN uh this stream might just end like
[54:02] it did the other day so and I cannot go
[54:05] and Reddit because I'm in Indonesia and
[54:07] for some reason I absolutely ignore
[54:10] um actually porn is banned here so
[54:13] Reddit is not I mean you can find porn
[54:15] on Reddit so whatever you can also find
[54:16] porn on Twitter so I don't know anyway
[54:18] Reddit is buying in Indonesia
[54:20] um which means I cannot show you the
[54:21] subreddit but I'm gonna write it down
[54:23] somewhere here you guys probably know it
[54:27] but this is a really good one it's kind
[54:29] of like the building public community
[54:31] but inside
[54:34] um inside Reddit people are very
[54:37] supportive people get give usually good
[54:38] feedback
[54:40] and
[54:41] um it's nice it's a nice one
[54:44] I'm gonna do it at the end of the stream
[54:46] just in case you know like I'm screwed
[54:48] or something
[54:54] oh yeah and I'm gonna sell off corals
[54:56] built in public wow that's a pretty
[54:59] massive
[55:00] wheat
[55:02] okay the video is uploaded
[55:05] um
[55:07] right we're just waiting for
[55:10] the time the clock to run
[55:12] I'm gonna brush my teeth
[55:16] that's a claim
[55:25] I think this is a bit boring I'm gonna
[55:27] just edit that part
[55:32] um
[55:34] I use this space Bros it's my app of
[55:36] course I use it
[55:42] where are you mister
[55:44] okay edit and here we're going to say
[55:47] something a bit simpler
[55:50] uh it's just gonna try a bit harder to
[55:51] make sure to pick your workout Avatar
[55:53] 30 and level up
[56:06] because anyway I think my comment is
[56:08] already a good summary of what the app
[56:10] does
[56:12] and I understand people won't
[56:13] necessarily read all that
[56:17] um
[56:32] even we can even do something like this
[56:42] right I'm gonna have a three minutes
[56:45] break to brush my teeth
[56:47] it's always good to launch with the
[56:49] fresh
[56:50] tea
[56:53] I can give you my base my best smile
[56:58] um okay three minutes let's go
[61:35] we are
[61:37] hello again YouTube uh well teeth are
[61:41] brushed and I think it's time to bust
[61:43] this
[61:49] View
[61:52] send it
[61:55] okay
[61:57] all right
[61:58] I have no idea where the Tweet has gone
[62:04] come on Twitter show me something
[62:08] okay there we go
[62:10] all right I'm gonna put this in here
[62:12] um I'm gonna pin it
[62:15] I'm gonna copy the link
[62:20] all right I uh I'm sharing the Tweet
[62:23] like a minute or two earlier uh because
[62:24] sometimes
[62:25] you know it doesn't go through
[62:28] um
[62:30] it's uh I would if if you guys are uh
[62:33] tuning in I would love your supports
[62:36] uh
[62:39] and um oh yeah I think I'll forget
[62:41] something I forget the little thing
[62:43] which is I need to update
[62:46] the links in my description
[62:49] um
[62:50] and have to remove something so this is
[62:53] not new
[62:55] this here will be new
[62:57] dream
[63:00] which one are we going to remove maybe
[63:02] we remove
[63:04] books calculator because it's a lot of
[63:06] characters is it
[63:08] hero
[63:11] the herofeed.com I think
[63:14] I don't even know
[63:18] the hero what is the name of it the hero
[63:21] feed that app uh seriously world
[63:24] uh gamify list is quite uh cool which
[63:28] one can we remove or add in here
[63:30] decision game maybe
[63:33] it has no purpose
[63:45] Maybe
[63:54] calculator
[64:08] the hero feed that
[64:13] right do you think it will be an issue
[64:15] with the Rocks video maybe if you get 30
[64:17] and wanted to put it down bro if that
[64:20] happens uh I think I will be on the top
[64:23] of the world really
[64:24] I mean
[64:26] I don't know I just I feel it could be
[64:28] oh it's live guys if you wanna if you
[64:30] want to go on product tense uh I'd love
[64:32] your support and if the rock finds it
[64:35] and then I don't know it's like I'll be
[64:37] the guy who got fired by Tai Lopez and
[64:39] the guy who got sued by The Rock
[64:41] I um I couldn't live with that
[64:47] um checking just the links are working
[64:48] that I didn't [Â __Â ] up something
[64:54] we are live
[64:57] okay
[65:03] all right there we go
[65:06] it's always exciting when it's uh like
[65:10] this
[65:11] um
[65:13] I'm gonna ask the family group
[65:18] Mom and Dad if you see this you are live
[65:21] on YouTube
[65:27] French typing for a second
[65:49] little hearts
[66:19] ad used for celebration elements on the
[66:21] landing page uh I use hey yo Max hey
[66:25] everybody cool to have you here you're
[66:26] the the guy who initiated me to uh
[66:29] originally twitch
[66:33] yes I want to hear you say that I want
[66:37] to hear your accent
[66:41] the library I use for the companies if
[66:43] that's the what you're asking it's
[66:45] called canvas company
[66:52] oops
[66:55] all right this is what happens when you
[66:57] have a friend that's a new uh news and
[67:00] stuff all the time and he leaks on
[67:01] Twitter on YouTube
[67:03] and saying that we'll get some Replay in
[67:06] the
[67:08] oh my god what have I done that
[67:10] right anyway that doesn't matter at all
[67:13] um
[67:15] yeah I think that's good
[67:18] yeah I'm gonna get banned bro I'm gonna
[67:19] get back because the that person who
[67:21] actually sent me this kind of content is
[67:23] uh
[67:27] I'm gonna get canceled
[67:33] but anyway that's the purpose of the
[67:34] live stream is like it's a fully
[67:36] transparent and um you know everything
[67:38] that happens
[67:42] um
[67:43] very good
[67:47] okay now we're gonna probably write a
[67:49] little something for Indie hikers
[67:52] yeah also these two
[68:28] um
[68:43] man I'll dream about this
[68:47] I've been coding and most of my code can
[68:51] be public it's okay but the API keys I
[68:54] use that someone could steal and you
[68:56] know run it under my name and just
[68:58] increase my billing or whatever just
[69:00] [Â __Â ] up my server
[69:01] I've been I leaked them a couple times
[69:03] in the Stream and so I have to turn off
[69:06] the stream and then I have to update all
[69:08] the variables like all the stuff in my
[69:11] code and then I can restart the it's
[69:12] just so annoying it'll be so nice man
[69:22] Legend
[69:29] okay
[69:33] yeah
[69:36] yeah it's really amazing
[69:41] yeah
[69:43] yeah it's another french guy in Bali
[69:46] seems like a
[69:48] an invasion
[69:54] how are we gonna call that
[70:07] [Laughter]
[70:14] even one would be too much complaining
[70:16] all the time
[70:20] I know
[70:21] we're live okay
[70:24] smart
[70:27] here I guess I have to go first
[71:01] you passed oh maybe I can reuse
[71:03] something I've made
[71:09] uh
[71:25] pretty good if you didn't stream that
[71:26] long ago
[71:28] yeah yeah yeah I won't complain here I
[71:31] think
[71:32] um
[71:34] I don't know I think it's I think most
[71:37] people who are subscribed to my channel
[71:39] are from Twitter
[71:42] so I don't I don't you know I think if I
[71:44] would be on tweet for instance some
[71:46] people would discover me through twitch
[71:47] I see YouTube lives as an extension of
[71:51] my Twitter more than a new platform

[74:47] which are you iOS or Android user
[75:15] hello buddies
[75:16] [Music]
[75:16] um
[75:18] able to come here
[76:29] Rich mad genius
[76:34] foreign
[77:09] yeah
[77:10] something I discovered really weird for
[77:12] uh anyone who wants some weird anecdotes
[77:15] and the French fry emoji
[77:18] at least on iOS has an embedded
[77:21] Emoji inside of it
[77:24] there's I have no idea why this is here
[77:26] but there's an emoji on top of it
[77:28] oh
[77:30] this is the daily anecdote
[77:32] you're gonna you'll go to bed tonight
[77:34] and you'll sleep smarter
[77:38] all right what did we write for Indie
[77:40] hackers uh
[77:44] so weird
[77:46] activity
[77:49] that worked
[77:52] okay any actors
[77:59] what are we going to say uh
[78:07] accountable
[78:10] to hold your friends accountable without
[78:12] breaking
[78:19] um
[78:20] I don't know whenever this is done so on
[78:23] the list we have uh
[78:26] those things that needs to be done so
[78:28] launch on Twitter is pretty much done
[78:30] uh the product hunts
[78:33] uh
[78:34] it's have done because I want to launch
[78:36] as well just a uh in the community and
[78:40] prioritan just as opposed
[78:43] um a same I have to write something for
[78:44] Indie hackers I'm gonna try Hacker News
[78:46] by using some picky words see if
[78:48] something works and I'm gonna end up
[78:51] with the subreddit I think this one side
[78:53] projects will be probably the go to
[78:57] um then whenever this is done
[78:59] I think we can move them unless
[79:01] something interesting happens unless the
[79:03] rock is suddenly suing me and uh you
[79:06] know there's some crunch
[79:08] that's worth streaming I think I'm gonna
[79:11] stop when I'm done with those platforms
[79:13] right the right
[79:18] yeah bro it's it's this like for the
[79:20] judge I want to use chat GPT but it's
[79:22] just I I don't have credits anymore and
[79:25] I need to update my credit card
[79:28] and so I'm I'm uh I'm gonna jump into
[79:30] some AI projects after but I need to
[79:33] I'll just I'll finish write it by hand
[79:35] now
[79:36] you know because I'm not really good
[79:37] with HPT for now
[79:40] well that could be fun I think
[79:45] I'm gonna yeah
[79:46] let's try to finish this
[79:54] wow
[79:57] oh wow that's nice okay
[80:00] but I don't know do you think
[80:04] maybe for something like which is a blog
[80:06] post about you know health tips or a
[80:09] tech article or something but for
[80:11] something that is really here I'm going
[80:13] to write something that is really a case
[80:15] study like I'm going to talk about what
[80:17] we did in the live
[80:19] add some details and stuff I don't know
[80:21] if how could it well for this so I'm
[80:25] kind of uh it's a personal experience
[80:28] I don't know if yeah because I mean what
[80:31] you think but I feel like it's something
[80:32] very uh it's just it's in my head and I
[80:34] don't know how GPT would actually
[80:36] write as well but if I don't try I'll
[80:37] never know so
[80:39] how she shut my mouth
[80:43] um
[80:47] right think think
[81:00] about how we doing

[81:07] save kids
[81:09] AI

[105:12] maybe not where but just stream
[105:14] streaming
[105:19] it's also demonstrative if you're still
[105:21] with my code in Louisiana
[105:24] even if only one percent money watching
[105:26] in Kent
[105:27] and nuts
[105:29] don't show up or pinch Netflix
[105:47] already

[106:25] appreciate it
[106:27] has been built
[106:28] capacitor exactly
[106:32] all right I think we can preview and
[106:35] eventually share that
[106:37] that worked
[106:39] the hackers two weeks ago I said
[106:40] streaming my screen on YouTube
[106:46] seven days it was stressful at first
[106:50] um I thought no one would train in this
[106:52] room would be boring your way because
[106:53] you start streaming the uh was available
[106:55] now certainly in the web
[106:58] also trans behavior in the app even
[107:01] though if only one person is barely
[107:02] watching you you cannot show not show up
[107:04] or you can't not show
[107:06] or finish Netflix
[107:08] show again present equal productivity
[107:12] what is your weird piece
[107:15] all right I think we can go with this
[107:18] there'll be more videos
[107:20] um
[107:21] maybe yeah probably it was fun for me uh
[107:25] if it was fun for you too I can redo it
[107:27] again yeah
[107:30] basically share that thing
[107:37] all right
[107:39] it's probably for you uh
[107:43] been watching the live uh this is not
[107:46] something new so it might be boring or
[107:49] anything but if you guys want to read a
[107:51] very short summary of
[107:54] um what happened
[107:55] I try to share something on product on
[107:58] India hackers
[108:00] all right but yeah I think I'm gonna do
[108:01] it again then
[108:03] um
[108:05] yeah I probably it's uh I need you know
[108:08] I
[108:09] I need to put on clothes I need to have
[108:12] a few things where you know it change a
[108:14] little bit my daily routine so I'm not
[108:15] going to do it forever startups but I
[108:17] think I'm I'm gonna stick to something
[108:19] where
[108:20] I try to do it once a month
[108:23] and and yeah yeah
[108:29] do we have anything to do this maybe we
[108:31] had a little picture it could be fun
[108:34] a picture would work oh I think yeah
[108:37] this one
[108:40] Now give me the link Twitter
[108:42] supposed to be my picture
[108:44] give it back to me
[108:48] um

[109:29] didn't know I could do that there
[109:31] incor I think it looks like this is
[109:34] still working so I'm gonna give it a try
[109:36] here's uh let me get you
[109:39] arm down images
[109:52] I hope the picture

[110:32] all right that'll do it doesn't matter
[110:39] and uh yeah perfect I look stupid
[110:42] this is exactly how it's in reality so
[110:47] usually I train um
[110:51] I feel like this part of protectant
[110:55] um I don't know if it's new or anything
[110:56] but recently I've used it to share
[111:00] what I usually like it's a small
[111:02] community so the text you I write for
[111:04] Indie hackers usually fits well in there
[111:06] I change a couple words and I get good
[111:08] feedbacks from people and it looks like
[111:09] there is a difference in audience
[111:12] so I get different kind of feedbacks as
[111:13] well so
[111:15] I'm gonna try as well to post it
[111:17] somewhere here
[111:20] and I'm going to say a word breaker
[111:23] that worked
[111:26] the hunters
[111:37] yeah yeah 100 percent
[111:39] so maybe yeah you're right maybe I need
[111:41] to change a little bit my wording

[121:36] uh
[121:37] but yeah as you can see like it's oh
[121:40] really old or nothing it's it's hard to
[121:42] get just a little bit of traction
[121:44] uh then nothing nothing nothing nothing
[121:46] nothing I think this one for habits
[121:48] Garden here
[121:50] uh same it went kind of crazy I get
[121:53] better feedbacks because the ABS was a
[121:55] bit more I don't know techy or something
[121:59] procrastination and and then nothing
[122:01] nothing nothing nothing nothing and
[122:04] right now this one is a little bit
[122:07] I know yeah
[122:10] let's see if I can use good something uh
[122:15] why are you giving
[122:19] do they oh no [Â __Â ] I [Â __Â ] up
[122:22] no no it's not a show Market it's a show
[122:24] I can use [Â __Â ]
[122:28] or maybe I can
[122:30] show
[122:34] oh [Â __Â ] I think I [Â __Â ] up
[122:50] why do you add extra capital letters
[122:54] okay we find a habit tracker let's see
[122:57] if that works better okay
[123:04] okay now it's in the void
[123:07] this is gonna disappear
[123:10] okay it's somewhere here okay if you uh
[123:13] if you want to uh send some support on
[123:15] how can you think
[123:17] um it's uh in the show Hacker News and
[123:20] then in the new West category at the top
[123:24] uh I did the mistake uh what was like
[123:27] maybe a year ago I shared my hiker news
[123:30] link with friends
[123:32] um asking them kindly to a vote if they
[123:34] want to support
[123:35] and I got banned and I I I'm thinking
[123:39] that unlike products where you can share
[123:41] direct link to your products on hiker
[123:43] news if they got incoming traffic
[123:45] directly on the product so the slash so
[123:48] here I get a you or else specifically
[123:50] for this
[123:52] if they get too many incoming links from
[123:55] this I think you get banned
[123:58] or at least the post get deleted or
[124:00] something and this is what happened for
[124:01] my previous product
[124:03] uh so I'm not sharing any hiker news
[124:06] link anymore just like hoping somehow it
[124:08] will get some some traction
[124:11] uh because yeah because I could Bend
[124:14] this is it
[124:16] somebody who has no followers and they
[124:17] were being started I can reach target
[124:19] audience
[124:21] I think I mean you even though you don't
[124:24] have a node I mean you we all start with
[124:26] own an audience
[124:27] and to create your audience you will
[124:29] have to find something that people are
[124:31] interested in
[124:33] um so obviously if you're launching
[124:34] startup there's a massive ecosystem on
[124:36] Twitter
[124:37] that you know if you keep showing that
[124:39] you're making progress and you're
[124:40] launching and everything people will
[124:42] start to follow you
[124:43] uh and then you'll get an urgent so
[124:45] you're investing for the future
[124:47] and and I think even though you don't
[124:50] have an audience I think it's
[124:52] um you could if you you could you could
[124:55] get some traction Anyway by launching a
[124:57] different platforms so you find the
[124:58] right subreddits uh you try Hacker News
[125:01] you saw like a my account news account
[125:02] had zero karmas or anything and then the
[125:06] first post I made I suddenly got a bunch
[125:08] of comments in our votes
[125:11] you can try subreddits um you can try
[125:14] Twitter with the building public hashtag
[125:18] um obviously product is a big deal if
[125:20] you have a good app whether you have an
[125:21] audience or not you can still get some
[125:23] traffic
[125:24] um and in the hackers is a nice one too
[125:27] it's probably where I would I would
[125:28] start either levels has made a good book
[125:31] about that if you want to check it out
[125:33] the bug is basically
[125:36] talking about the different platforms
[125:37] you can launch on
[125:40] um
[125:40] and here are the ones I'm trying to do
[125:42] so we have done I can use and now we
[125:44] need to prepare a little video for
[125:45] Reddit
[125:47] um and for Reddit so if
[125:50] uh if you were in the previous live you
[125:54] know that when I turn on my VPN
[125:56] sometimes the life gets shut down which
[125:59] I don't really want right now so
[126:02] I can't show you
[126:04] but there is a subreddit called side
[126:06] project that is actually really nice and
[126:08] people are cheerful and everything
[126:11] and you need to make a product demo
[126:12] video that's how they uh
[126:17] they're structure uh so I I will need to
[126:20] make one from scratch just because last
[126:23] time they didn't really like when I made
[126:25] a fun video they really want to see like
[126:27] pictures and stuff
[126:29] so this is what I'm going to do now
[126:36] and I'm going to turn on my VPN at the
[126:38] last uh time of the Stream
[126:41] so I hope you see eventually we don't
[126:43] get canceled from YouTube and I can keep
[126:46] this live running as long as I can
[126:53] get projects
[127:06] what was the answer to that question
[127:10] thinking about the Thomas question
[127:23] um well I think first we we all started
[127:26] with on an audience and this is
[127:27] perfectly normal uh I think the more you
[127:29] launch the more you will have an
[127:30] audience so usually the first I don't
[127:32] want to say the first launch are kind of
[127:34] a
[127:35] um
[127:36] pointless but uh you know it's it's just
[127:39] gonna keep getting better and better and
[127:40] better
[127:42] and also uh I think the typical
[127:45] perhaps like how can you use India
[127:47] hackers and Twitter if you try them all
[127:49] you and you have a product that is
[127:51] interesting you might get some
[127:53] be back somewhere at some point
[127:56] um as an example when I I just started
[127:58] the Indie hiking journey I had no idea
[128:01] I've never launched on hiker news and I
[128:03] made something and for some reason it
[128:06] went viral and I get 10 000 visitors for
[128:09] these little sites it's a movie
[128:11] recommendation stuff
[128:13] and I had no followers no one like
[128:16] nobody was following a maybe like 20
[128:18] Twitter followers or something and and
[128:20] these create some traction that you can
[128:22] share on Twitter and people like oh
[128:23] who's this guy who get traffic on hiker
[128:25] news and I think you have to try a lot
[128:27] of things
[128:28] and something will stick more than
[128:30] others and this will create a loop of
[128:32] like a positive
[128:40] if you want make sure the separated so
[128:43] it's actually it's actually pretty big
[128:44] I'm looking at it on my phone now it's
[128:46] like 110 000 users I think 106
[128:52] 000 members
[128:53] it's a pretty big one
[128:57] it's a pretty big one and usually unlike
[129:00] Hacker News this one is if if you're
[129:02] making if you make something cool you
[129:04] always find some traction somehow like
[129:07] it's unusual that a launched there and I
[129:10] get zero feedback usually some people
[129:12] see it
[129:16] and it's probably one of the only
[129:18] subreddits you can share uh something
[129:20] that people have to pay for like uh like
[129:22] a proper startup uh without getting uh
[129:25] canceled
[129:27] where are we on product tense um
[129:30] a little refresh we're number two way
[129:32] we're still number two
[129:34] oh wow there's no AI there's no AI guy
[129:38] today so we gotta I mean for now I don't
[129:41] see any AI oh we have an AI product oh
[129:43] that's good that's generous and mobile
[129:45] GPT
[129:46] those two are dangerous I think uh
[129:50] I guess it's pretty cool well I've never
[129:53] I never expected the product somehow to
[129:55] be number two
[129:57] [Â __Â ] I think yeah wow super cool
[130:04] this is good but yeah yeah
[130:06] I mean I feel like Reddit is either you
[130:09] have a really Niche products like you're
[130:11] doing some really like specific Niche
[130:13] stuff for developers or whatever then
[130:14] maybe they're low product promotion
[130:17] but besides I feel it's really hard to
[130:19] promote something on Reddit and I feel
[130:22] side project that subreddit is an
[130:24] exception to them
[130:26] open Gmail
[130:28] oh yeah oh that's cool
[130:31] we have uh We've made a nice uh oh wow
[130:35] [Â __Â ] sexy like already I was super cool
[130:38] oh [Â __Â ] that's nice we launched an hour
[130:41] ago oh that's nice
[131:14] I'll do it sir
[132:14] HC
[132:19] who are you Natasha and you are here
[132:23] okay this is awesome thank you buddy
[132:27] you guys are so kind this is crazy I
[132:30] don't know if that's something you guys
[132:31] experienced too uh my friends who are
[132:34] not indie hikers who are not
[132:35] entrepreneurs
[132:37] they hate Twitter they say this is a
[132:39] terrible platform they say people are
[132:41] angry all the time talking about
[132:42] politics and everything and this is fun
[132:45] because I think we are a small ecosystem
[132:47] in that Twitter part and we don't I
[132:50] personally I don't follow other accounts
[132:52] that
[132:52] Indie hiker stuff and I don't see what
[132:55] my friends are talking about and it
[132:57] creates some kind of like a gap where
[132:59] they're like Twitter is horrible it's
[133:00] politics and people are angry and I'm
[133:01] like no people are just so kind like
[133:04] people are just so kind on Twitter it's
[133:06] crazy and I'm like what's what's
[133:07] actually going on
[133:10] is what treaty
[133:13] it is but creating your experience
[133:45] oh wow we get a like on The Hacker News
[133:47] it's possible
[133:49] it's probably one of you in the industry
[133:54] if you see things you don't like you can
[133:55] do then follow oh that's true yeah
[133:56] that's true that's true
[134:03] I think but do you think it's true do
[134:05] you
[134:08] think do you think there are other
[134:10] communities like because I feel like
[134:12] building public Community or just India
[134:14] actors or entrepreneurs in general the
[134:15] community I feel like it's quite big
[134:18] you think there are other communities
[134:19] like this that are very cheerful and and
[134:21] supportive of each other
[134:42] for December I agree with you man I
[134:45] agree I have also a positive vision of
[134:46] it

[143:54] uh
[143:56] yeah well Reddit is one of the things
[143:58] that I'm the most surprised it's been
[144:00] porn it's been
[144:02] I don't say I understand but it's on the
[144:05] scale of you know things that can be
[144:07] banned in notes I feel like
[144:08] porn would be first
[144:10] but the Reddit seriously and in that
[144:13] case you also ban Twitter and social
[144:15] media
[144:21] yeah
[144:22] Google secured it perfect
[144:27] the workout Avatar

[145:17] two
[145:19] it's for me hey
[145:22] Green live on YouTube
[145:43] um
[145:53] that's a weird thought that I had but I
[145:56] feel like
[145:58] the feed your YouTube feed is something
[146:01] that is very private
[146:03] I just random thought
[146:06] you could you could oh in other words
[146:08] you could
[146:10] show me your YouTube feed and I will
[146:12] tell you who you are I have a feeling
[146:13] that it tells a lot about a person
[146:17] it says a lot
[146:20] and to be frank
[146:23] I feel I would feel a little bit shy
[146:25] showing my I mean I can't say that I'm
[146:27] Live on YouTube but
[146:30] I don't know yet I feel like it's
[146:31] probably it's a little bit of a private
[146:33] thing for some reason
[146:36] you personally feel different
[146:42] yeah I mean I try to
[146:46] you know like just take it easy and like
[146:48] whatever you know you guys are here in
[146:50] my apartment so somehow I have nothing
[146:52] really to hide so okay this is my
[146:54] YouTube feed you know like this is who I
[146:55] am
[146:57] uh just as a general quote I feel like
[146:59] you could stick if someone would show me
[147:01] his or her YouTube feed I would I would
[147:03] be able to say what kind of what kind of
[147:05] attack I would be able to guess or make
[147:06] some
[147:08] guess a few things about the person it's
[147:10] a very uh
[147:12] some kind somehow in Syria digital
[147:15] identity it's pretty fun

[154:28] place
[154:36] okay we have the video for Reddit
[154:38] uh let's see how can use I can use avoid
[154:43] what do we have in the hackers

[156:47] I think where's my watch okay
[156:52] oh
[156:56] all right yeah that's interesting so
[157:01] so and do you have apps that
[157:04] so your watch track the data and the
[157:07] data are sent to the app
[157:08] and on your app you can for instance see
[157:11] some charts datas and things
[157:14] so it means like if I were to build hero
[157:17] feeds okay for so if I build hero feed
[157:20] potentially
[157:22] the data that it will be connected to
[157:24] your Apple Health app
[157:26] and then it says like oh Maxwell has
[157:28] done its workout today and it will
[157:31] complete automatically for you or
[157:33] something
[158:01] pwa
[158:03] could be could be could be
[158:06] absolutely
[158:09] going somewhere linked travels okay
[158:11] all right I think if I yeah if I want to
[158:13] go I'll see how people react to these
[158:16] uh tracker
[158:19] and um
[158:20] yeah we'll see we'll see if he you know
[158:23] is like a in the end uh if people seems
[158:27] to like it and come back and create
[158:28] avatars we could I could definitely
[158:31] consider getting deeper into this
[158:33] connected to
[158:36] to Mr Apple Health
[158:38] um I have a little stripe here that'll
[158:39] be I would actually haven't talked about
[158:41] it but I think I have absolutely no
[158:43] um expectation for this app
[158:46] uh but obviously if we could get I don't
[158:49] know if we there's a premium version so
[158:51] if the app would make something like 100
[158:53] during the launch day that would be
[158:55] super freaking dope
[158:57] uh and I think that's kind of like the
[159:00] decider whether I would keep working on
[159:02] the product or not that's pretty much
[159:04] what I usually do is I launch I see and
[159:07] if there is some kind of like
[159:10] positive success where you know people
[159:11] are willing to pay for it at a point
[159:13] where I'm like okay if I work on it more
[159:16] maybe it could work then I keep going on
[159:17] the app and if not I'll just leave the
[159:19] app as it is and people can still enjoy
[159:21] it now let's move on to the next one
[159:27] and it will be a new channel for me too
[159:29] yeah that's three yeah 100 percent
[159:36] nature sounds wide sleeping and handle
[159:39] [Laughter]
[159:41] sleeping handle what is endo
[159:46] oh
[159:48] how much page views uh you know what
[159:50] this is it it's it's a the dashboard is
[159:53] public if you want to have a look we are
[159:55] a current visitors and
[159:59] um usually it's pretty slow we have a
[160:01] Nike bump with the launch of and yeah
[160:04] 170 visitors today
[160:06] what would be interesting is to see how
[160:08] many people signed up uh 14 people
[160:10] signed up
[160:13] with endo
[160:16] oh wow
[160:25] landing page

[171:27] if um someone in the live likes to share
[171:31] on Reddit
[171:32] uh these subreddits I usually post on
[171:35] the as a video because uh that's what
[171:38] they ask they ask a video that promotes
[171:39] your ad that shows how your app is used
[171:42] uh the other time I try to share the
[171:45] video where which was like a fun video
[171:46] like The Joe Rogan video it didn't do
[171:49] well at all like someone actually told
[171:51] me to delete the video uh I think you
[171:54] just screencast to your product and use
[171:56] and that's what people want to see

[176:35] notification with that okay
[176:43] it's actually yeah it's actually here I
[176:45] gave my habit tracker exercise to grow
[176:47] your workout Avatar
[176:53] okay I think we are all done for the
[176:56] platforms we wanted to launch on
[177:01] separate it's
[177:03] in The Hacker News product and India
[177:06] hacker
[177:08] yeah or maybe because I love Indie
[177:10] hikers I might create a product page for
[177:13] this
[177:28] yeah here we go let's go to products row
[177:32] it
[177:33] maybe fine
[177:37] Fitness
[177:39] dimified
[177:43] Fitness tracker
[177:49] boom
[177:52] I guess we'll need a little logo
[178:01] Sports
[178:08] Revenue
[178:10] I can connect to a stripe actually that
[178:12] can be fun please try belows me I think
[178:15] it's a value of the product page uh
[178:17] honestly man almost zero
[178:20] I think I love Indie hacker but
[178:24] product pages I don't know
[178:26] I haven't I haven't seen any relevance
[178:32] um data or anything wait give me a
[178:34] second and just just in case I don't
[178:35] want to leak my password
[178:37] I'm gonna show you my stupid face in the
[178:39] meantime
[178:54] and there we go
[178:57] visitors yep connecting to stripe yay
[179:01] one dollar per month a tracking link to
[179:04] see
[179:05] there you go oh yeah I could I could
[179:07] actually put a ref that's a good point
[179:10] um let me see if I can ah it's too late
[179:12] maybe I know I can do it here
[179:14] pretty cool but actually I have a link
[179:16] no I my
[179:19] um
[179:20] analytics dashboard normally showed me
[179:23] where is it here but maybe I can check
[179:25] for other apps so for instance 50 hacks
[179:27] we look at hold time I
[179:29] and we can check
[179:31] in the hacker somewhere
[179:34] Indie hackers
[179:38] so this is because I launched and this
[179:41] is the traffic I get from India hackers
[179:42] and as you can see it's like it's
[179:45] ridiculous
[179:46] I don't think the spikes here are launch
[179:49] purely because I made a post the posts
[179:51] are actually working well people I think
[179:52] read
[179:54] actually you can see here the post that
[179:56] I made but just the rest of that is like
[179:59] of one visitor in February in zero in
[180:02] March so I guess pretty useless
[180:05] which makes me think like
[180:09] why am I feeling this right now
[180:12] and I think I need to close my mind I
[180:14] need to like yeah okay I've done all I
[180:16] could for that app and you know let's
[180:18] see
[180:18] uh let's see
[180:21] what kind of clearness how does it exist
[180:23] um
[180:34] let's workout suffers
[180:42] handle no or dates March 1123
[180:48] your modes Founders Thunder code to
[180:51] solve the [Â __Â ]
[180:57] Commission
[180:59] funding
[181:02] of funded bootstraps
[181:06] my projects
[181:09] injury iOS
[181:12] it's actually everywhere
[181:16] uh health
[181:29] activities
[181:31] remembering any hacker never
[181:38] but that's all of the links not
[181:40] specifically
[181:41] yeah yeah
[181:43] but yeah
[181:44] yeah I mean yeah you're right which
[181:46] which means
[181:48] if in total I get like two visitors a
[181:50] month from all the links so maybe some
[181:53] of them are coming from the post which
[181:54] means like the probably the product
[181:55] isn't
[181:56] making actually the product page
[181:58] probably isn't making any traffic at all
[182:02] and maybe you would make if you know the
[182:05] app was big and it would have like a a
[182:08] huge connection like a stripe
[182:11] um
[182:13] like a lot of revenue from stripe and
[182:15] maybe somehow would appear somewhere
[182:16] maybe we can check the home page maybe
[182:19] or any actors let's see
[182:21] yeah no there's no there's not even a
[182:23] product here that's been shared
[182:26] if you click on someone's profile does
[182:29] it go
[182:35] yeah
[182:37] yeah you see it from the person's
[182:40] profile
[182:44] here
[182:46] not convinced but anyway I don't know
[182:48] just for the record for some somehow
[182:51] it's kind of my identity I would say to
[182:53] it's like I feel like any Hacker's
[182:55] profile is the profile that is most
[182:58] likely mine
[183:00] it's a kind of like a tweeter but a
[183:01] deeper Twitter
[183:04] so uh I just filled it in uh maybe I
[183:07] could show it to my kids in 20 years or
[183:09] something
[183:16] add or delete post examples here that's
[183:19] the annoying part I feel I don't you
[183:22] have to write something
[183:25] and to delete like I have to do this
[183:27] every time I press three buttons to
[183:30] delete
[183:31] those four or five posts in
[183:36] and I have to write something that has
[183:37] more than x y z characters I just find
[183:40] this a little bit annoying
[183:44] I'm not saying it and I think
[183:51] I use yes yeah I agreement I agree Max
[183:53] I'm with you right
[183:55] I feel like he doesn't incorporate well
[183:58] somewhere because uh I feel like the
[184:00] these is actually me you know like the
[184:02] profile page is like it's you see my
[184:04] product this is what I do every time and
[184:06] I wish sometimes like it would be
[184:08] displayed somewhere
[184:10] like I think they do that a little bit
[184:12] on product numbers like somewhere you
[184:14] know like here he would say something
[184:16] like
[184:17] and then buy products or just something
[184:20] that shows like this guy has built this
[184:21] product just just a bit more highlighted
[184:28] I started a couple helpful shows
[184:33] that we need
[184:37] like confessions
[184:41] um
[184:42] it's live
[184:46] uh and then I'm just gonna copy what I
[184:49] wrote for
[184:51] Indie hackers probably
[184:56] yeah I'm gonna just copy that thing
[185:07] [Music]
[185:20] wait for your patch to be uploaded and I
[185:21] think the logo didn't go through
[185:26] I tried again
[185:31] all right no flying chosen I think I'm
[185:34] gonna check this later I think they
[185:35] might have issued with it
[185:42] maybe we do a little inspection Network
[185:50] all right [Â __Â ] it that's bored uh
[185:53] that'll do it
[185:55] I can use is an absolutely chaos
[185:59] Reddit is uh not showing up anything at
[186:02] first

[208:01] foreign
[208:17] normally when I go they have so much
[208:19] more things to talk about but um
[208:23] I'm feeling like the live I don't know
[208:25] if I should keep streaming because uh
[208:28] you guys have uh every
[208:31] every subject I've pretty much done
[208:33] everything this is what I do normally in
[208:35] a stream
[208:36] um and then I say you're on a computer
[208:38] making sure
[208:39] I don't receive messages like someone
[208:41] says the app has a bug or
[208:44] or I reply to comments and things but
[208:46] it's nothing uh no no magic
[208:56] cut them in
[209:03] do we get some feedback somewhere in
[209:04] there

[209:10] good day for uh canopy

[209:19] wish you a best of languages
[209:53] supposed to do that

[210:23] do we get something here
[210:31] Reddit UI
[210:33] they tell you that the video has been
[210:36] promoted processed successfully and they
[210:38] give you like a bright red message that
[210:40] looks like a something is wrong
[210:45] good to nobody
[210:51] dude
