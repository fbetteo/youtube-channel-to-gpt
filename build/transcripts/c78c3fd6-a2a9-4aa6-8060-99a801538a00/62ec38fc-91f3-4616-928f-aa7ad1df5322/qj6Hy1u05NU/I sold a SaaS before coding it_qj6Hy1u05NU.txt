[00:00] in 2018 I made a call from Japan to a
[00:02] business in the United States and I sold
[00:04] them a software that I did not create
[00:06] that's how I made my first internet
[00:08] dollar and that's how I built a software
[00:09] business that lasted for 5 years and
[00:11] made almost six figures in revenue and
[00:13] is still paying the bills today even
[00:14] though I abandoned it for years ago hey
[00:17] I'm Mark I am a son entrepreneur and I
[00:18] built small internet businesses that are
[00:20] now making $50,000 a month in Revenue at
[00:22] 90% profit with zero employee in this
[00:25] video I'm going to break down how I
[00:26] created my software without knowing how
[00:27] to code how I grew it and what's going
[00:29] on to in 2018 I moved to s South Korea I
[00:33] was there because an high school friend
[00:35] of mine was already there and managed to
[00:37] get $11,000 uh an investment from Angel
[00:40] Investors and he offered me to become
[00:42] the co-founder we created an AI startup
[00:44] and we hired two employees in the little
[00:46] office in the middle of s and we were
[00:48] trying to predict the the price of
[00:50] flight tickets uh we felt miserably we
[00:52] couldn't deliver anything valuable um
[00:55] but it was a very interesting experience
[00:56] because I learned something about me
[00:58] which is I want to to be 100% free I
[01:01] don't want employee I don't want
[01:02] investors I want to work on my own
[01:04] little project and so after we moved on
[01:06] I had zero income uh and no savings so I
[01:09] started to do some side gigs where I
[01:12] would go in movies uh as a actor in the
[01:14] background uh they would pay $200 uh a
[01:17] day for like 12 to 14 hours of acting I
[01:20] wouldn't do much uh I would just get
[01:21] some makeup and and get paid at the end
[01:23] of the day I would have one gig a week
[01:26] which would pay just enough for me to be
[01:28] able to leave and eat in s South Korea I
[01:31] started to brainstorm on Startup ID uh
[01:35] that I could work of on just by myself
[01:37] so I would go to this little uh
[01:38] co-working space in the basement near my
[01:40] house they would provide free coffee and
[01:42] free snacks which was really good at the
[01:43] time uh back then in 2018 uh messenger
[01:47] uh and WhatsApp Bots were very popular
[01:49] so basically it's uh automated replies
[01:52] from a business that can chat with a
[01:54] customer to help them uh I've been a
[01:56] gamer my entire life uh so I thought why
[01:59] not having some kind of game on
[02:00] messenger or Whatsapp that could
[02:02] entertain potential customers give them
[02:04] a discount coupon if they succeed at the
[02:06] game so that the business could grow and
[02:09] so I came up with this IDE of a
[02:11] messenger bot that would actually be an
[02:13] entire escape room so you would have a
[02:14] lot of puzzles and riddles uh that you
[02:16] could you can play and if you finish the
[02:18] game you get a discount coupon um back
[02:21] then it was just an IDE but now I have
[02:22] to show you the software uh so you have
[02:24] um a better understanding of what I had
[02:27] in mind so this is a customer of mine on
[02:29] the left side uh they would sign up on
[02:30] my website and then they will connect
[02:32] their Facebook page people will be able
[02:34] to play uh those games once the Facebook
[02:36] page is connected on messenger so the B
[02:39] here is automated it offers some rles
[02:40] and puzzles that people can click um if
[02:42] I want to play this game for instance
[02:44] the there you go you would have uh the
[02:47] the automated replies from the messenger
[02:50] Bots that will challenge you you earn
[02:51] some points and at the end if you get
[02:53] enough points you get a discount coupon
[02:54] for the skap room business uh I was a
[02:56] terrible programmer back then and I know
[02:59] we would would take sometimes to build
[03:01] something like this but luckily in my
[03:02] co-working space I made this guy on the
[03:04] right Andre which is a very um
[03:06] successful marketer and later became my
[03:09] friend and he told me then why don't you
[03:11] just build it before why don't you just
[03:13] sell it before you build it and uh I had
[03:16] nothing else much at the time uh it was
[03:18] very reliable so I was like oh why not
[03:20] let's give it a try so I started uh to
[03:23] send C emails to escape room businesses
[03:25] uh would say something like this I can
[03:27] help you get more traction or get more
[03:28] customers usually my code emails would
[03:31] be three lines um I would always add the
[03:33] name of the business owner at the top
[03:35] and try to explain a little bit how how
[03:37] this thing work um I sent those emails
[03:40] and I had to go to Japan for a Visa Run
[03:43] I had no money so I ended up in the
[03:45] cheapest and the tiniest uh room in OA
[03:49] Japan uh but I started to get some
[03:51] replies from those businesses and uh one
[03:54] of them wanted to get on the phone call
[03:56] with me and I uh did the call and this
[03:59] changed my entire life uh so I was in
[04:01] this room I was tired and uh the C was K
[04:04] for somewhere in the afternoon the Wi-Fi
[04:05] was bad so I had to go down in the
[04:06] living room it was really hot it was
[04:08] noisy there were people um I was I I was
[04:11] a terrible marketer and a terrible
[04:13] salesperson uh but I jump on the call
[04:15] and the call lasted for 42 minutes of
[04:17] cringiness and awkwardness and
[04:19] eventually at the end she said uh yes
[04:21] I'm in and uh she wanted to move on and
[04:24] get that uh messenger butt set up for
[04:26] her page and she asked for the payment
[04:28] page uh I sent her the link and she paid
[04:31] and eventually she turned uh just only
[04:33] recently 2023 after spending almost
[04:36] $5,000 on this messenger bot so that
[04:40] call entirely changed my life because it
[04:42] was my first dollar online and without
[04:43] knowing it after this first Fone call I
[04:46] made $5,000 I went back to Korea more
[04:49] motivated than ever I had paying
[04:51] customers and I had a product to build
[04:53] but I was a very bad programmer so I
[04:55] started to like find uh pieces of codes
[04:57] on YouTube and GitHub and try to
[04:59] assemble some product I would bring my
[05:01] computer everywhere um even when I would
[05:03] do some gigs and I would build in the
[05:04] bus eventually I ended up building a
[05:06] product that was working and I also made
[05:08] this little website with some U social
[05:11] proof and everything but I had no idea
[05:13] how to authenticate users like how to
[05:14] create a proper account so people would
[05:16] click here they would end up on a
[05:17] stright payment page they could pay and
[05:19] then they would have to fill a form that
[05:21] asked for their Facebook page and their
[05:22] email for contacting and I would
[05:23] manually have to set them up instead of
[05:26] logging them through Facebook and do it
[05:28] automatically um I started to get few
[05:30] more customers and because we had no
[05:32] reason to stay in South Korea we moved
[05:34] to Bal with my current girlfriend who
[05:37] later is now my wife um my days were
[05:40] would be really chill I would spend most
[05:42] of my time building I had a very um
[05:45] specific time schedule so I would surf
[05:46] in the morning and then I would come
[05:48] back and do marketing so I would do cold
[05:49] emails like I did in the past C worked
[05:51] and a little bit of Facebook ads I would
[05:53] also um try to take care of my health by
[05:55] doing some stretching and uh reading
[05:57] books and on the afternoon I would work
[05:59] on the product 90% of my customers would
[06:02] come from code emails and as a product
[06:05] guy I have no idea how to send good code
[06:07] emails so I follow this guy Alex who
[06:10] write about sending code emails that
[06:12] sell and I would take his templates
[06:14] personalize them for the industry I was
[06:16] in so ESC room businesses and I would
[06:19] add some variables like the business
[06:20] owner name and the business name uh then
[06:23] it was matter of getting uh leads and
[06:25] leads contact so I would go on trip
[06:26] advisor and type Escape rooms in CT and
[06:29] I would end up on their website and
[06:31] usually on their website of the business
[06:32] somewhere in here you would find the
[06:34] contact if you scroll you would get the
[06:36] email of the business a way to improve
[06:39] the conversion rate it's important to
[06:41] add the name of the person so the
[06:42] manager or the fer uh to make sure that
[06:45] it's personalized for that I would go
[06:46] back to Trip Advisor I would scroll
[06:48] through the review section and usually a
[06:50] member of the team or sometimes the
[06:52] funer would reply to comments of
[06:53] customers and add their name and
[06:55] sometimes even their business email I
[06:57] would just get that name here and I I
[06:59] would add all the information I
[07:00] collected to a sales pipeline it's
[07:03] basically a four stage pipeline um where
[07:05] I would per put the new contacts in here
[07:08] send them one C email if they don't rep
[07:10] I'll will send them another one 3 days
[07:11] later and on and on and on until I send
[07:13] four emails if some of the reply I would
[07:16] try to engage with them and get them on
[07:18] a zoom call uh back then in 20188 Zoom
[07:21] was not popular so it was quite hard but
[07:22] once they were on Zoom I knew that 60 to
[07:25] 70% chance they would subscribe for my
[07:27] services I would call col 10 new leads
[07:30] per day and I would send also 10 emails
[07:32] per day and in average I would get one
[07:34] to two reply and I would get one to two
[07:36] calls per week I would charge 199 per
[07:39] month for these messenger Bots but I was
[07:41] also experience some turn uh so I would
[07:43] I would get some customers and and some
[07:45] other customers would turn which would
[07:47] at the beginning uh make my Revenue
[07:48] around $1,000 to $1,500 per month so I
[07:52] started to experience with yearly
[07:54] membership I would say I would sell the
[07:56] bot for a discount for a yearly price at
[07:59] $2,000 and to my surprise some people
[08:02] actually paid I would get a sales
[08:04] notification from strip that says I
[08:05] received a $2,000 uh payment which was
[08:08] massive for me especially living in Bell
[08:10] where I would live with about less than
[08:12] $11,000 a month um the business the mini
[08:16] business started to grow a little bit I
[08:17] would have 10 to 15 customers at the
[08:19] time across uh the US the Europe and
[08:22] Australia and the business look uh like
[08:25] this uh C it was about $1,000 in 200 19
[08:29] and I would keep growing growing uh I
[08:31] started to implement annual annual
[08:33] payments here and eventually it ended up
[08:35] reaching $6,000 in monthly uh revenue
[08:39] and then covid happened in February 2021
[08:42] because of covid escape from businesses
[08:43] had to close their locations and I had
[08:45] two options either I was too greedy and
[08:47] I keept charging them uh the monthly
[08:49] recurring Revenue until they tell me hey
[08:51] stop or I just gave them service for
[08:53] free until someday they will be able to
[08:55] reopen which is what I did so they will
[08:57] I emailed the entire list of customers
[08:59] that I had and I uh told them like he
[09:01] I'm not going to collect any payments
[09:02] until things get better so obviously the
[09:04] revenue went to zero for 4 months as you
[09:07] can see here there's absolutely nothing
[09:09] um I was in Bal back then which uh I was
[09:12] pretty lucky because Co was not really
[09:13] bad and I could Surf and for some reason
[09:16] I felt disconnected from the business so
[09:18] I started a YouTube channel about surf
[09:20] just to keep me busy for a couple month
[09:22] trying to decide whether I'm going to
[09:23] keep working on this business later or
[09:25] not in August 2020 things started to
[09:30] reopen a bit so escape room businesses
[09:32] could open their doors and make some
[09:33] money u a lot of them had closed because
[09:36] of like they went bankrupt or they just
[09:38] you know business owners wanted to do
[09:40] something different uh so you can see
[09:41] here things started again not as crazy
[09:44] as they used to be uh but I didn't do
[09:46] any marketing and it was still paying
[09:48] customers from the previous year
[09:50] 2019 uh I would make 1.3 1.5k per month
[09:55] which is uh pretty good for here in Bal
[09:57] regarding the fact that I was not doing
[09:59] any marketing around this time with my
[10:01] wife we went back to France and we got
[10:03] married we eventually got stuck there
[10:05] and couldn't come back to Bal for about
[10:07] a year um things also went a little bit
[10:09] wrong in my life I got uh I think
[10:12] depressed and uh not in the right shoes
[10:15] so I decided to abandon the business
[10:17] completely uh of course customers would
[10:19] keep their uh service I had nothing to
[10:21] do to provide the service anyway cuz it
[10:23] was like an API I was just not doing any
[10:26] new marketing and andb boing new
[10:28] customers and eventually it's been four
[10:30] years since I haven't touched anything
[10:33] and you can see here the revenue is
[10:35] slowly shrinking and it will at some
[10:37] point to reach zero per month probably
[10:39] in 2024 and now recently one of my
[10:42] biggest customer turns bring the revenue
[10:44] down to $200 a month this year uh this
[10:47] was Alex uh they had two locations and
[10:50] this spend almost 13,000 us on uh my
[10:55] software which uh seems like crazy to me
[10:57] when I think I just got started with a
[10:59] couple of cold emails this is not a
[11:01] typical Silicon Valley unicorn fer this
[11:04] is just a random guy trying to make a
[11:05] living with its app in his bedroom this
[11:07] story led me to where I am today where I
[11:09] have all the freedom in the world where
[11:10] I can surf spend time with my family
[11:12] spend time with my wife and take care of
[11:14] my health anytime while also making
[11:15] $50,000 a month so whatever this is you
[11:18] have in mind just get started because
[11:20] you might be one C email away from
[11:21] closing a $5,000 client
