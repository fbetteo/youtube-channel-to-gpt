[00:31] there we go
[00:35] how long is the delay there we go
[00:39] that's pretty bad
[00:50] anyway I'll do it
[00:54] all right
[01:13] how long is the delay one more time
[01:19] how long is the delay one more time five
[01:21] seconds
[01:24] how long is the delay one more time five
[01:27] seconds
[01:34] that seems to be working
[01:41] do I know if I'm alone if there's
[01:43] someone in here
[01:49] [Music]
[01:55] there's someone in here I have no idea
[01:58] if there's someone watching or if it's
[02:00] just me alone
[02:06] um
[02:08] yes will you give me some stats oh there
[02:10] we go
[02:12] yo Twitter
[02:16] um I'm figuring it out quickly how OBS
[02:18] work give me a few minutes before we
[02:20] start I just need to understand what's
[02:22] actually going on
[02:23] um
[02:33] all right what are you guys Twitter
[02:34] names
[02:42] good evening oh yeah America
[02:48] oh nice hello everyone
[02:53] oh that's so cool it looks like we have
[02:54] everybody tuning in from different parts
[02:56] of the world
[02:58] it's morning time I'm based in Bali here
[03:00] so it's about 9 A.M for me
[03:03] I see good evening
[03:06] sweet
[03:09] let me know where you guys are
[03:11] in from which country
[03:31] oh yes there we go we got the whole
[03:33] world
[03:34] oh nice
[03:39] okay
[03:40] um let me think what we're gonna do so
[03:43] maybe we'll just wait a minute or two
[03:46] um to let if to let people a few times
[03:48] to join in and then
[03:50] um and it would be to let you guys
[03:53] choose which startup I'm going to build
[03:56] uh so I have a couple of IDs I'm gonna
[03:58] I'm gonna share them on the notepad
[04:01] and we're gonna go through a quick vote
[04:04] whatever ideas is your favorite and now
[04:06] we'll just build the one you like the
[04:07] most
[04:09] maybe we can start like this
[04:11] um
[04:11] pick your favorite
[04:14] oops that's the way to begin
[04:17] I also um this is my first stream ever
[04:19] so I have no idea if the sound is good
[04:22] if the quality is good if you guys can
[04:24] read my screen properly so feel free to
[04:26] be row and Roto in the comments and just
[04:28] let me know if something is wrong so I
[04:30] can adjust and make it better
[04:34] all right when you say yeah when you say
[04:36] the quality is lower your meaning
[04:38] um the the voice or
[04:42] okay okay screen
[04:52] let's say if I share my screen for
[04:54] coding you guys I guess you guys cannot
[04:57] see anything right it must be way too
[04:59] small I would have to zoom probably like
[05:01] this way
[05:04] I do something like this it might be a
[05:05] bit better because we might spend a lot
[05:07] of time on the vs code editor
[05:27] all right let's see I'm gonna try to
[05:28] write big okay
[05:40] all righty so the first one would be
[05:44] um
[05:45] if you guys know who Nevada is
[05:49] I can't
[05:51] I'm a big fan of him it's uh it's an
[05:54] entrepreneur who writes a lot of uh
[05:56] crisp and sharp quotes that are very
[05:59] inspirational
[06:00] I want to make an
[06:03] an app that at least it's 50 or whatever
[06:06] best quotes
[06:07] and
[06:09] as a user without an account you can
[06:11] just pick your favorite ones and you
[06:13] will show that to the world who which of
[06:16] these codes are the favorites from
[06:18] people
[06:19] so
[06:23] so basically it's like a it looks like I
[06:26] made an app that is called 50 hacks
[06:27] where you can write productivity tips
[06:29] and people can vote download them to
[06:32] find the one that are the best it would
[06:34] be something a bit similar but for
[06:36] another Rubicon quotes
[06:38] uh it's a very short project the only
[06:40] downside of it is that is I don't think
[06:42] there's a way to monetize it
[06:44] um I don't see any way to make money
[06:46] with it so it's not actually a startup
[06:47] but it's a fun project it can be
[06:49] launched in a couple days
[06:51] um that's the first ID that I have
[06:54] so Neville as chosen by Ice chosen
[07:00] by the internet
[07:03] and in number two we would have
[07:05] um
[07:09] okay okay cool
[07:12] number two we'll have
[07:14] um
[07:18] JavaScript
[07:20] best
[07:23] as Frozen again by the internet so a bit
[07:27] similar uh to the first one but instead
[07:30] it's for
[07:31] um for JavaScript Developers
[07:34] so basically you would write you could
[07:36] write a tip
[07:38] um let's say how to uh
[07:41] um sum up the values in an array or
[07:44] some operators that as developers we
[07:47] might not know because they were
[07:48] released a couple years ago like some
[07:50] tips in JavaScript that are very useful
[07:51] for day-to-day tasks that we might not
[07:55] know and that you could plug your medium
[07:57] your Twitter accounts whatever
[08:00] whatever social media or things you're
[08:02] on your YouTube channel for instance if
[08:04] you're a YouTube developer
[08:05] and people could vote on them and decide
[08:09] which ones are the best and I don't know
[08:11] we need to explore those ideas it's very
[08:14] raw for now but we could imagine
[08:16] something like you know you could write
[08:18] the best JavaScript tips and and
[08:20] whatever would happen later
[08:23] um
[08:24] third ID
[08:35] the third ID is a it's a habit tracker
[08:38] it's only for working out for exercising
[08:41] so you would pick your avatar so let's
[08:44] say um
[08:46] yep and my GP card doesn't work
[08:50] ammojp card does not work
[08:52] okay so you could choose your your
[08:55] favorites
[08:56] um avatar for working out so let's say
[08:58] you're a cyclist you could choose the
[08:59] cyclist emoji and you would start level
[09:01] one and then when you would you would
[09:04] set your goal let's say you want to
[09:05] cycle three times a week and then when
[09:07] you're on track with your gold your
[09:09] avatar will grow your emoji will grow
[09:11] and if you're nuts then it will shrink
[09:13] and it's only for working out you could
[09:16] pick different sports you can do cycling
[09:18] gym CrossFit surfing whatever you you
[09:21] like
[09:22] and then I was thinking we could couple
[09:24] that with some kind of like public
[09:27] um
[09:27] avatars so it would have I don't know a
[09:30] room or dashboard or whatever with other
[09:32] people's Avatar with their username
[09:35] underneath it
[09:36] um something like this
[09:40] I'm gonna make this a bit shorter so you
[09:41] guys can see all
[09:49] 30 though
[09:55] there we go
[10:01] so
[10:03] okay here you have it so these are three
[10:06] startups IDs that I have
[10:08] um that I would love to build this week
[10:10] uh I would like you guys to pick your
[10:13] favorite one so you can type in the chat
[10:14] one two or three or whatever the one you
[10:16] like the most I'm gonna add some marks
[10:18] next to it to see which ones are the
[10:20] favorites
[10:21] um if you don't like any just say you
[10:23] don't like any and then we can think and
[10:24] brainstorm for some other ideas but um
[10:27] we would start with this and then once
[10:29] you guys have decided we would
[10:32] um just pick one and we'll go deeper
[10:34] into what exactly is going to be in the
[10:36] app what are the main features we're
[10:38] going to build for that mvp because the
[10:40] idea is to build it in a week
[10:42] which means there are a lot of things
[10:44] that I won't be able to do
[10:47] um so we'll decide you know what's
[10:49] important for the MVP what's not we'll
[10:52] go over whatever design thinking uh the
[10:55] basic things that needs to be done the
[10:57] tech stack
[10:58] um and then we'll go over a few days of
[11:01] this so first uh days will be basically
[11:03] the ID and coding it then I'm going to
[11:07] build a landing page I'm gonna try to
[11:09] make a logo or something and then
[11:10] hopefully the last day day seven I would
[11:13] launch it on product ends if that works
[11:20] okay we have a number three for yen
[11:24] all day yeah I'm also a daily workout
[11:25] person yeah I think I'm gonna type I'm
[11:28] gonna count this one as well
[11:32] um
[11:40] there we go sorry I'm gonna
[11:41] maybe I can Fleet screen so I can see
[11:44] what you guys are typing in okay
[11:47] wait
[11:52] number three two okay
[11:54] gamified happy tracker for exercising
[11:58] all right so yeah if you're tuning in
[12:00] right now the ID is you pick uh an ID
[12:03] among this list of three uh stuff
[12:06] and um I'm going to attempt to build it
[12:09] in about a week
[12:12] so if you if you haven't uh if you
[12:15] haven't been here at the beginning yet
[12:16] so three startup IDs uh the first one is
[12:20] um I'm gonna list all the quotes from
[12:21] Naval arabicans
[12:23] and users would be able to choose
[12:26] without an account the one they like the
[12:27] most
[12:28] and then at the end you will show a
[12:30] dashboard of the best quotes from Naval
[12:33] chosen by the internet so the first one
[12:34] will be the one with the most of those
[12:36] uh the second one is a list of tips for
[12:40] JavaScript language so uh you know
[12:43] things like how to concatenate an array
[12:44] how to reduce use the register function
[12:46] like a lot of JavaScript tips that as
[12:49] developers maybe for years we don't
[12:51] remember all the time
[12:52] and um and seeing them would would
[12:55] actually uh you know like you could
[12:57] learn some new stuff in JavaScript
[13:00] in the last one is a habit tracker
[13:03] specialized for workouts where you could
[13:07] grow an avatar and you could level it up
[13:09] as you reach your goals the Avatar will
[13:12] get bigger and bigger and bigger and you
[13:15] could see other people avatars and your
[13:18] avatar will represent the workout you do
[13:20] so if you're climbing you have the
[13:22] boulder Emoji if you're running you have
[13:25] the Shoes Emoji uh your emoji was
[13:27] basically represents a sport you have
[13:29] and I will find a way with CSS to make
[13:31] it grow or Shrink if you're reaching
[13:34] your goals looks like we have a some
[13:37] kind of a winner for three
[13:44] okay we can write those too
[13:50] if you're if you're here um you can also
[13:52] you know whatever uh looks like number
[13:55] three is going to be the winner you can
[13:57] just write down some stuff you think
[13:59] would be worth it some ID some
[14:01] suggestions some crazy things you might
[14:03] have in your mind and uh we can explore
[14:05] everything
[14:15] this is basically a tweeter you guys on
[14:17] Twitter will actually choose what I'm
[14:19] gonna do for seven times 24 hours
[14:22] so uh so please carefully be careful
[14:26] here
[14:38] yeah that can do it but I'm just
[14:40] wondering how many people will
[14:44] we could we could try okay try
[14:50] next example we're building it for
[14:52] people who are not in Indonesia and
[14:54] Nancy champur is one of the most common
[14:55] meal you can get in Indonesia it's uh
[14:58] it's a mix of rice with a bit of
[14:59] vegetables eggs and things
[15:01] uh it usually costs about a dollar or
[15:04] two
[15:05] um it has a lot of good things for you
[15:07] despite a little bit of oil and you can
[15:09] get it pretty much any restaurants they
[15:11] can cook it in two minutes
[15:13] it's very it's most typical Indonesian
[15:15] meal you can have
[15:18] [Music]
[15:21] I think I have to make a new tweets
[15:50] oh
[15:55] okay that has to be short best quotes
[15:59] uh
[16:05] ice cream best tips
[16:12] and
[16:15] that's not gonna be 25 characters uh
[16:20] how do we call that
[16:22] 25 characters for to summarize this app
[16:32] Pokemon evolution instead of emoji that
[16:34] would be nice everyone that uh I I think
[16:37] if the goal is to make it in a week it's
[16:38] going to be hard to get a designer from
[16:41] upwork
[16:44] it's gonna be a bit tricky yeah because
[16:45] I want to try to cover all the sports
[16:49] and
[16:50] it would work if you know I had only one
[16:52] sport but having like this 50 kinds of
[16:56] sports and having like a design ready
[16:58] within a week for that I think it's
[17:00] gonna be a bit tricky for a weekly stuff
[17:01] but if the app works I think that's that
[17:03] makes sense to replace images by actual
[17:06] avatars yeah
[17:12] yeah
[17:14] show a connection to the ID3
[17:17] Channel
[17:19] does this travel have an open API
[17:25] Avatar
[17:28] people understand this
[17:33] workout
[17:41] yeah that's not crazy good but I might
[17:43] do it no
[17:46] Escape scroll your workout
[17:58] all right
[18:00] we're gonna try this one
[18:15] okay you guys can vote I will share the
[18:17] link to the tweet in here so maybe that
[18:19] will make it a bit simpler
[18:22] you guys can vote on your favorite one
[18:25] um
[18:25] I think we have a winner already but you
[18:28] know just to see
[18:31] so again for people Chingy Right Now um
[18:36] I would love you to pick your favorite
[18:38] ID from that Twitter poll
[18:40] so you can decide what I'm gonna be
[18:42] building this week
[18:43] um I'm gonna be tuning in every day for
[18:45] seven days or until the startup is live
[18:48] so it takes less or more it's going to
[18:50] be less or more live
[18:53] um now we are chatting and everything
[18:56] over the IDS that is going to be built
[18:59] and then we're gonna move on to you know
[19:01] make that idea like uh how what's gonna
[19:04] be in that ID and then cutting it doing
[19:07] all the design thing the landing page
[19:09] and launching it on product hand credits
[19:12] all the typical platforms we could
[19:14] launch on
[19:17] let's see what we have
[19:18] okay
[19:24] good you think four votes is enough to
[19:26] spend the whole week on that project I
[19:29] think that's enough I don't like
[19:30] thinking too much
[19:33] I'm reading quickly the travel
[19:35] documentation
[19:36] um I don't know who mentioned that
[19:39] yeah
[19:41] if you
[19:43] um
[19:47] I like that I think it's fun
[19:49] um
[19:50] if you're here let me know let us know
[19:53] what you guys think of connecting it to
[19:54] Strava eventually I don't know how that
[19:56] works but
[19:58] um
[20:04] yeah when you publish because I'm not a
[20:07] big Strava user but I think when you
[20:09] publish you can publish activities like
[20:11] you've done your workout your cycling or
[20:12] something
[20:14] uh but the only downside of it is that
[20:16] we're not going to be able to support
[20:18] others for than the ones Trevor
[20:22] allows running cycling hiking yeah
[20:25] the thing is if I think if we go with
[20:27] Strava we're going to put aside all the
[20:28] people who are
[20:31] um going to the gym or or you know doing
[20:34] these kind of activities
[20:39] I think we have a clear winner okay
[20:50] okay
[20:51] so there we go I think I could close it
[20:53] we can close the pole we can go with the
[20:55] ID number three
[20:59] growing up a targeting word counts
[21:03] oh
[21:10] all right so let's let's talk
[21:13] um we're gonna go with this ID sure
[21:21] next time uh
[21:24] right
[21:26] um looks like it's good it's it's always
[21:28] the same I use
[21:30] next
[21:33] next GS for the front end
[21:36] last minute ID go go go go if you guys
[21:38] have any ID for that app so maybe I'm
[21:40] gonna make bigger the app will be this
[21:42] growing an avatar when you work out and
[21:45] I was thinking to make it public so that
[21:47] everybody can see your avatar and you
[21:49] can see your friends and whatever
[21:50] whoever's Avatar that's the idea
[21:54] this is what we're gonna build
[21:58] uh the tech stack
[22:05] uh exactly is gonna be next GS plus
[22:11] um as always it'll wind
[22:14] CSS plus the easy
[22:17] UI or the components the AI components
[22:19] if you guys don't know what Daisy UI is
[22:21] I tweet all the time about it but if you
[22:24] don't know uh check it out this is what
[22:26] they do
[22:28] um they have a fairly simple
[22:32] they have a lot of companies you can use
[22:34] it it's cute it's working well
[22:38] it's uh it's clear they have a lot of
[22:40] themes so you can give your apps
[22:42] whatever theme you want you can go crazy
[22:43] with this
[22:45] um and you can do a lot of stuff with
[22:47] this and that would be way enough for
[22:48] that app
[22:50] so next year I still win
[22:52] um
[22:54] I think
[22:56] Plus
[22:58] capacitor I think for
[23:01] all right that's a big conversation we
[23:02] need to have mobile app or no mobile app
[23:04] I think it needs a mobile app
[23:08] yeah people gonna show up daily it needs
[23:10] a mobile app
[23:17] yep okay
[23:20] they're gonna make the seven days launch
[23:21] tricky
[23:22] um
[23:25] yeah it needs a mobile app right
[23:30] okay yeah
[23:36] all nighters
[23:39] I'll be fine yeah a complexity tour if
[23:41] you guys haven't checked it out uh
[23:44] it's an amazing technology that allows
[23:46] you to embed a wave view in a mobile
[23:48] apps that's how I ship uh two apps on
[23:50] the stores recently and usually in a few
[23:53] minutes yeah in 30 minutes you can be
[23:56] done with the basics and they have some
[23:58] amazing plugins so you can call local
[24:00] notifications opens the user settings
[24:02] the camera or whatever
[24:05] um in our case we'll use just a basic
[24:06] just to embed the websites inside
[24:10] um
[24:12] and I think for okay so that's for the
[24:15] the front end for the for the back end
[24:17] we're gonna have we we need a database a
[24:20] mongodb for the database
[24:23] and
[24:27] for no Chrome jobs
[24:30] and I think the slash API
[24:34] um from next year's
[24:37] will do the work for the backend
[24:42] okay okay well we'll keep we'll go back
[24:45] to the tech stack a bit later
[24:48] um because it depends on what features
[24:50] we're gonna have inside of that app
[24:52] let me just check what you guys have
[24:54] said as president
[25:02] yeah
[25:03] um Premiere if I'm saying correctly
[25:06] um I think yeah that's what I'm gonna do
[25:08] is um people will pick an emoji and I
[25:12] will increase the size with other scale
[25:15] or
[25:17] or as you said like the pixel uh from
[25:20] just a basic CSS filter and I think that
[25:22] will do the work here and probably I'm
[25:24] gonna do some
[25:25] saturate thing so I'm gonna
[25:29] maybe reduce the colors
[25:31] when you're level one for instance and
[25:33] increase them when you're level two or
[25:35] three or something so it looks more
[25:37] bright and colorful
[25:48] yeah otherwise that's connected to the
[25:51] nasty jump or comments mentioned earlier
[25:53] but uh yeah I got a pretty bad buddy
[25:55] belly recently
[25:57] and uh luckily I had some tweet
[25:59] schedules so pretending nothing happened
[26:01] but uh yeah that's something that
[26:02] happens sometimes here
[26:10] oh the Farm's okay
[26:20] oh so you're okay so that's that's
[26:22] here you have
[26:25] a character so you would have I advice
[26:26] bigger isn't working on Google do
[26:29] something
[26:53] okay that works here okay that does just
[26:54] doesn't work in Google
[27:02] okay it's very strange
[27:05] um
[27:14] hey Federico nice here we go we're live
[27:17] we've picked up the startup uh we're
[27:19] going to make an avatar that grows as
[27:21] you work out
[27:22] and we are
[27:24] writing some ideas see how that would
[27:26] work so
[27:27] let's talk about features what do we
[27:29] have in that app
[27:38] keep it better if I go this way okay
[27:43] all right
[27:46] um so
[27:48] Rick
[27:50] have it I'll be able to I think it would
[27:53] be the mostly the main feature actually
[27:55] you just track show up
[27:58] take your habit
[28:02] that you would have to be able to create
[28:04] you have it
[28:09] um so again the call the goal is to make
[28:12] it achievable in seven days
[28:14] so I'm gonna try to build the minimum
[28:16] features
[28:17] which means things like delete my habit
[28:19] or edit my habit will not be part of the
[28:23] MVP I will ship it without it even
[28:25] though it's important because I think I
[28:27] need to go really all in in the core
[28:29] thing which is people want to see their
[28:31] Avatar growing that's the I think that's
[28:34] the most important part of the app and
[28:37] delete
[28:38] um
[28:39] a workout or delete an emoji or edit it
[28:42] doesn't
[28:44] I think it's not necessary for that part
[28:45] so try to work out try to work out
[28:49] um login
[28:51] sign up
[29:10] you guys see any other core features
[29:12] that are
[29:16] doing something on the database that are
[29:19] not just the viewing but like actually
[29:20] posting something in the database
[29:36] go into details with this
[29:42] great workout that means Peak energy
[29:44] yep yep I think
[29:47] the the app makes sense if everything is
[29:49] public so as soon as you you won't this
[29:52] you would have a username
[29:54] but you won't have like I won't show
[29:56] anything else than your username and
[29:58] your public workouts
[30:00] um so I think every avatars will be
[30:03] public or Simplicity is like I think the
[30:06] app really has like a purpose if if
[30:08] things are public by default maybe in
[30:11] the if you know users are not happy with
[30:13] that maybe in the future I can add like
[30:15] a private option
[30:16] but I think as long as you don't show
[30:19] any information besides the username and
[30:21] the Avatar I think it's it's could be
[30:23] fun to just be public by default
[30:26] so yeah definitely they're going to be
[30:27] public room to see avatars here
[30:30] uh when you create a workout you pick
[30:31] your emoji
[30:37] so that can be this
[30:45] port
[30:49] hey we have oh nice we have a bunch of
[30:52] images that's cool
[30:59] that's cool already emojis always uh
[31:01] design the easiest design way to go with
[31:05] an emoji
[31:06] um
[31:07] when you log in when you sign up you can
[31:13] username
[31:18] all right I think the another part that
[31:21] is important is not everybody works out
[31:24] the same way some people work out daily
[31:26] some people work out twice a week
[31:29] it's um it's always a dilemma to either
[31:33] one workout equal
[31:36] one point so meaning your avatar will
[31:39] grow or whatever like you gain
[31:40] experience when you work out one times
[31:42] or should it or should we make it fair
[31:45] for everyone and the guy who works or
[31:47] the girl who works out seven days a week
[31:49] and the other person who works two times
[31:51] a week work out two times a week
[31:53] and achieve the same amount of
[31:55] experience if they reach their goals so
[31:57] you look into the app you say I want to
[31:59] work out six days a week
[32:01] if at the end of the week you've done
[32:02] your six workouts you get let's say 10
[32:04] point of experience
[32:06] on the other hand if you say you want to
[32:08] work out two times a week
[32:10] at the end of the week if you w two or
[32:12] three workouts you also get 10 points of
[32:14] experience
[32:22] expansion we got the same amount of
[32:24] workouts
[32:29] so if I'm understanding well you're
[32:33] saying that
[32:34] I do six workouts a week or two workouts
[32:37] a week I'll get either 60 points or 20
[32:39] points
[32:48] okay okay
[32:50] um I think I'm that I I would agree with
[32:53] you let's see what what other people
[32:56] think would you guys
[32:57] um maybe you guys can share how many
[33:00] times a week do you work out
[33:02] and what do you think about that
[33:17] okay
[33:26] okay
[33:35] so for Simplicity we can start with
[33:37] something like this if I work out one
[33:40] time again again in point of experience
[33:44] and
[33:47] oh okay
[33:53] nice to have you here
[33:58] I didn't see the goal is
[33:59] self-improvement
[34:06] oh yeah that's a good yeah that's
[34:08] actually a good point here
[34:15] because if if it's self-improvement
[34:19] and I
[34:21] if it's self-improvement yeah I think
[34:23] one workout would be 10 points and 10
[34:25] would be 100 points and if you're
[34:28] competing against other
[34:29] you have to make it fair for everyone
[34:31] yeah
[34:37] I love the example Ayan
[34:49] foreign
[34:59] okay
[35:00] so so somehow if I understand well we
[35:02] have to make it fair for everyone if
[35:05] whether you work out two times a week or
[35:07] you work out seven times a week
[35:09] you have to set a goal and your points
[35:12] will be calculated based on your goal
[35:43] yep yep yep
[35:47] let's mix let's see some examples
[36:16] with Benny wither
[36:18] raining all morning and instead of needs
[36:20] sunny and super hot
[36:30] right I'm gonna be quiet but I'm I'm
[36:31] processing it then I think that's the
[36:33] core feature because how we connect the
[36:37] your actual your physical real workouts
[36:40] to your avatar growing is crucial in the
[36:43] way the app will work
[36:46] so we need we need to sit down and
[36:49] and actually make it make it uh right
[36:53] um
[37:01] okay
[37:03] I'll be uh well I think I'll still be
[37:05] streaming when you're in your back Luca
[37:07] I will wish you a good night
[37:28] thanks buddy
[37:52] I think you guys are using Duolingo
[37:56] um I recall they make something where
[37:57] they make you commit to a goal so let's
[38:01] say a seven days trick
[38:05] and then I think they calculate your
[38:06] points based on the goal you set for
[38:08] yourself
[38:12] which I think
[38:27] yeah I think we'll go with um if you
[38:29] guys let me know if I'm wrong but I
[38:31] think we'll go with the goal setting
[38:34] approach where it's fair for everyone so
[38:36] you can get let's say a hundred points a
[38:39] week
[38:40] and the points are calculated based on
[38:42] how far you are from your goal so let's
[38:44] say you say you're gonna work out
[38:46] seven days a week seven times a week
[38:50] if you do you will get 100 points
[38:54] and if you don't you will get X points
[38:56] based on I'll make some kind of
[38:58] calculations on math do you still get
[39:00] some points but not as much as if you
[39:02] reach your goal
[39:04] and at the same time the guy who say I'm
[39:05] gonna work out three times a week
[39:07] you can get a hundred points if he does
[39:09] or if she does 100 is three workouts
[39:13] you'll get less points if he does less
[39:18] but we need to answer the what happens
[39:22] what happens if
[39:24] that person who does
[39:26] who set the goal of three days three
[39:28] times workouts a week
[39:30] if he's overachieving
[39:34] should we give him more points
[39:36] and in that sense
[39:38] why would someone set up a seven day
[39:41] seven times a week goal because if you
[39:44] if you're rewarded for achieving
[39:47] then people would just set up like a
[39:48] workout once a week
[39:50] and just do it four times a week and get
[39:53] a bunch of points so I think there needs
[39:54] to be some kind of
[39:57] maximum a plateau of
[40:02] oh but at the same time we need to re
[40:06] okay maybe that's where the streaks come
[40:09] in
[40:11] so you can get
[40:13] a maximum of 100 points
[40:16] if you achieve your goal you don't get
[40:19] anything else
[40:21] If you overachieve you said three times
[40:23] a week and you do it four or five times
[40:25] you don't get more points
[40:27] but maybe we can come up with the streak
[40:30] which
[40:32] is not going to give you ex experience
[40:34] points but it's going to show you how
[40:37] consistent the person is so
[40:39] if if I'm working out every day at least
[40:42] I have a streak that's going to show
[40:43] something like 21 or 30 or something and
[40:46] then eventually we could show at least
[40:48] on the leaderboard or or something so we
[40:50] have a point calculation that is fair
[40:51] for everyone whether you work out one
[40:53] times a week or six times a week
[40:55] and at the same time
[40:58] you have your streak that shows up how
[41:00] many times you've been working out so if
[41:02] you're a heavy uh workout person
[41:06] then you have you have a trick that
[41:08] represents you and
[41:11] and that feels good
[41:14] I think we can go with that
[41:23] I think so yeah
[41:26] I think the points are the system that
[41:29] is fair for everyone that's gonna
[41:31] compare people with people
[41:33] so you can tell whether that person has
[41:35] been sticking or not to their goals and
[41:37] the strict I think it's secondary maybe
[41:39] I can I can add it in a single part in
[41:42] the app that will just show
[41:46] how much this person has been working
[41:48] out because with the fair point system
[41:51] for reaching your goal you don't know
[41:53] whether the person is a person who works
[41:56] out a lot or once a week
[41:58] you just know that person is actually
[42:00] reaching their goals but with the trick
[42:03] the streak you can see actually if that
[42:05] person is going to the gym every day or
[42:07] if the person who has a bit less time
[42:09] and is doing it like once or twice a
[42:10] week
[42:17] what is this
[42:55] kind of whatever what I have in mind
[43:05] so
[43:08] if
[43:11] so if I
[43:14] so let's say I work out week one
[43:23] I do one workout
[43:26] I reach my goal
[43:29] it gets 100 new XP
[43:42] I do zero workouts
[44:02] pick three
[44:04] say three workouts
[44:07] 300 percent
[44:09] gold
[44:11] EXP
[44:13] now what looks like for a person who's
[44:16] say they'll design a workout one time a
[44:18] week
[44:19] at the end of the three weeks it got 200
[44:21] points
[44:24] it would work the same for someone who
[44:26] works out six times a week
[44:33] and let's say three workouts
[44:49] ready
[44:52] and workouts
[44:57] that's about right
[45:11] I think we got something in here
[45:19] I became a g
[45:20] um
[45:22] I tried the workouts
[45:27] your workout big emoji and sit
[45:48] I'm awake
[46:01] I tried the workouts just
[46:14] next once a day
[46:21] I'm crazy okay
[46:27] how do we get
[46:28] how do we get experience to people so
[46:34] I see two ways of doing it the first way
[46:36] is the very bootstrap way
[46:39] if I want to make an app in one week I
[46:41] think it's probably the way I'll go
[46:42] which is I assume people will never
[46:45] change their goals
[46:46] and when you set the goal for
[46:49] three times a week
[46:51] I calculate your experience based on the
[46:55] data I got from the database
[46:57] it means if one day I change the app and
[47:00] you change your goal all the data you
[47:02] have from the previous time where your
[47:03] goal was like three times a week if you
[47:05] know you set it up to four times a week
[47:07] your experience will change
[47:08] even though you reach your goals in the
[47:10] past
[47:13] or the other way would be
[47:35] or maybe there's a better way maybe
[47:38] every time you track your habit
[47:42] I'll check your the goal you set up for
[47:44] your workout so three times a week
[47:49] and if you're
[47:51] you get experience points
[47:55] based on that thing so let's say it's
[47:57] your first workout it's Monday you work
[47:58] out
[48:00] you've done thirty percent of your
[48:01] thirty three percent of your goal you're
[48:03] gonna get whatever the total maximum
[48:05] number of experience you can get divided
[48:07] by three
[48:08] in the second day you'll get the same
[48:10] thing and then the third day you'll get
[48:12] the same thing
[48:13] and then If you overachieve it you just
[48:14] don't get anything just I'll just keep
[48:16] track of your record of your workout
[48:21] and so every time you teach your
[48:24] exercise habit your overall experience
[48:27] will be
[48:29] your the record in the database of your
[48:32] experience will actually increase
[48:34] I think that's probably the best way to
[48:35] go
[48:38] so that if one day you check yeah so you
[48:40] don't lose your Express but how do you
[48:42] lose experience there
[48:46] okay this part where
[48:48] um
[48:49] can get to be tricky do do you guys
[48:51] think we should
[48:54] shrink the Avatar if the user don't show
[48:57] up
[49:26] okay
[49:28] that'd be great love it
[49:34] I think yeah that'll be great I mean in
[49:36] terms of coding it's going to be the
[49:38] simplest thing
[49:40] um
[49:41] I've I've heard so I I created a happy
[49:43] tracker and some people mentioned that
[49:47] they like they would like the idea of
[49:49] having a punishment
[49:51] or not showing up
[49:53] because
[49:55] yeah okay so
[50:11] yeah okay I think I like what you said
[50:13] here and I think yeah because anyway it
[50:15] gets bigger so
[50:17] if we see a big Avatar
[50:22] you know the person has been worked out
[50:24] in the past
[50:25] and you know if that person hasn't been
[50:27] working out hard for the last two weeks
[50:35] it's okay
[50:43] no punishments great
[50:52] yeah that's true yeah smart smart
[50:55] comment yeah
[51:04] it's time to brainstorm
[51:51] I think
[51:54] monster is that yeah
[52:01] maybe um if we if we people track their
[52:04] goals per week maybe it could be a
[52:06] weekly stuff
[52:09] maybe I could have a chrome job that
[52:12] chicks
[52:14] once a week if people have achieved
[52:17] every Monday if people have achieved
[52:19] their
[52:21] goal
[52:24] and make them lose like
[52:26] something like
[52:29] it's like
[52:32] you would lose like um
[52:35] some some experience if you don't
[52:37] achieve your goal
[52:41] or
[52:42] wait
[52:54] yeah I think that would work
[52:57] I think that would work so every time
[52:59] you work out you're getting some kind of
[53:01] experience and there's a plateau with a
[53:03] threshold you cannot go over
[53:06] um so that it's fair for everyone
[53:08] and then at the end of the week there's
[53:11] some kind of server check that make sure
[53:13] that you've been tracking something so
[53:17] haven't worked out at all
[53:22] I think that's where the punishments
[53:24] come in
[53:25] I think you need to be punished if you
[53:27] don't or if you don't reach like let's
[53:28] say 50 of your goal or something
[53:33] so
[53:35] if you stick to your goal you get
[53:37] something
[53:40] if you do it a little bit but not too
[53:41] much like you don't reach your goal but
[53:43] at least you do something you still get
[53:45] something where you don't get as much as
[53:46] if you reach your goal
[53:48] and if you don't show up
[53:50] then
[53:53] it's shrinks your emoji strings and
[53:56] every week
[53:57] you lose some experience let's say like
[53:59] 50 points of experience or something
[54:01] do you think that would be fair
[54:03] A man also sent me your Twitter uh
[54:06] you've been sure like I wanna I wanna
[54:08] follow him and you get so many DB
[54:10] insights
[54:11] I would love to connect and see who you
[54:13] actually are on Twitter
[54:16] if you didn't already
[54:19] if you weren't
[54:22] actually on Twitter
[54:25] you're basically building the app with
[54:27] me
[54:29] where co-founders now
[54:37] foreign
[54:42] oh wait I think I know you
[54:51] I wasn't like
[54:55] I love that man
[55:03] so cool bro
[55:06] okay
[55:13] yeah I think we'll go with that okay
[55:18] one more example one workout
[55:22] s
[55:25] so you'd lose in this case
[55:31] could lose 50 XP
[55:39] in week three you did soon workout
[55:42] you would have 100
[55:45] minus and you would be at 150.
[55:52] for the guy here who does three workouts
[56:02] no it's minus 50.
[56:13] so you would
[56:15] yeah so that would be zero
[56:20] Bixby
[56:22] and then seven workouts
[56:25] some percent of the goal 100 XP okay
[56:27] what it looks like
[56:45] all right
[56:51] all right that seems about right
[56:55] there's any
[56:57] below you see here
[56:59] anyway to trick this stuff or
[57:05] you reach your goal
[57:07] you get total maximum XP
[57:10] you reach part of your goals you still
[57:13] get some EXP
[57:14] ERT unit which you achieved
[57:16] you don't do anything for the week you
[57:19] lose 50 50 XP
[57:27] and then we would have a system where
[57:29] you're level one you start level one
[57:31] with zero expert
[57:33] then to get to level two you will need
[57:35] let's say 100 XP
[57:38] oh wait no that's too much I would mean
[57:41] people would spend a week
[57:44] um
[57:45] you get the level two you would need
[57:46] Maybe
[57:53] percentage something like this
[57:58] that means you can reach it in either
[58:01] one day or if you work out every day you
[58:03] would take
[58:05] um
[58:05] a couple days like maybe four days make
[58:07] it okay from zero to three days
[58:12] you can say just something like this
[58:17] is whatever
[58:25] all three 50 XP
[58:28] or
[58:32] yeah yeah I agree again yeah that's why
[58:35] I think 25 EXP
[58:38] you can to get 25 exp you need if you
[58:41] have a one or two workouts or even three
[58:45] workouts a week
[58:46] you can get it like in a day like you
[58:50] show up you dig and you you level up if
[58:53] you're more hardcore and you have like a
[58:54] seven day workout goal
[58:57] it will take you two days to get it I
[59:00] think
[59:01] the four yeah something like two days
[59:05] or something like this or maybe like
[59:08] this
[59:10] yeah number four would be 100 XP
[59:15] so that means like basically from First
[59:17] witch because the maximum you can get
[59:19] per week is this
[59:24] so you could get to level three in the
[59:26] first week
[59:28] hello Mr Den hookov
[59:32] and their makeup box YouTube channel
[59:38] bro I want to see you uh using the app
[59:40] and and level up your character while
[59:42] building a an a habit tracker where you
[59:45] grow an avatar
[59:47] as you go through your goal
[59:50] you get experience points for achieving
[59:52] your goal whether this is one time
[59:54] workout a week or the seven days workout
[59:56] a week
[59:58] and then you level up and you can see
[60:00] other people so I'm gonna build that app
[60:02] I'm gonna follow you and I'm gonna make
[60:03] sure you're gonna be featured on the top
[60:05] and everybody will see your avatar and
[60:07] your Twitter name
[60:10] and uh hopefully you will get uh you
[60:12] stick to that goal
[60:18] it's simpler
[60:36] a little introverted look I get even
[60:38] close the curtains
[60:40] I mean uh spaceship mode
[60:42] don't talk to anyone
[60:46] I mean you can build it with us oh now
[60:49] if you have if you have any feedback man
[60:50] it's cool um
[60:53] I'm just making the math for how much
[60:55] you can level up and things the ID so
[60:58] you have you have those emojis
[61:00] you pick your it's only for working out
[61:03] so you pick your emoji that represent
[61:05] the workout you do you can pick one two
[61:06] or three whatever
[61:08] and then you set up a goal so let's say
[61:10] you want to do basketball one times a
[61:11] week
[61:12] and you want to cycle three times a week
[61:14] three eggs a week
[61:19] um Bingo and then
[61:22] um whatever you do you can get a total
[61:24] number of 100
[61:27] 100 exp experience points per workout
[61:31] that you do
[61:33] and then
[61:35] um if you let's say you work out you
[61:37] cycle two times this week you would get
[61:39] something like 66 XP if you cycle three
[61:42] times a week you will get 100 x bit if
[61:45] you cycle four times a week you will get
[61:46] just still 100 exp but if you cycle like
[61:49] zero time this week you would lose
[61:53] minus 15 space
[61:57] and same for basketball
[61:59] but because you set a goal of only once
[62:01] a week if you take your habits if your
[62:03] basketball once a week then you get 100
[62:05] EXP
[62:06] and if you don't you lose 50 50 XP
[62:09] and then your avatar will grow so you
[62:11] have this like Emoji whatever cycling
[62:13] at the beginning will be small and maybe
[62:16] not super colorful
[62:18] and then as you grow
[62:21] Bingo as you grow it'll get bigger in
[62:25] size
[62:28] and
[62:31] this is the app basically
[62:35] dingo and so level oh maybe I can put it
[62:38] in here
[62:49] there we go
[62:51] cute emojis
[62:54] the win
[62:57] okay
[62:59] um I think we can work the math on level
[63:01] one two three four five later
[63:06] I also think level one two and three
[63:08] should be accessible for the first week
[63:10] at least even maybe level four we'll see
[63:13] how many emojis we make
[63:20] okay let me get let me read what you
[63:22] guys are saying
[63:24] oh man hot that would be dope
[63:28] you French menu
[63:30] I'll be so dope like the oh man the
[63:33] widget I think is the
[63:35] is a color I think
[63:38] I don't think it will I have no idea how
[63:40] to make widgets to be honest I don't
[63:41] even know how to code for Native iOS
[63:43] apps
[63:44] I don't think this would be really hard
[63:48] but I think if it gets
[63:50] nothing I think if it gets some traction
[63:53] if it if if some people like the app and
[63:55] and keep using it after a few days I'll
[63:57] definitely build the widget next
[63:59] that's that's actually killer like
[64:01] singing Ah that's not nice I love it
[64:14] okay all right
[64:17] I think I'll actually nail the first day
[64:18] retention everything else won't matter
[64:20] this much the man is right to make a box
[64:23] um
[64:23] I think the first ever attention I I
[64:27] so the the only purpose of this app is
[64:30] to grow an avatar and see other people's
[64:32] Avatar
[64:34] so I think to nail the first day
[64:36] retention would be able to level up
[64:39] pretty quickly till level two okay all
[64:42] right all right everybody should be able
[64:44] to level up
[64:45] level two
[64:47] from the first eight
[64:50] so whatever your goal is
[64:52] you'll be able to grow your character a
[64:54] little too and if you have a goal that
[64:55] is not super ambitious like let's say
[64:57] you want to work out two times a week
[64:58] which is great but then if you work out
[65:01] one times this week you'll get 50 speed
[65:04] so you'll be able to level up free or
[65:07] something pretty quickly
[65:12] and then we can say something like 60
[65:15] then we can just go on and on from there
[65:16] and I think it will be exponential I
[65:18] think it'll get
[65:20] harder and harder to level up and we can
[65:22] imagine something like 10 levels or
[65:24] something
[65:28] let me go okay I think we got the math
[65:30] we got the math ready we got the core
[65:33] feature for
[65:35] look at the core feature for how this is
[65:37] going to work
[65:39] um so you show up
[65:42] you pick your emoji for the sport you
[65:44] want to do you set the goal how many
[65:46] times a week
[65:48] the app will calculate on the phone so
[65:50] back inside whatever
[65:52] how much experience you're gaining when
[65:53] you track your account
[65:55] and then every Monday or whatever every
[65:58] Sunday
[65:59] I will check on the database how users
[66:02] are doing and if someone hasn't been
[66:04] tracking habits for a week
[66:07] then that person will lose 50 of
[66:09] experience to the minimum level which is
[66:11] level one
[66:12] that person will go to zero
[66:15] um
[66:20] okay okay now we need to talk about the
[66:22] how do we make this public how do I see
[66:25] your guys characters how do you guys see
[66:27] mine
[66:34] how would that look like for now they
[66:36] won't be interaction maybe later we can
[66:38] think about you know cheer up routing
[66:40] for something
[66:53] [Music]
[66:56] okay
[67:01] simply
[67:05] I see you how do I see your avatar how
[67:08] does that look like is it something
[67:09] where everybody sees everybody's Avatar
[67:12] or maybe we create some kind of like
[67:14] boxes and we in up right in corner you
[67:19] see all the characters of a one
[67:25] I think that'll be so funny if it was
[67:27] connected to Twitter
[67:31] that we connected to Twitter and then it
[67:33] would update your Twitter Banner to
[67:34] reflect your emoji
[67:36]  that would be dope
[67:39] well maybe later later we can we can
[67:42] add this later
[67:54] should be
[67:56] should there be some activity like
[68:00] something like done just level up then
[68:03] just tracked his workout habits
[68:06] or should we just see people's avatars
[68:10] with their username into like a big room
[68:13] and and you know the charge would wiggle
[68:16] around
[68:49] okay so if you're tuning in right now uh
[68:52] that might be he'll be strange to you
[68:53] but this is what we're building
[68:55] um a workout Avatar that grows as your
[68:57] workouts uh different levels different
[68:59] Emoji size you can pick one emoji per
[69:01] workout that you're doing and you can
[69:03] grow it every day
[69:05] uh and
[69:07] this has to this I want I think this is
[69:10] fun if it's public if everybody Can See
[69:12] You Avatar
[69:13] uh
[69:16] I have okay okay and no so now the
[69:19] brainstorming is about how do I see
[69:22] other people's Avatar how do I see yours
[69:24] how do you see mine
[69:26] um
[69:26] do you is it your Twitter better is it
[69:29] being updated
[69:30] um is there is like a room in the app
[69:32] where you can see everybody's characters
[69:39] um
[70:02] yeah my new year that's a good that's a
[70:04] good one I think someone mentioned it
[70:05] earlier
[70:08] I think it's really good
[70:11] and the same like I think when if the
[70:14] app gets some tractions and people like
[70:16] the purpose of growing the Avatar and
[70:18] tricking it if they don't show up and
[70:20] doing it in public so everybody says see
[70:22] there Avatar if people like that I think
[70:24] at some point
[70:25] um first the widgets and then secondly
[70:27] adding changing those emojis for maybe
[70:32] like
[70:33] cute or whatever like something designed
[70:36] by a professional not just me
[70:38] um
[70:39] that would that would make a lot of
[70:40] sense and leaderboards yeah um
[70:46] okay
[70:47] so
[70:49] I'm using
[70:52] [Music]
[70:52] um
[70:55] something like this right
[71:00] oh okay
[71:14] oh I like that maybe
[71:19] maybe the leaderboards will be per
[71:21] Sports
[71:22] so there will be a limited like maybe 30
[71:24] or 50 Sports
[71:27] which means maybe maybe we could have a
[71:29] it could show you by default the
[71:31] leaderboard of the sports you're into
[71:35] you can explore all their leaderboards
[71:36] if you want
[71:48] yeah Duolingo with the leagues yeah
[71:54] okay so that's that's the forever
[71:55] question that comes back I do
[71:58] so what I do on habits Garden is I have
[72:00] a little boards per different time
[72:01] frames so 24 hours seven day all time
[72:04] and everything
[72:05] and then you can you cannot lose
[72:07] experience you can only gain it
[72:09] so as you go through the app you get
[72:11] more and more and more and to make it
[72:12] fair for people who are just showing up
[72:14] in the app
[72:15] it's easy to get to know 24 hours later
[72:17] board if you're very consistent
[72:19] and for this one you have to be
[72:21] consistent all week and everything
[72:22] before for that app since you can use
[72:24] experience
[72:26] maybe we don't need all that thing
[72:39] but there's
[72:42] doing well because if you show up in the
[72:45] app in one month and you have already a
[72:47] bunch of guys who are at the top of the
[72:49] leaderboard
[72:51] unless they stop doing their habits
[72:52] there's no way I catch up with them
[72:54] and I find this a bit demotivating I
[72:57] want to be able to be in that little
[72:59] board
[73:17] the way I imagined it was something very
[73:19] public you once you create your account
[73:21] your avatars are public and that mix
[73:24] with everyone
[73:27] because if the thing is
[73:30] I feel it's gonna be hard to
[73:34] if the app is meant to play with friends
[73:36] most people will say like but I don't
[73:38] have a friend to play with
[73:41] or maybe their friends are already using
[73:42] something else
[73:44] and
[73:46] that's why I think
[73:59] yeah yeah that's right menu here we're
[74:02] gonna start with the global tab
[74:03] something public for everyone and later
[74:05] we can add some features like friends
[74:08] um follow your friends in just a second
[74:10] what he did for Heavy's card and you
[74:12] have a public activity and you can see
[74:14] your friend's activity
[74:18] and yet at some point also I think this
[74:20] is going to be secondary but I think I'm
[74:21] going to add streaks so you know the
[74:23] person's trick
[74:25] but for now the mechanics from going
[74:27] from your real workout to how many
[74:30] um experience you get yeah mvpa it's
[74:32] always like maybe I had this feature in
[74:34] that we're gonna try to keep it simple
[74:35] so for now it connects your real
[74:37] activity to experience points by having
[74:40] you set up a goal and how you stick to
[74:43] your goal will leave you a fixed number
[74:45] of experience and the less you take your
[74:47] goal the less experience you get and if
[74:49] you don't even stick to your goal at all
[74:50] you're going to lose your experience
[74:52] and that system is going to work out for
[74:54] every person
[74:56] do we display those experience how do we
[74:58] show users on the leaderboard it's
[75:01] another question
[75:03] and
[75:04] uh Ian said that losing experiences
[75:07] could be useless in that case and I
[75:09] agree is if you have time sensitive like
[75:11] time restricted leaderboards
[75:14] um that that puts people basically in
[75:16] different leagues so if you're being
[75:18] using the app for a month you're in the
[75:19] league for people who have been using
[75:21] the app for a month and if you've been
[75:22] using it for a day or 24 hours you're
[75:24] going to be in that league in the
[75:25] different League
[75:28] but I I still think the fact that
[75:32] you're losing XP
[75:34] it gives so for instance one of the
[75:36] flows of habits gardening here is that
[75:40] um um the creator of the app so I am of
[75:42] the top of it and since I'm doing my
[75:45] habits every day nobody can really catch
[75:47] up with me
[75:48] and that's the thing is even though I
[75:50] don't show up I still I still stay ahead
[75:52] and I don't give another it doesn't
[75:55] allow people to just overtake me
[75:58] on the other hand if I was losing
[76:00] experience when I was not doing my
[76:02] habits then it will give a chance to
[76:04] Gabby and Gian to move at the top
[76:07] and also I think as in terms of um
[76:10] psychology
[76:12] having my
[76:14] experience or Avatar shrinking
[76:17] if I don't show up it creates something
[76:19] where I don't want to lose it's like
[76:21] I've been showing up three days I level
[76:23] up level four
[76:24] my avatar is sexy and and bright and it
[76:27] has a lot of colors
[76:28] and if I don't show up I'm gonna lose it
[76:32] whereas on the other hand if you remove
[76:33] that
[76:34] um losing exp feature
[76:36] then
[76:38] if I don't show up it's okay it's no big
[76:40] deal because I'm still there I don't
[76:42] lose anything that's why I think the
[76:43] losing XP feature is kind of important
[76:45] for that that
[76:48] I mean I might be wrong maybe you guys
[76:51] you guys can let me know what you think
[76:54] whether you would like the app to have
[76:56] um if your XP would shrink and your
[76:59] avatar will I mean your fish shrinks or
[77:01] your avatar shrinks as uh as you go if
[77:04] you don't show up or if nothing happens
[77:06] if you don't show up
[77:20] okay
[77:21] and yeah menu that's right is
[77:23] um
[77:25] oh
[77:29] oh there we go I think
[77:33] right you have leaderboards per
[77:35] activities so you have a leaderboard for
[77:37] climbing for running for working out
[77:39] and in those leaderboards you have level
[77:42] one level 2004.
[77:45] people are basically put into categories
[77:48] of the levels that they are in so when
[77:51] you start number one you are basically
[77:52] some kind in the first tab which is all
[77:54] the level one people and people are
[77:56] ranked
[77:58] uh they're first they're filtered by the
[78:00] level so level one and then they're
[78:02] ranked by who has the most exp who is
[78:04] the closest to get to level two and then
[78:06] you have level two and you have a little
[78:07] Board of all the people level two and
[78:09] the one at the top is the one with the
[78:11] most expert that is about to get to
[78:13] level three
[78:14] and
[78:15] you would have one type per level
[78:18] and you would and so where basically
[78:20] people there people are
[78:22] filtered based on their on their current
[78:24] level that makes any sense
[78:41] peace
[78:43] yeah
[78:44] that's a French person's comments
[78:51] see that Paul has advanced oh
[78:55] oh there we go maybe we'll get the the
[78:58] next uh
[79:01] that will be the next startup I could
[79:03] build in public that would be quite easy
[79:04] either actually
[79:32] keep it down
[79:34] there's still
[79:38] yep yep
[80:02] no I mean man that's that's the whole
[80:04] purpose of this I would if I wanted to
[80:06] do something just by myself and and not
[80:08] listen to anyone I would do it in
[80:10] private
[80:12] um so now I'm very thankful you're
[80:13] showing up and uh and you're staying
[80:15] with the stream even though I'm a I'm a
[80:17] really bad streamer and uh it's pretty
[80:20] boring because um I'm just uh you know
[80:22] talking
[80:24] I know I'm very thankful man for all
[80:26] your feedback at school
[80:37] that'd be fun
[80:38] I guess this is going to this is going
[80:39] to look fun
[80:40] so many
[80:43] so I'm going to attempt to build a
[80:45] startup in a week and at the same time
[80:46] I'm I'm thinking of
[80:49] um I want to launch it as well
[80:52] and that means doing a product video
[80:57] the seeing those images growing up gives
[81:00] me a lot of ideas we can actually do
[81:02] something fun uh for the product video
[81:05] you guys will actually uh be behind the
[81:07] scenes and know everything and and uh
[81:09] and part somehow your DNA will somehow
[81:11] be part of the launch so cool I think we
[81:14] got the M
[81:15] um
[81:17] the main feature that will be in this
[81:18] app create your workouts you be care
[81:21] Emoji you set your goal
[81:22] uh
[81:24] you track your workouts
[81:26] once a week you just stick a box
[81:28] something pretty simple and your avatar
[81:30] grows in real time
[81:32] you log in you sign up
[81:34] um something I do for for most of my
[81:37] apps that I launch
[81:39] um the first version never include
[81:41] things like reset password or forgotten
[81:43] password
[81:44] instead I'll add a box that says uh you
[81:48] know like I think I have this unhappy's
[81:50] Garden still
[81:51] yeah feedback box here at the bottom
[81:53] that is always there wherever you go
[81:57] and people can just input their email
[81:59] their feedback
[82:01] and just it's basically it sends me an
[82:03] email through Gmail
[82:05] and uh instead of
[82:07] when you I mean at least when I'm
[82:09] launching nvp I don't want to be
[82:10] bothered with you know how to create
[82:12] reset password tokens and and things
[82:14] like that because if the app is a flop
[82:16] which is the case ninety percent of the
[82:17] time at least I won't have to create
[82:19] this feature for nothing
[82:21] it's kind of what I I'm going to use for
[82:23] it's going to be a really really simple
[82:25] app
[82:27] but basically track your workout create
[82:28] your workouts and uh
[82:34] I'm about to we're going to dive into
[82:36] the next deck now I think we're pretty
[82:38] done with all the features
[82:42] view uh leaderboards
[82:46] it's basically all there is
[82:50] right
[82:54] so for the text tag yeah I wrote it down
[82:57] here
[82:57] um let's make sure that works
[83:00] so next for sure tell win Daisy UI for
[83:03] sure uh the mongodb database is going to
[83:05] be also simple
[83:09] I think I'm going to use so two for the
[83:11] maybe if you guys are Tech you can let
[83:13] me know what you think
[83:14] uh
[83:15] most stuff in the app like tracking
[83:19] viewing like viewing leaderboard create
[83:21] workout track workouts everything uh is
[83:23] pretty like request response stuff so
[83:28] the next JS API will do the work
[83:31] but the part of we need some kind of a
[83:34] clone job that checks every Monday
[83:36] if people have actually done their goal
[83:40] so that if they don't they lose EXP
[83:43] and I think versatile release something
[83:45] like Chrome jobs let me check
[83:48] that
[83:52] okay there we go
[83:54] I think we can use something like this
[83:58] where I have no idea how Crohn's work
[84:00] but I'm gonna schedule a job that every
[84:03] Monday Sunday however
[84:06] will make people lose experience if they
[84:08] don't stick to their goals
[84:20] and call that function
[84:22] everybody everybody can call the
[84:24] function that's kind of weird
[84:28] okay I'll have to set up a weird
[84:30] big best word to make sure nobody can
[84:32] call the function and make everybody
[84:33] losing speed
[84:40] I'm gonna use that Chrome on nextgs
[84:47] right the last thing
[84:50] um
[84:52] so it has to be an app because people
[84:55] will show hopefully people will show up
[84:57] daily
[84:58] so we're gonna use capacitor which is
[85:00] amazing but that's
[85:02] um the only thing
[85:04] is that how do people log in
[85:07] so there will be the typical email
[85:09] password stuff
[85:14] but I think I need some kind of social
[85:16] looking like a tweeter or Google login
[85:30] yep
[85:31] that's a good that's a good point I just
[85:33] think it's not gonna work
[85:35] if we make this an app
[85:40] because yeah I've tried as well it's
[85:42] it's super amazing
[85:44] but the thing is acetor so to turn my
[85:48] next GS website into an app
[85:50] it's going to be inside this capacitor
[85:53] webview
[85:54] and the cookies will be an issue with
[85:57] next
[85:58] oath
[85:59] so when people will sign up with
[86:01] whatever GitHub or a stripe or some uh
[86:03] GitHub Twitter Google
[86:07] then the cookies will not be set in the
[86:09] capacitor review which means user will
[86:11] never be authentified
[86:15] which means we I might have to implement
[86:18] a native uh basic GE Json web token
[86:23] stuff
[86:25] which means like generating tokens for
[86:27] every request
[86:29] or when you sign up I generate an access
[86:32] token for you
[86:36]  and it hasn't come
[86:40] is it actually gonna be
[86:42] are we able gonna are we gonna be able
[86:44] to launch that app in a week
[86:50] I miss never tried for everybody
[86:55] oh hey Peter
[86:59] yeah Google login as an MVP could be
[87:01] right okay
[87:02] but even Google I think
[87:05] yeah you're right I think I'm gonna go
[87:07] with Google login my heading
[87:13] oh okay okay
[87:21] do you know Peter if I could get
[87:22] Firebase working with uh capacitor
[87:27] because capacitor is a bit different
[87:29] than just a typical native app as it's
[87:31] using a webview inside the app
[87:46] let me do a quick research making sure
[87:48] that's working
[88:08] okay yeah they have a cut
[88:11] they have this thing
[88:35] yes
[88:39] thank you GitHub this is not what I need
[88:41] right now
[89:04] all right Peter can I can I beg you with
[89:06] another question if assuming that he
[89:08] works with capacitor
[89:10] how I've never used Firebase I think I I
[89:13] know really roughly what it's for but
[89:16] would that work with the next JS API
[89:20] um
[89:21] feature is would be the simplest is to
[89:24] call nexgs Api features routes
[89:27] or tracking habits and creating stuff
[89:29] there's any like Firebase connection
[89:31] between those two that I can
[89:34] set up
[89:35] not not complicated
[89:56] okay okay
[89:58] and menu I think the the problem with
[90:00] capacitor and next oath is that next OS
[90:02] is web-based stuff
[90:05] and and usually web-based uh Things Are
[90:09] in capacitor will not be able to read
[90:12] the cookies that next oath
[90:14] creates from the authentication it means
[90:17] that the user will be authenticative
[90:20] authenticated but in a webview that is
[90:22] not the app
[90:24] which means that whenever the the guy
[90:26] calls the webview and come back to the
[90:27] app to do its own actions
[90:31] oh okay sorry sorry
[90:33] I think okay
[90:35] I think
[90:37] the link uh YouTube has probably nuke
[90:40] the link
[90:42] uh do you have do you have a
[90:45] Twitter or something we could talk to
[90:47] there because I don't know why they they
[90:49] don't allow links Maybe
[91:00] so I can send link but you cannot
[91:03] what is that uh maybe for spam or
[91:05] something
[91:07] okay
[91:10] all right
[91:17] okay
[91:55] welcome to Indonesia
[92:04] okay really it is forbidden in Indonesia
[92:06] so you have to use a VPN
[92:20] you use next oath Fair base
[92:24] no for now um I have no no ID so
[92:30] Firebase can end all the the oath
[92:34] yeah there's no requirement that the app
[92:36] is being made by you guys so uh it can
[92:39] be a 100 Firebase here
[93:06] oh
[93:29] I have it
[93:38] it's for so for the the main issue for
[93:41] now it would be the
[93:44] also
[93:46] yeah
[93:48] that's the thing is so the goal is to
[93:50] make it in a week
[93:51] and if I have to relearn to learn
[93:53] Firebase because I have no idea how
[93:55] Firebase works
[93:56] um if I have to learn Firebase I'm not
[93:58] sure I'm going to be able to stick to
[93:59] the goal of making it too weak and I'm
[94:01] going to lose some points and my
[94:02] character will shrink
[94:03] so
[94:05] um if I can use the minimal Firebase
[94:07] like just the authentication thing
[94:10] I think that would be the best because I
[94:13] would like to use the next GS API
[94:15] routes for the API stuff which I can
[94:18] easily connect to a mongodata mongodb
[94:20] database
[94:22] um I mean I'm used to this thick Stacks
[94:24] so it's going to take a a few minutes
[94:26] uh do you think there's a way I could
[94:30] you think I could just end all the
[94:32] authentication with Firebase
[94:36] I think so
[94:51] I don't know if there's a smart move
[94:52] sharing my
[94:54] yeah let me know when you copy the the
[94:56] email I will just remove it after
[94:59] it's a
[95:00] uh you never know what's happening in
[95:02] the internet
[95:16] I'm ready to fire up that that delete
[95:18] remove button I think I'm gonna do I
[95:21] think you just copied it
[95:22] okay
[95:26] okay okay Peter nice
[95:30]  my email uh is blown over all over
[95:33] all the internet so I'm gonna receive a
[95:34] lot of Bitcoins
[95:37] that I I earned from a
[95:40] students who cannot Withrow his it's
[95:42] Bitcoin and he needs my wallet
[95:46] all right
[95:47] um
[97:09] okay it's the
[97:12] um bathroom brick give me a second I'll
[97:14] be back
[102:28] hello again
[102:32] there we go quick toilet break and also
[102:36] very important life filthy
[102:43] a cave
[102:46] all right for everybody
[102:48] um
[102:48] tuning in we are building an app
[102:52] um that is going to help people build a
[102:55] workout Habits by having their own
[102:57] little Avatar that'll grow and Shrink
[102:58] based on their consistency on their
[103:00] goals
[103:02] um there's gonna be a live seven days
[103:04] um YouTube
[103:05] and I guess we are mostly Twitter people
[103:07] in here so hello Twitter
[103:10] um so far what we have in is the base
[103:16] thing uh that's how you have a tar will
[103:18] go with your cyclists
[103:21] um we are talking about the
[103:22] authentication and what you use I was
[103:25] also thinking about
[103:26] um something very important we are a
[103:29] startup
[103:30] a couple things I I believe
[103:43] yes
[103:45] okay
[104:03] oh yes
[104:12] all right I think I up I moved I
[104:15] turned on my VPN and that was a terrible
[104:17] idea
[104:19] but I think we're back okay we're back
[104:23] um
[104:23] so talking about the one of the most
[104:27] yeah yeah yeah
[104:29] it's okay yeah you would have guessed it
[104:31] without a stupid like just regular stuff
[104:33] that I do every day like turning on and
[104:35] on the VPN because in Indonesia you can
[104:37] you cannot use Reddit and things and and
[104:39] other stuff of course
[104:41] and uh yeah that's my first life ever so
[104:44] a couple mistakes anyway um a big big
[104:48] part
[104:49] um is the pricing of the app
[104:51] um so if you have any ID let me know
[104:55] um if we want to be able to start it
[104:57] somehow we have to make money
[104:59] and now you think
[105:01] um
[105:03] I think the app would be free to use
[105:07] you can create a couple workouts
[105:10] um let's say you cycle in your run
[105:12] I think we could we could do something
[105:14] like the first activity you do is free
[105:17] and if you want to set up another
[105:18] activity and be exactly n a runner
[105:22] then you would have to unlock some kind
[105:24] of Premium feature
[105:26] um
[105:27] I think subscriptions are a good
[105:29] business model but I
[105:31] I don't know I think
[105:33] also some kind of like subscription uh
[105:35] pane
[105:36] um
[105:37] sometimes it's just good you know to pay
[105:39] once to unlock something and then you
[105:41] have it forever
[105:44] and I think that would be a good fit for
[105:46] the app so you would have the free
[105:48] version of the app which is uh one
[105:50] workout
[105:51] Activity one Avatar
[105:53] if you want to have more you have a paid
[105:56] version of the app where you know for
[105:58] maybe 10 bucks or 20 bucks you unlock
[106:00] forever the app
[106:03] and then you can create a couple avatars
[106:06] and I was thinking
[106:08] um about reminders
[106:10] so you could receive a daily daily
[106:11] notifications that reminds you to
[106:13] complete your habit so you don't forget
[106:16] to actually tick and your avatar don't
[106:18] shrink and you don't miss your
[106:20] opportunity to get some experience
[106:22] points
[106:23] so maybe
[106:24] um features like uh notifications and a
[106:28] couple activities would be a page
[106:30] feature and it would be a package for
[106:31] like 19 you would unlock everything what
[106:34] you guys should think what do you guys
[106:36] think about that and if you like it how
[106:39] much do you think is a good price to
[106:41] unlock all the premium features for a
[106:44] lifetime deal no subscriptions
[106:53] foreign
[107:11] yeah
[107:13] it's very
[107:50] love it
[107:52] yeah I think if I get a user I can leave
[107:54] a
[107:55] one paying customer and uh I can leave
[107:57] one year in Valley with that at least I
[108:00] can renew my Vlog contract for a year
[108:02] and uh I know where to sleep for 12
[108:04] months be great
[108:06] oops
[108:24] oh yeah good points
[108:34] okay so maybe just
[108:36] unlock more activities
[108:38] for ninety dollars and by default you
[108:42] can have local notifications so I'll
[108:43] just remind you to kick it every day
[108:44] okay
[108:50] okay yeah this sounds pretty fun pretty
[108:53] cool
[108:54] uh
[108:56] I'm thinking about all the work that
[108:57] needs to be done in those seven days
[108:59] because we have the app we have the all
[109:01] authentication show that I've never done
[109:03] before
[109:04] we have all the design of all those
[109:06] emojis the leaderboards and everything
[109:08] uh we'll have
[109:10] all the launch assets the media the logo
[109:13] the picture a demo video for product
[109:16] ends
[109:17] and all the hustle with the app stores
[109:21] adding pricing uh
[109:25] seems like a lot of work we're gonna
[109:26] have to use Revenue cat I guess
[109:32] and that could be nice like yeah yeah
[109:34] in-app purchases like
[109:36] yeah that could be fun
[109:39] okay
[109:43] let me see really quickly how the thing
[109:45] works oh yeah I think I've seen that
[109:47] before
[109:52] yeah I think Manu is a nice article I
[109:54] think I read that before somehow for
[109:57] another project
[109:58] and and it was great but it just it
[110:01] looks like uh it's a bit of a hack
[110:04] I don't know if that's main like
[110:07] if that's something that's gonna work
[110:08] you know in six months and I feel like
[110:11] um
[110:13] I don't know I think I think I'm gonna
[110:15] try first with Firebase
[110:18] and then I'll move on to that thing if
[110:21] it does work
[110:26] there's this thing called Twitter life
[110:31] yeah Duolingo singer streak what there's
[110:33] a Twitter live no you're just kidding
[110:35] no way you can go live on Twitter
[110:41] you know where would that be
[110:42] it could actually be fun
[110:46] maybe OBS nose
[110:49] oh I have to chat in here
[111:20] okay well consider the the Twitter live
[111:22] later I'm gonna move on with that um and
[111:25] I think we're gonna jump straight into
[111:26] coding
[111:28] okay
[111:53] all right
[111:57] let me know what you think about the
[111:58] quality of the screen this is what I
[112:00] normally do when I encode but might be
[112:02] too small for you if it is let me know
[112:09] in it yep
[112:12] um
[112:19] how do we call that thing wait this is
[112:21] very important
[112:25] the name get the name guys incredible
[112:27] but I don't understand okay okay I'll
[112:28] try to grow the the screens like the
[112:30] face um how do we call that thing
[112:41] oh you okay okay so it's readable but
[112:43] you don't understand okay okay okay
[112:45] nice
[112:50] habit uh exercise Avatar
[112:57] let's do some brainstorming
[113:01]  I think it's because I'm not
[113:02] English native I don't know what school
[113:03] means
[113:07] oh you don't want to show me the
[113:09] dictionary okay
[113:15] oh okay
[113:18] oh both okay
[113:26] oh yeah okay I get it
[113:28] The Rock
[113:32] okay I think here we go here we go
[113:36] the product video for that thing it was
[113:38] gonna be a waste time conversation
[113:42] with The Rock
[113:46] oh yeah I'm gonna make him look to me
[113:48] over what's over what's up or FaceTime
[113:50] whatever and I'm gonna convince him to
[113:52] use the app there we go we get a product
[113:54] demo videos
[113:57] now we gotta find the name
[113:59] um
[114:02] we can even ask on Twitter
[114:04] after let's let's share some uh
[114:08] some ideas you guys have and I think
[114:10] I'll make a Twitter poll after that
[114:17] where was Deadpool
[114:19] okay grow workout Avatar and can I reply
[114:22] with no I cannot make another poll on
[114:23] that
[114:27] swarovatar
[114:47] that's good that's a good idea like that
[114:51] now
[114:57] hey it's gonna be I gotta admit it's
[114:59] gonna offend the bill the startups in
[115:01] public you guys give me uh so many good
[115:03] ideas
[115:09] I don't use much so I need a
[115:17] playground Maybe
[115:26] let me use
[115:31] maybe this
[115:34] okay
[115:50] exercising
[116:02] let's give it a try
[116:12] you were using it at the beginning age
[116:15] when um yeah just uh mostly Twitter I
[116:19] mean first it was looking at other
[116:21] people doing it on Twitter like video
[116:22] levels then I studied to build my own
[116:24] apps and
[116:27] um you know I built alone so sometimes
[116:29] it's a bit boring and I thought why not
[116:30] doing it on live on YouTube
[116:33] in a
[116:34] yeah team hero oh man yeah that's
[116:36] actually dope
[116:42] GPT is a king
[116:47] Solitaire Quest
[116:50] answer game hero oh yeah
[116:58] foreign
[117:00] Frenzy
[117:02] okay so we got to vote for gym hero
[117:05] what else what do you guys like happy
[117:06] hero I like happy hero happy hero team
[117:10] hero

[117:18] in general
[117:19] work out here
[117:26] I think the Hero part is really good I
[117:30] think we can keep that and refine it
[117:54] ah nice
[117:56] is it something no you made it up right
[117:58] Avatar right yeah cool
[118:02] and yeah no I didn't plan to make a
[118:05] course but
[118:07] I mean if you think that would be
[118:09] valuable for you I can definitely
[118:10] consider it yep
[118:16] I mean you guys are too creative
[118:19] what do we have in here dung
[118:22] okay I'm gonna have to reduce a little
[118:24] bit the phone Jim Genesis

[120:35] in 2021 no way
[120:43] that's cute
[120:51] we're getting a lot of names here if you
[120:53] guys tuning in please help us finding a
[120:56] name for that app
[120:58] an app where you have a workout Avatar
[121:00] that you grow
[121:08] to chichi
[121:15] premium
[121:18] okay
[121:44] give me something
[121:47] helium here
[122:10] yeah I I believe the app name should be
[122:16] about
[122:17] something workout exercise fit whatever
[122:20] and a game thing so fit quests or
[122:24] workout hero or
[122:26] I believe those those would work pretty
[122:29] well maybe
[122:31] uh
[122:34] request
[122:42] yep it works too
[122:49] right here
[122:51] oh
[123:03] it should be about sport more than sport
[123:05] hero
[123:11] a sweaty summary
[123:39] and it's true
[123:54] of course why not
[123:59] okay since I gotta keep it is fun
[124:01] workout Warrior
[124:03] work out Warrior
[124:10] habit hero
[124:11] workout hero
[124:25] to communicate
[124:33] Ah that's quite nice
[124:36] that's quite nice I don't know
[124:38] if people can relate if people have
[124:40] played the game The Final Fantasy feet
[124:50] World Witness
[125:00] the hero team hero
[125:16] about feet are bad that's a lot of oh
[125:19] maybe that's feet RPG
[125:28] so maybe people don't know what RPG is
[125:34] game
[125:38] I don't know why I keep going with the
[125:40] feet world because maybe because it's
[125:41] short
[125:43] let's think too is is it's easier
[125:46] sometimes you find me is that easier
[125:47] it's harder but it's better for people
[125:49] to remember when you find names that are
[125:51] short
[125:53] so in feet represents like you're when
[125:56] you say someone whose feet usually you
[125:58] it's easy to associate this with
[126:00] workouts so I feel like the word feet is
[126:03] very short three letters
[126:06] which is good and it represents somehow
[126:08] workouts that's why I'm having a little
[126:10] crush on the feed world
[126:14] how do we mix it feed game
[126:17] eight hero I like it maybe it's just me
[126:21] but there's nothing maybe we can do that
[126:24] which Peter say uh easier about the US
[126:33] because oh man that's cool
[126:38] because
[126:41] I think register two thousand
[126:44] nine or something
[126:46] 19 I think
[126:49] I'm praying nope
[126:52] easy
[126:54] TV even that yeah the app is not
[127:08] a great Quest Maybe
[127:15] oh wow liquid
[127:17] message was retracted
[127:25] games oh Dave
[127:27] yesquest workout or gym gears
[127:38] no way this is available
[127:44] at IO
[127:47] oh we're just twenty five thousand
[127:51] dollars knowing that the app will be
[127:52] about 10K per customers if we get three
[127:55] customers who are profitable so they
[127:57] might consider it
[128:15] all right
[128:17] maybe we can we can do we can explore
[128:19] something this way I think it needs to
[128:23] have
[128:25] hero or voice
[128:29] or game in the name and I think the
[128:33] other part needs other fits
[128:35] or
[128:38] um
[128:48] shape yeah
[129:29] Sharp
[129:45] what we're getting here
[129:46] um you guys said Health hero
[129:51] game fit
[129:54] brunch
[129:55] right
[130:00] have we tried all those let's see
[130:04] the domain names are
[130:07] kind to us
[130:09] I think the SEO won't matter much so we
[130:12] can go for something like ior app
[130:16] let's say racist
[130:20] yep
[130:22] maybe I oh
[130:23] [Music]
[130:30] we have a DOT code that is working so we
[130:33] can maybe highlight one game fit
[130:41] someone give me the price
[130:43] how many customers do you need to get
[130:45] for that
[130:50] yeah
[130:52] I know maybe
[130:54] all right this one's gonna be really
[130:56] hard okay game fit bye
[131:05] maybe we shouldn't bother maybe we
[131:07] should just go
[131:08] again with a simple one uh maybe it
[131:10] seems like defeat hero seems to be the
[131:12] most liked because anyway at the end
[131:15] it's an app it's gonna be an app it's
[131:17] gonna be on the stores
[131:18] so maybe
[131:21] maybe it doesn't matter
[131:23] just
[131:24] App Store
[131:26] it's zero
[131:30] some people have been doing a lively for
[131:32] us oh that's the app we talked about
[131:41] this is what we're trying to build
[131:46] Ace of feet hero is taken and they are
[131:50] it here
[132:03] as it looks cool
[132:12] but actually what do you think I think
[132:13] feed her off it's pretty well
[132:19] right there
[132:23] going back to uh
[132:26] when we're teenagers those uh amazing
[132:29] games we played
[132:34] oh you cannot share the okay that's why
[133:04] I spent all my monthly recurring Revenue
[133:06] in that in this one
[133:25] okay
[133:32] games
[133:35] here of it oh herofit
[133:40] wait wait we get something here feed
[133:42] hero.games it's a weird I know premium
[133:45] okay thanks
[133:53] of course
[134:18] 2021
[134:20] again
[134:23] we heard a call and maybe IO
[134:53] you repeat the GG
[134:59] Health hero hero
[135:09] it's something in here
[135:11] eat hero I'm never gonna get it
[135:14] support hero maybe you can try something
[135:15] like this
[135:17] three
[135:21] that's why this is the worst oh main
[135:24] extension we can think of
[135:28] um
[135:29] we have the X Y Z
[135:34] I was spending too much time on the
[135:35] domain we gotta designed uh sport hero
[135:38] that app we have the sport hero
[135:40] it's not bad
[135:45] really simple
[135:47] or six percent quarter nine characters
[135:53] not bad at all
[135:55] uh has to be crazy
[136:01] of course
[136:07] zero I think it's very nice
[136:13] okay no need crunch eight
[136:21] Maybe
[136:29] okay this one is crazy
[136:36] Quest
[136:38] but
[136:50] adventure maybe
[136:52] a bit long but
[136:58] I think that's oh
[137:01] I assuming this maybe it was just really
[137:03] do yeah yep I think I'll just leave it
[137:06] as public on my channel
[137:11] Adventure
[137:14] yeah okay we got something in here too
[137:31] Adventure Health hero
[137:35] Health hero
[137:36] yeah
[137:40] maybe we do a Twitter poll
[137:42] you guys I'll send you the link
[137:48] we see what people think
[137:50] and we move on
[137:53] so at the end I think it doesn't really
[137:54] matter because we can uh
[137:56] it's just a number it's it's gonna be an
[137:58] abso
[138:04] Alex
[138:06] uh exercise

[138:48] all right let's try this
[138:57] Emoji here
[139:01] the only thing my name is if we go this
[139:03] way and one day the app is working well
[139:06] and we want to change the pictures
[139:09] the
[139:10] Ruby sandwiches
[139:13] we won't be able to do that
[139:16] once you see her sorry I think we give

[139:24] all right you know what I'm gonna add
[139:25] something like Emoji at the end oh no
[139:28] I'm limited to four choices

[139:37] it's for hero okay anyway we're gonna
[139:40] give it a try like this
[139:47] [Music]
[139:49] and I'm sending you the links
[139:52] there you go
[140:25] yeah exactly the time is it for the
[140:26] brainstorming yeah
[140:28] I'm thinking all the things we have to
[140:29] do and I'm like it seems never could
[140:31] happen that's one um we have the name
[140:35] we're gonna wait a little bit hero feet
[140:37] okay it seems like
[140:39] oh
[140:40] eating let's see
[140:43] next
[140:53] I'm gonna do some boring work but I have
[140:54] to set up the repo and all those stuff
[140:56] [Music]
[140:57] um
[140:58] and I called it
[141:03] we
[141:24] nope

[142:08] hey
[142:10] um Halloween
[142:13] Express
[142:52] oh yeah that's next okay
[142:55] maybe we don't care about that
[142:59] we don't care
[143:01] how do I do this everything
[143:05] foreign
[143:11] bye bye
[143:25] um Daisy UI
[143:29] all right so I'm setting up the the
[143:30] project with the basic components
[143:33] um
[143:34] we have these UI
[143:47] there's an issue here I mean
[143:50] oh okay
[144:02] [Music]
[144:04] normally we should be up and running if
[144:07] we do this
[144:11] is it
[144:34] oh I finally saw what I love absolutely
[144:37] love it uh I think it's aerobic
[144:44] now it's a bit it's a bit of a bold move
[144:46] I'm trying I'm just setting up the
[144:48] phones which doesn't make much sense but
[144:50] I really love that font I found it
[144:51] recently for her project
[144:54] I think I'm gonna start building with it
[144:59] make it
[145:02] um
[145:07] we have this I'm also setting up
[145:10] um a few things for the capacitor app so
[145:15] at some point the app will be available
[145:16] on mobile and it needs to have like some
[145:18] stuff in the viewport
[145:21] make sure that it looks good on iOS and
[145:23] everything
[145:27] some reason basically what I use for
[145:29] previous projects
[145:31] so I don't have to rethink everything
[145:33] okay that then we're gonna use the any
[145:37] Dart for phone
[145:40] um
[146:06] okay
[146:22] I've been here yep
[146:26] card
[146:33] okay
[146:37] that and move it there
[146:41] almost
[147:00] all right that's a bit boring almost
[147:02] done
[147:12] see if we get something to work
[147:19] this is not working
[147:21] I'm gonna remove all that
[147:25] hello
[147:27] okay
[147:29] we are all set
[147:44] thing first
[147:52] and go
[147:55] okay
[148:03] Oh Oh I thought you were in France menu
[148:05] I was like it's already late for you
[148:07] okay good night man
[148:09] see you tomorrow
[148:16] and we never actually I am full
[148:19] screening here
[148:21] it's just a
[148:23] maybe because of the notch it doesn't
[148:25] look like I have full screen but if I
[148:26] show here see
[148:28] can I go beyond that
[148:32] does it go on Twitter
[148:36] okay hero fit seems to be the winner
[148:38] please please do not buy aerofit
[148:42] otherwise you're and I need to
[148:44] start everything again
[148:54] choose Twitter
[148:56] very fun
[148:59] but as a hero feed was available I know
[149:01] it was maybe the i o oh
[149:03] [Music]
[149:07] which one did I
[149:10] zero feet
[149:11] oh the GG
[149:13] and the one we found
[149:25] yeah yeah and I think I'm gonna ask you
[149:27] all to give me your Twitter in in the
[149:29] landing page at the bottom I'm gonna put
[149:31] all your names in there for your
[149:32] contribution
[149:33] like kind of like a movie trailer where
[149:35] at the end at the movie at the end of
[149:36] the movie where you have the list of all
[149:38] the the credits
[150:09] the guy is everywhere as soon as you
[150:11] type SEO you see that base
[150:14] SEO person
[150:44] all right so I guess you're a American
[150:46] time zone as well
[150:48] oh yeah okay I guess it can can be
[150:50] pretty late okay thanks man it was so
[150:52] fun thanks for staying alone like uh
[150:54] nope he had a nice live movie and uh
[150:57] I'll see you tomorrow I'll share the
[150:59] links on Twitter when I whenever I
[151:00] change this room
[151:42] alone I didn't even know this was a
[151:46] thing
[151:57] what just happened why I thought it was
[151:59] like at six dollars and now he went to
[152:01] 60. did you guys like the domain or
[152:04] something
[152:13] nine dollars
[152:19] I think I might do something like just
[152:20] like this hero feed me
[152:27] as you said
[152:29] oh actually all the Gingy dummies are
[152:31] quite expensive
[153:31] I'm gonna do we're gonna set up
[153:33] capacitor
[153:34] in the meantime capacitor
[153:40] okay
[153:43] so if you are new to capacitor this is a
[153:48] whatever framework or something a
[153:49] library that helps you transform your
[153:52] HTML websites into a native mobile app
[153:56] that's what I'm going to use to shape
[153:57] the app on the stores
[154:08] I already have the key
[154:17] except we're also going to do this
[154:22] a little type so I can hear
[154:33] nice this is going well
[154:37] it's difficult
[155:04] wait tap in it
[155:06] yep
[155:08] um
[155:09] right
[155:12] I think it's kind of cold
[156:03] there's energy read so
[156:06] so basically what it does is it adds um
[156:09] this command ads these folders
[156:13] nope nope nope
[156:16] okay those are the pictures okay and now
[156:18] okay I needed the packages now I had IOS
[156:20] and Android you will see that in here
[156:23] this is basically the Android app
[156:26] um I have no idea how to read those
[156:28] files
[156:29] but uh what's going to happen is I'm
[156:32] going to export my next CS app to HTML
[156:35] CSS and JS files and capacitor will add
[156:40] it to this Repository
[156:41] and I can just add it to my uh
[156:45] xcode and I have an app
[156:49] generator assistant
[156:51] oh Yep this is where next GS come in
[156:56] um
[157:00] same again I'm going to copy a few
[157:02] comments
[157:03] stuff that I use for other projects I'm
[157:05] going to add to this one
[157:09] uh it's a basically simple stuff so if
[157:11] you're using nexus.js this thing here
[157:14] next export
[157:16] is going to turn the next JS project
[157:18] into basic HTML CSS files and stuff
[157:21] and then cap copy will put them in the
[157:25] correct folders or Android and iOS so I
[157:27] have the app ready
[157:30] um
[157:36] oh yeah I need that thing
[157:39] of directory out
[158:00] okay next
[158:08] of course
[158:11] and
[158:12] um
[158:15] right so for next next yes won't
[158:19] allow you to build a next server inside
[158:21] of the app so you need a few things to
[158:23] disable disable so for instance image
[158:26] optimization will not work when I build
[158:28] the app so I have to disable it
[158:31] and also if I want to be able to call
[158:33] the next slash API routes for the API
[158:35] then I need to allow course
[158:38] stuff headers on on the calls
[158:42] so then the app can communicate with the
[158:45] next.js API
[158:49] and we need iOS
[158:52] I think it's just a webview yeah I'm not
[158:54] super familiar with exactly how that
[158:56] works behind it but Norm if I understand
[158:58] well yes it's a it's basically a webview
[159:00] you have 100 of years of the screen on
[159:02] the device
[159:03] and then you put all your HTML files
[159:05] inside of it the Germany yeah we're
[159:08] gonna do a little sync
[159:10] and I think I should be able to show you
[159:12] how that looks
[159:14] um
[159:17] okay so the setup is done
[159:20] find the web
[159:22] uh yep maybe because I haven't started
[159:25] building it yet so what I'm going to do
[159:26] is I'm gonna get npm run mobile
[159:30] so that comments is the one I just added
[159:32] here it's a shortcut but basically it's
[159:34] gonna build the next year's project it's
[159:36] going to export it into the out folder
[159:38] which is this one and in here you have
[159:40] all my HTML pages so the entry page the
[159:43] index one the 444 a few stuff
[159:48] this is my website and then cap copy
[159:51] will put all those files as you see here
[159:53] could be always compete web and
[159:54] everything you'll put them somewhere in
[159:56] IOS and Android
[159:57] here if I do an mpm npx
[160:04] yeah open
[160:07] iOS
[160:09] it should open the projects somewhere
[160:12] Onyx code
[160:14] in here
[160:16] oh I might need to install the pose
[160:19] to come and forget
[160:21] and this is not gonna work right
[160:24] yeah of course
[160:27] um
[160:36] yeah I mean I I've heard of I think it's
[160:38] a it's a good it's a good framework but
[160:41] uh if I'm not mistaken you have to
[160:43] relearn like it's a whole new language
[160:45] by itself right
[161:10] okay okay
[161:16] yeah I've been I've been a bit lazy and
[161:18] I used that just so I get it running as
[161:23] soon as I can
[161:24] and um and yeah it's for now it's
[161:27] working pretty well I don't know what
[161:28] the performance are compared to react
[161:30] native I'm pretty sure it's that it
[161:31] cannot be as good as react native
[161:34] but at least it's really fast to ship
[161:36] apps
[161:52] I think it's gonna be updated maybe he's
[161:54] gonna put inside okay
[161:56] pad
[161:58] I'm gonna use the typical iPhone
[162:03] nice
[162:17] there's a container SIM card here
[162:19] repeats oh okay
[162:30] actually why
[162:36] oh yeah I called up and not oh maybe
[162:39] it's because I mean
[163:41] that's the the issue with
[163:45] capacitor is that I have no idea how
[163:48] each code works
[163:50] I'm slowly trying to understand why it's
[163:53] called app it's
[164:18] okay working
[164:30] yep at the start yeah that's true
[164:36] and we have we should have normally a
[164:38] simulators that he's hiding somewhere
[164:47] where are you oh there you go
[164:50] yeah and there we go we have the upper
[164:52] here ready
[164:54] ah
[164:56] that's uh I need to do some work but
[164:58] that's basically where the app lives
[165:00] it's called herofit in here
[165:04] and uh yeah it sounds simulator so
[165:07] here we go
[165:10] we're pretty much set up
[165:18] uh
[165:20] [Music]
[165:40] oh
[165:42] a little quick check before you go to
[165:44] bed
[165:45] um no I think the issue is fixed as uh
[165:47] was an issue with the name naming of the
[165:49] app because I think I changed the name
[165:50] of the app a little bit at the wrong
[165:52] time
[165:52] to be working now we have the up warning
[165:54] and the simulator
[165:57] uh we have the printing on the web
[166:00] and now we have to think
[166:04] so the name the domain name what do we
[166:07] buy
[166:11] healthy Rose seems to be working well
[166:13] too
[167:21] nice
[167:29] so basically that's the only the GG
[167:32] domain that are
[167:36] otherwise hero it's up
[167:45] dang
[167:52] it's like yeah
[168:18] it's awful it's never gonna work out
[168:26] because the Wi-Fi dead no no way
[168:31] okay now the Wi-Fi is not dead
[169:57] give me a second I'll be right back
[172:57] oh maybe
[173:01] what's up
[173:03] hello
[173:51] that's not the best domain name but
[173:56] the hero feed that app maybe that could
[173:57] be the one
[174:18] superhero
[175:07] yeah
[175:08] of course
[175:19] we're gonna go with this one
[175:21] here here honey
[175:24] I'm thinking
[175:26] move on
[175:31] a year or to rain you my privacy
[175:34] [Music]
[175:43] thing
[175:50] is that phone
[175:53] I'll be right back
[176:25] we are buying domain names and we're
[176:27] gonna put something on this it's not
[176:30] gonna be just talking on it
[177:40] you're good
[178:05] done yep
[178:26] we're adding the domain name
[178:36] it's really seriously no no way
[178:38] let's play qualified for don't leave me
[178:45] oh okay
[178:59] creating the domain name to versa
[179:01] we were able to serve the API in landing
[179:05] page from there
[179:32] a name
[179:54] here we're gonna let it think
[179:56] for a little while
[179:58] come back later
[180:00] um something top of mind we have to do
[180:02] we can get rid of this
[180:04] pages
[180:10] uh we can
[180:13] something like this booms
[180:18] because we're going to knead it at some
[180:20] point in terms of services something
[180:22] really basic uh here of faith
[180:30] it's pretty much all but we
[180:36] have to have a page like this so we're
[180:38] going to set up a slash privacy and
[180:40] slashed us for the stores for later
[180:44] right
[180:47] well they see
[180:56] you know
[181:08] maybe we should have something like
[181:10] the services in here wow here we go
[181:21] there okay we have the domain name and
[181:24] normally
[181:25] it
[181:27] here
[181:32] that might take a little while
[181:38] first let's okay
[181:41] hopefully Twitter didn't change its mind
[181:48] okay let's go over there here perfect
[181:51] close this as well
[181:57] should we pin the chat somewhere
[181:59] about shift oh
[182:30] that's responsibility
[182:32] anyway please I can see who I can say
[182:55] right we're gonna build some boring
[182:57] stuff today
[182:58] uh
[183:00] I think we're gonna have to go with
[183:03] the authentication so we're gonna need
[183:06] uh signings on a page
[183:09] login
[183:13] and
[183:15] page
[183:18] opponents uh check
[184:15] there we go
[184:20] and I found a sign up you're gonna need
[184:22] Google
[184:29] um and we gotta sign up with an email
[184:30] address as well so
[184:42] oh maybe we can reuse the one from
[184:43] habit's card and then
[184:55] sign up
[184:57] yes
[185:04] email
[185:17] code
[186:10] this is a bit boring at the beginning
[186:12] but basically I'm going to set up the
[186:17] um just an empty
[186:19] shell in the app no slide no design no
[186:22] no copywriting nothing just functional
[186:29] in case we need the password
[186:33] there we go
[187:21] and oh yeah we need a four
[187:31] sign up
[187:54] you'll sit
[187:58] still
[188:06] nice
[188:10] um password
[188:19] we got a console mode all that
[188:27] bird
[188:30] I'm trying to stay to value and a
[188:31] function
[188:33] yep I know that
[188:36] if there's another vehicle
[188:46] ah okay you want that thing
[188:50] you go
[188:52] up here
[188:55] space
[189:00] or
[189:02] and we're gonna need a button for the
[189:05] submission
[189:06] type
[189:09] submit
[189:13] sign up
[189:18] work
[189:20] but then
[189:26] bottom block
[189:30] Bingo there's no yep
[189:42] you're supposed to log my stuff no
[189:45] Maybe
[189:58] okay you're working
[190:01] um on change
[190:04] set email
[190:07] e
[190:08] that email
[190:11] you don't want
[190:14] I don't want to go to complete okay
[190:16] need the target
[190:20] value
[190:28] um
[190:44] nope
[190:50] right
[190:53] change you as well save the password
[191:04] who is doing that
[191:26] there we go
[191:49] where the fund comes in
[193:29] are now in my living room
[193:41] let me know how the Sun is
[194:41] I don't know if you can
[194:47] okay
[194:50] I don't get
[194:56] okay only
[194:59] probably nobody is hearing this doesn't
[195:02] matter
[195:11] right
[196:37] there's anyone in the life and you would
[196:39] like me to
[196:41] press what I'm thinking
[196:43] you know the process of Designing the
[196:45] app let me know otherwise I think I'm
[196:47] just alone on the stream so uh I'll just
[196:49] be normal me and just
[196:53] let me know if you want me to raise my
[196:54] uh
[201:27] foreign
[201:50] I'm making an app where you can show up
[201:53] workouts pick your habit and you grow an
[201:56] avatar that represents you so if you're
[201:57] cycling you're gonna have the cyclist
[201:59] emoji
[202:00] and um yo girl
[202:02] if you don't show up it'll shrink and
[202:04] you can see people who are doing the
[202:06] same workout as you basically that would
[202:09] look like so
[202:12] get experience things
[202:15] uh yeah they have people hear of it
[202:21] uh seven days
[202:44] okay so we are saving the auth token in
[202:48] the local storage I have no idea that's
[202:50] good or not that's what we're gonna do
[202:51] for now we need to generate a notebook
[202:55] the back end
[202:57] I've done this once in the past
[203:01] uh hopefully you find the code
[204:34] it's gonna work
[205:06] here
[205:11] announcers
[206:07] requesting the best
[206:16] all right that's where the pun
[206:18] boring before it comes in
[206:22] principles
[206:28] it's email phone
[206:31] do we care
[206:51] I'm gonna change it
[207:14] I'm gonna create enough token
[207:25] save the user
[207:38] needs to be done things
[208:10] of
[208:15] I'm gonna read
[208:16] I use for my other app
[208:19] I'm gonna use Mongoose or database and
[208:21] for the
[208:37] weekends
[208:46] represents
[208:49] YouTube
[208:54] significantly
[209:47] how I've been doing things for other
[209:49] apps and uh I just sometimes I just
[209:51] don't think and I just use the code I
[209:52] use because it's working
[209:54] so I hope your pets in
[210:04] older
[211:21] okay so we have a model
[211:23] tokens we're going to save which are
[211:25] going to be access tokens
[211:28] need to
[211:34] move
[211:37] we need to have a library that's going
[211:39] to
[211:43] transfer
[211:44] surveys
[211:53] didn't create
[212:20] oh that's what you should
[212:23] okay anyway it's too late
[212:36] God damn it all right I'm gonna have to
[212:38] screaming and just
[212:40] delete my
[217:14] back
[217:17] resistor intake token
[217:21] the joy of building
[217:23] your screen
[217:27] we have
[217:29] um
[217:30] the hero
[217:32] is live now the DNS is working
[217:37] hey Google lower
[217:59] we're going to connect to the local
[218:00] database
[223:17] right hey welcome back
[223:19] I was just deleting all my uh
[223:24] visiting all my API opens that I uh
[223:27] working here on YouTube
[223:31] um
[223:33] anyway
[223:36] um so
[223:38] connecting the app to the local database
[223:41] for now
[223:42] for this
[223:44] for another app as well
[223:55] yes
[225:43] foreign
[226:40] that little thing where's Nick Jr so
[227:07] our sign up you have the response
[227:10] get something
[228:22] oh I think I'm
[228:48] oh okay yeah
[228:59] we've connected API in again
[229:07] maybe we eat
[229:10] yeah maybe we
[229:56] out
[230:08] maybe the Boris
[230:11] they're going to eat with me
[230:40] foreign
[232:03] foreign
[235:23] hey maybe you hear me better now I think
[235:26] I was I was actually not talking at all
[235:27] I was just preparing the the meal
[235:30] here
[235:40] is it better now
[235:46] oh okay okay okay got it yeah
[235:49] I think yeah it was a beach bar from I'm
[235:51] like
[235:52] there we go you're coming in for the
[235:55] lunch break
[236:00] it's a friendly uh it's a really
[236:02] building Public public uh everything in
[236:05] public life
[237:15] I'm having a little lunch break so
[237:17] you're uh you're coming in at the right
[237:19] time
[244:48] Andre some pork eggs omelets and a bunch
[244:53] of vegetables and rice
[244:54] so
[244:56] maybe I can shoot she's cooking
[245:00] it would basically
[245:03] prepare all those boxes
[245:09] should we put everything in boxes and
[245:11] then that's the equivalent of a launch
[245:12] in a dealer for two percent
[245:17] works well so I can I can go back and
[245:19] build more soon
[245:37] which entry are you from Twitter
[245:55] yeah okay this one yeah
[245:58] I could have guessed with your emoji I
[246:01] wasn't going man how is the outgoing
[247:02] oh bro that's so nice that's super nice
[247:05] here
[247:08] is that enough to make a living where
[247:10] you're you're from
[247:49] oh okay oh man that's so cool and
[247:53] you plan on on quitting your job when
[247:56] you're done with with this when when she
[247:58] makes enough money and what is your job
[248:01] by the way
[249:26] uh bro let's go
[250:08] Congressman I think there's in the eye
[250:10] for that it's such a good project I was
[250:12] really blown by the the design was
[250:15] really beautiful and felt like you have
[250:17] a sense
[251:34] right
[251:35] how can someone hate it
[251:40] that they hate the purpose of the Apple
[251:43] they hate the design of it
[253:31] my name
[253:52] I think when you reach the point you you
[253:54] you're already high enough to uh not
[253:56] care it's a good man
[253:59] yeah I mean yeah I've seen I've seen it
[254:01] it's true it feels different but I think
[254:04] the whole AI thing is a new stuff and
[254:07] that makes sense to have space for
[254:08] Outsiders like like your app
[254:11] personally I love it man so nice but I I
[254:14] can imagine Google doesn't like it much
[254:16] as well for the the contrast thing
[254:20] I don't know what's the score the
[254:21] lighthouse core but I'm pretty sure they
[254:23] won't like it much either
[254:26] but I think it's it's generous how do
[254:28] you I'm curious how do you how come
[254:31] how come you do you have any inspiration
[254:34] for that because that's very unique it's
[254:36] it feels like you
[254:39] it's like it feels almost like an artist
[254:40] made it how do you how do you come up
[254:42] with those designs
[256:16] oh okay so oh that's cool
[256:31] wait you're getting there bro
[256:33] I think your app whatever you talk about
[256:35] AI you have to come and end up coming up
[256:38] on the table
[256:40] such a yeah really such a good design
[256:42] yeah very unique
[256:44] did you build on other apps before that
[256:49] you know like uh
[256:50] to see your your signature
[257:03] I think you cannot share a link on the
[257:05] chat but um
[257:08] if you if you DM me on Twitter I'd love
[257:11] to look at your other apps man
[258:10] I don't know
[258:12] did you learn do you know it somewhere
[258:14] or is it just
[258:17] whatever and you come up with something
[259:52] damn it
[260:48] I think it I speak closer to it it's a
[260:51] bit better right it's just it's kind of
[260:52] like a
[260:53] my building break and uh
[260:57] I cannot put the mic too close to the
[260:59] palette
[261:15] I would I was curious whether you
[261:17] learned design somewhere or if it's just
[261:20] you
[261:21] um you know being creative and doing
[261:23] stuff and and it's for us just because
[261:26] it looks really nice it looks like a
[261:28] actually a personal designer made this I
[261:31] would I would love to know what's the
[261:32] journey to get there
[263:41] so you're like
[263:44] there's no process like real process
[263:46] behind it just like you try a few things
[263:48] and you see how that looks you improve
[263:50] you assess and make it better
[263:53] it's like a proper from scratch uh thing
[263:55] cool
[264:55] and which time zone are you bro
[265:01] which time zone are you
[265:20] nice
[265:25] early bird
[265:36] yo Dave uh going well somehow just
[265:39] having a little lunch break for now
[265:41] casual lunch and I'll be back at it in a
[265:44] few minutes
[266:00] belly Indonesia so it's like a 1 1 pm
[266:03] now
[267:03] uh-huh
[267:09] time to hit the better
[267:47] yeah basically it's um it's a local
[267:50] person
[267:52] and I found her on asking on a Facebook
[267:54] group
[267:55] um and she used to cook for restaurants
[267:57] but she's uh somehow I retired she's
[267:59] like 50 something
[268:01] and um she works independently it's not
[268:04] a business it's just one-on like
[268:05] freelance
[268:07] um we pay her per week and she goes she
[268:10] prepares the meal plans on the weekends
[268:12] we at the very beginning we sent her
[268:15] some pictures of things we like like
[268:16] what kind of food do we want to eat
[268:17] sweet like no oil for instance
[268:21] um we try to have some proteins a bit
[268:23] every day lots of vegetables some beans
[268:27] and we just we just tell we just tell
[268:30] her like we wanted to eat these kind of
[268:32] things
[268:33] and um and she prepares meal plan so she
[268:35] used the ingredients to tell her to cook
[268:36] and she would create like whatever
[268:38] sometimes tacos sometimes Indonesian
[268:41] food uh sometimes she'll make a salad or
[268:43] something
[268:44] then she will do groceries usually on
[268:46] the weekend or on Monday she'll come
[268:48] drop everything in the fridge and then
[268:49] every day she'll come two hours and cook
[268:51] for lunch and dinner uh she'll pack some
[268:54] food for the dinner because she comes in
[268:56] the morning and everything is ready for
[268:58] the dinner too
[269:00] and just we reheat the food at night and
[269:03] we pick you know from the boxes and and
[269:05] we eat whatever she made
[269:07] and she's a there's a they're really
[269:09] easy peasy here so they
[269:12] there's something you don't like or if
[269:13] you want to change something you can
[269:15] just tell her like you know for next
[269:16] week change something and then oh this
[269:19] easy is like kind of like a friend
[269:21] working with you
[269:25] and uh the cost of living in Bali
[269:28] no not really uh I think
[269:31] I was always attracted by southeast Asia
[269:33] for some reason because I think it's uh
[269:35] unique and different from what I know
[269:37] from from Europe I'm from Paris
[269:40] and uh belly came on the map because
[269:42] it's uh it's it's very it's hot it's
[269:45] beautiful
[269:46] um people are super kind and I surf in
[269:49] this here it's just so good for the surf
[269:52] so that's pretty much how about you come
[269:54] in mind and actually that was my wife
[269:55] who wanted to come in here and I was
[269:57] like no it's too touristy and things and
[269:59] since we moved here we actually loved it
[270:16] I don't know I mean Dave I'm not sure if
[270:18] I understand but yeah it's uh it's just
[270:20] a MacBook Pro so I can just move it
[270:22] around and I have a the whole setup is
[270:24] OBS and this mic and that's the only
[270:27] thing I have
[270:59] yeah
[271:00] oh I see you
[271:02] now I've been uh sometimes I wish I had
[271:05] an extra money tour but I've been
[271:06] working on the Mac and it's quite
[271:07] convenient
[271:08] then I can work in different areas in
[271:11] the house
[271:12] oh and if I if I go back to my country
[271:15] France and I can just bring my work with
[271:17] me without having carrying the monitor
[271:28] um
[271:31] how big are they usually
[271:33] I guess it's a okay so like not that big
[271:36] right it's more like a
[271:38] it's like a second screen right
[272:54] everything
[273:21] foreign
[274:14] dragged me there at the time
[274:17] but I think it's a good place to travel
[274:19] when you're alone here so many young
[274:21] people
[274:22] and so many guest houses it's so easy to
[274:25] make friends
[274:36] all right a quick coffee and we are back
[274:37] to building
[285:12] all right we're back Buffy's ready lunch
[285:16] done
[285:18] AC on we're ready for another afternoon
[285:21] of coding
[285:24] um if you're tuning in we are building a
[285:26] mini startup in a week
[285:28] uh the startup is called hero feeds it's
[285:31] gonna be a workout app where you can
[285:33] track your progress and it grows a Emoji
[285:36] Avatar
[285:37] and it shrinks if you don't show up if
[285:39] you don't stick to your goals
[285:41] and you're gonna have a little board
[285:43] with all the people that do similar
[285:45] workouts as you and uh and yeah so you
[285:48] can play with friends or just random
[285:49] people and compete against them on who's
[285:52] the most consistent
[285:54] so what we have so far
[285:58] this this thing that's the app
[286:00] uh it's connected to the API which is
[286:04] using HCS API folder
[286:07] um because it's gonna be it's gonna be a
[286:08] mobile app built with capacitor I need
[286:10] to implement a gwg
[286:14] um token from scratch so basically
[286:17] trading tokens on the back end sending
[286:20] them back to the front end clients
[286:22] and uh using them to authenticate
[286:24] authenticate the user
[286:28] um I have no idea how that's gonna work
[286:31] I'm gonna try something
[286:37] all right so for now we have these
[286:39] routes called sign up
[286:42] um so now I need to create the token
[286:44] I have
[286:46] um some code from other apps like habits
[286:49] Garden where I was using the similar
[286:51] Tech stuck so I might do some copy past
[286:54] from time to time
[286:56] in
[286:57] here we need to create a token so
[287:00] we had something called
[287:03] token controller
[287:07] post controller Maybe
[287:15] um
[287:17] okay that's what we need a token that's
[287:19] serviced it
[287:27] every token
[287:31] maybe we'll need a library
[287:35] it's okay but are we using okay I need
[287:38] this
[287:40] in the moment
[287:42] we're using moment
[287:44] uh we don't care about that moment in
[287:47] Facebook
[288:32] okay okay
[288:35] well we don't really need it
[288:47] here
[289:19] give me a second I'm just setting up
[289:23] this thing
[290:01] welcome back
[290:04] let me see
[291:32] generated safe token
[291:34] uh type we're gonna
[291:44] give them type
[292:04] and give me in the Olympic Beauty
[292:10] okay let's find one you can type
[292:20] oh maybe I can do
[292:31] third ID
[293:01] 30 days
[293:12] uh refresh
[293:16] oh that's true
[294:05] go back
[294:07] holes okay
[294:25] okay
[294:29] use this a bit after
[294:36] 30 days for the access token
[294:49] existed
[294:54] refresh.com
[294:59] 30 days
[295:04] anyway I have no idea if I'm doing the
[295:06] right thing
[295:20] okay
[295:21] and generate password reset token we
[295:24] don't need it for now
[295:27] very email verified we don't need it
[295:32] check check
[295:34] uh
[296:05] generate oh it's okay
[296:23] all right no it's not right it is no
[296:26] it's not
[297:00] users how users are gonna be
[297:05] this is the model we use for users so
[297:07] basically someone's signing up for an
[297:08] account will have this model set up
[297:11] um
[297:13] we're gonna replace these by user
[297:23] Shima
[297:27] user equal model
[297:32] up
[297:34] into users needs
[297:37] I'll say that they need an email to sign
[297:39] up
[297:47] require a trip
[297:52] um
[297:54] eventually they can have a password
[297:57] they want to
[298:08] stream through minimum names eight uh
[298:15] okay
[298:17] um
[298:19] username at some point we'll set up a
[298:21] username which uh
[298:23] we have type string and it's gonna be
[298:27] it's not required
[298:31] we need
[298:34] then we're gonna have a later on a list
[298:36] of sports that the user does
[298:39] which are going to be objects type
[298:45] you reference other collection
[298:51] riff
[298:52] oh yeah that's it
[298:59] object ID required
[299:04] and
[299:05] reference to for the model Sports
[299:12] when you have an user when you connect
[299:14] with the mongodbit database
[299:18] um
[299:20] we're going to have a library as well to
[299:22] create users
[299:27] I'm going to import our model which is a
[299:33] user
[299:46] slash
[299:51] create transfer
[299:54] uh
[300:00] we are going to need an email
[300:04] and a password
[300:12] gonna be async
[300:23] assistant
[300:25] user equal
[300:29] wait user
[300:34] I think so
[300:36] I'm going to create email and password
[300:42] current user
[300:45] words
[300:52] save that we're gonna go back in here
[300:56] and also can leave slash
[301:01] and we are going to need this one too
[301:04] user
[301:12] um
[301:19] and we're gonna try to do this thing
[301:24] um
[301:24] [Music]
[301:33] does it have an email
[301:50] request dot buddy
[301:54] an email then we are going to
[301:56] you can connect to the database
[301:58] afterward then we're gonna wait for
[302:00]  and we are going to do constant is
[302:04] equal weights user no that's uh
[302:10] buddy
[302:12] email
[302:20] uh
[302:23] applicants
[302:27] tokens and we need to pass on
[302:36] let me see we have an app with a privacy
[302:38] policy it's definitely going to be a
[302:40] success a massive success
[302:44] now I'll sign up here we go and here
[302:46] here here here we need
[302:52] very generous of token I just need the
[302:54] user okay
[302:55] so I need to do user okay
[303:00] Stitcher I'm gonna send you like the
[303:02] user and the token
[303:06] all right fingers crossed
[303:13] sorry I was a bit off coding uh yes I'm
[303:15] building the oath from the ground up
[303:17] because the app is going to be using
[303:18] capacitor and uh I cannot use things
[303:21] like next oath as it's putting cookies
[303:23] in the web browser we're not in
[303:25] capacitor so yep ground up for the
[303:29] Authentication
[303:37] and uh yeah Victor uh
[303:40] I don't know it's usually with the
[303:41] feeling I use Daisy UI which is very
[303:44] nice uh
[303:46] looks like that
[303:49] it's uh it's a library of UI component
[303:51] they have all those components and more
[303:52] they're pretty cool they fit most of my
[303:54] design
[303:56] and then based on that I built around
[303:59] that thing
[304:00] um I'm not a really good I'm actually a
[304:02] really terrible designer
[304:04] I just uh I use that thing to get
[304:06] inspired
[304:09] all right now we can finger crossed it
[304:11] cannot work for the first time but still
[304:13] we're gonna pray a little bit
[304:15] stiffensing never gonna work we're
[304:17] supposed to have a new database that
[304:19] will go show up soon
[304:22] data
[304:23] okay yeah we've never connected to that
[304:25] maybe I need to turn off on another
[304:26] server to make sure it doesn't cache the
[304:29]  stuff
[304:32] all right
[304:34] let's go for a mix of Errors deck
[304:39] bingo
[304:41] all right there we go
[304:46] models is not Define okay
[304:55] uh
[305:19] that's not too complicated
[305:27] let's do that
[305:50] oh no we need to do it here as well
[305:56] types
[306:00] I boom
[306:04] and we need Shimmer types in here
[306:08] all right let's give it another try
[306:12] no way that's
[306:16] there's no way
[306:18]  it's working
[306:22] wow so first
[306:26] oh it is I can't believe let's check the
[306:29] database of the recursor well
[306:31] hero feeds user
[306:34] Mr Markley Gmail BR password
[306:38] uh it's supposed to be hashed
[306:42] no I should have never coded it so it's
[306:43] normal it's not hash uh that seems to be
[306:46] correct
[306:47] and we have access tokens a refresh
[306:50] token and an access token okay
[306:54] okay
[306:55] very strange
[306:58] expecting a lot of Errors at first but
[307:00] uh not too bad
[307:02] yeah the refresh token that is being
[307:04] saved in the database okay
[307:07] all right we need to Hash the password
[307:09] otherwise
[307:11] something really bad is going to happen
[307:14] um how do I do it in habits Garden
[307:22] it's both the service
[307:24] log in with
[307:26] no no
[307:28] user.service
[307:35] oh yeah we need to check users don't
[307:38] have the same email as well
[307:42] we're going to attach that method to the
[307:44] user
[307:59] it's email ticket
[308:02] user user FEMA user schema
[308:07] email exclude user thesis final one
[308:11] looks like it's going to be a right
[308:15] we are going to copy that code
[308:28] you I don't know if I'm trying to make
[308:30] this uh
[308:32] I'm trying to make this a bit
[308:33] interesting for for you so I'm trying to
[308:36] talk you know what's going on in my mind
[308:37] and not really very quiet when I code
[308:40] you guys have any suggestions or any
[308:42] things you want to see here not see that
[308:45] here you let me know and the text that
[308:48] I'm using
[308:49] um it's here somewhere there
[308:51] um next yes elwin CSS and Daisy UI for
[308:55] the design uh capacity torch turn the
[308:57] app into a native app and ship it on the
[308:59] stores mongodb for the database
[309:02] and nexjs API routes for the backend
[309:11] yeah
[309:13] send a book
[309:20] um we're gonna do use nuts what are you
[309:23] doing here
[309:25] okay find it
[309:32] please email
[309:35] again
[309:40] it doesn't await
[309:44] we use it
[309:48] hey okay
[309:56] you can request that buddy
[310:00] that email
[310:05] status
[310:08] return
[310:18] let's see that works
[310:21] sign up in terms of our error
[310:25] what are you trying to tell me return
[310:31] internal server error okay so probably
[310:34] you don't like that thing
[310:41] they're trying to tell me
[310:47] oh give me a second I think someone is
[310:48] on my door I'll be back
[310:52] hello
[312:25] oh okay I know
[312:28] let's restart
[312:30] cache and we are good
[312:35] ready three two one bam
[312:39] no it's supposed to know the work you're
[312:40] not supposed to accept that thing did
[312:42] you oh no you didn't okay
[312:45] database
[312:48] users if there are two users I kill
[312:51] myself nope luckily it's not gonna
[312:53] happen
[312:54] at a request okay
[312:56] okay okay
[312:58] things hurt doing it will
[313:02] okay
[313:04] then what do we do uh
[313:10] we create a user
[313:14] but we create the user we
[313:16] create the tokens
[313:18] how do we do with the password the thing
[313:21] how do we Ash that thing
[313:34] I don't remember how do I ask the
[313:36] password
[313:38] I'm gonna create
[313:56] oh okay that's on the Shimmer all right
[314:03] and we are going to get that thing too
[314:07] okay
[314:09] this email taken
[314:12] decrypt we don't have big Library
[314:16] decrease JS and maybe we need some
[314:21] oh we might need this
[314:24] anyway
[314:43] hey Julian um
[314:46] I just remember by something like six or
[314:49] seven years ago when I started the
[314:50] journey
[314:51] and uh yeah
[314:54] I've basically been learning the wrong
[314:57] way at the beginning learning like how
[314:58] to use Frameworks
[315:00] like are unique and stuff I didn't even
[315:02] know how to do JavaScript
[315:04] then about a year and a half ago I
[315:06] started to take it seriously and I
[315:08] learned from scratch
[315:09] and uh yeah so yeah that's two years
[315:12] Cersei and seven years from the first
[315:13] line of code
[315:18] watch okay
[315:21] we have no we don't have to be creepy
[315:32] come on be kind to me
[315:34] what's your name
[315:37] be Crypt GS
[315:40] speed creep
[315:42] oh
[315:57] this is gonna work
[315:59] here's best friend match and we are
[316:01] going to do the last thing when we save
[316:04] it that's where this is the right name
[316:08] okay you're here okay that's the right
[316:10] name we hash the password we create hash
[316:16] okay
[316:18] bye bye next next and now we are going
[316:21] to delete the user and see if that works
[316:28] so I'm supposed to have this password
[316:32] into a hash mode but it seems to have it
[316:35] worked
[316:38] to listen to music hey Google
[316:40] play The Blaze
[316:45] okay the best rate is hashed
[316:47] congratulations ladies and gentlemen
[316:54] do commits but we're gonna call it a
[317:06] okay you get all those tokens that's
[317:08] nice for you congratulations
[317:11] um
[317:28] okay no so I'm able to create a user
[317:31] create a tokens for him or her to access
[317:33] the app
[317:34] I need on the back end to have some kind
[317:36] of middleware that checks whether the
[317:38] request is uh coming from a real user so
[317:41] I checked the I think the access token
[317:45] um and same again as I did I use this
[317:47] for habits Garden
[317:49] another app I built
[317:50] and I'm going to
[317:53] use the same
[317:55] um flow
[317:57] I just don't remember how I did it for
[317:59] the other app so I need to go in die a
[318:01] old code of mine
[318:07] and copy past it basically I think it's
[318:09] passport yeah I think I use best for G2
[318:22] wife I think my wife is stuck at the
[318:24] entrance the door I'll be back
[319:09] welcome back
[319:15] I think we're just gonna copy that thing
[319:34] how do I use it I think
[319:37] I think I think I think it's in the
[319:39] routes
[319:40] um middlewares maybe oh maybe oath oh
[319:43] it's a middleware
[319:48] sport she is what do they do
[320:02] let's learn about next year's middleware
[320:07] doesn't work
[320:55] okay this is what we're gonna do
[320:58] before we get the middleware
[321:13] so we have
[321:15] this thing
[322:16] and here
[322:19] say the garden service no
[322:23] Garden Route
[322:27] I think
[322:29] whatever Garden routes
[322:36] middleware
[322:41] it's called
[323:24] oh okay
[323:35] if you're tuning in right now I'm trying
[323:37] to set up the back end for
[323:40] um authentication for users
[323:43] uh I'm using a scratch uh backend I
[323:48] think uh that I so I make GWT tokens
[323:50] from scratch I don't use Firebase or
[323:53] anything
[323:54] uh and uh I don't know how to do it so I
[323:57] reuse some of my old code that is
[323:59] working that I'm trying to understand
[324:01] how it works so I can use it on my app
[324:09] thank you man thank you Julian
[324:24] oh yeah yeah there's some guys at my uni
[324:27] that were exactly like this too
[324:30] people
[324:33] yeah Google answered
[324:39] you don't need to
[324:41] right
[324:48] mistaken a sport initialize and we use
[324:51] that strategy
[324:54] that twt strategy is over there
[325:13] import
[325:57] ant
[326:14] Square so we're
[326:20] so if I'm not mistaken that is
[326:30] server that is that thing so I need to
[326:33] initialize password which I guess
[326:34] handles the code thing of
[326:38] GWT tokens
[326:40] and I'm gonna use the strategy okay so
[326:43] he tells
[326:44] a sport
[326:46] how to use it okay okay I think if okay
[326:53] that's the next choice middleware that I
[326:55] have to create
[326:57] all routes
[326:59] does it work
[327:03] greater middleware TS it's fine the same
[327:06] limit as your feet or the roots or
[327:12] in the page why not in the API
[327:22] there's any next.js expert here
[327:25] love your health why do I need to put
[327:27] the middleware
[327:29] at the same level as your pages
[327:34] it's not supposed to be um API
[327:40] or the middleware function from
[327:42] middleware ts5
[329:33] maybe we'll ask Google then password is
[329:36] next yes
[329:44] I'll save me
[330:46] Xavier
[331:00] okay
[331:03] okay
[331:05] and
[331:07] that's okay
[331:10] okay okay
[331:18] thank you man
[331:20] I appreciate it
[331:22] for some reason I thought it would be it
[331:24] would fit into the API folder
[331:27] I thought it was all basically all the
[331:29] back-end stuff handled by Nexus would be
[331:31] and around here
[331:33] but uh
[331:35] I get to Point here and I will just put
[331:36] it as you said somewhere in the roots
[331:38] folder thanks man
[331:57] so let's give it a try
[332:00] middleware.gs
[332:03] The Roots
[332:05] and the code is
[332:14] um
[332:27] something
[332:36] instead of the protected roots and uh
[332:42] out
[332:44] we're gonna set uh
[332:50] app now
[332:53] wait
[332:55] no actually I'm making a mistake right
[332:57] here
[332:59] is it no
[333:06] oh
[333:09] okay okay confused
[333:15] okay I'm gonna try
[333:17] to sign up and see start with
[333:22] search with
[333:34] just check this
[333:38] hello
[333:46] see what's going on
[333:49] show me
[334:01] okay
[334:05] before I search
[335:53] okay so coming so
[335:55] on my front end I will
[335:58] um do things like actions like signing
[336:00] up tracking habits and things
[336:03] and I will also access the dashboard
[336:05] that is meant to be private for the user
[336:09] so I need to use the G like a GWT oath
[336:14] token strategy so it means like every
[336:16] time I get a request on my API or some
[336:20] pages that are predicted like the user
[336:21] dashboard I need to decode the oauth
[336:24] tokens that the user is sending
[336:26] and reply with the right
[336:29] data so let's say you're trying to track
[336:31] your habits I want to make sure you are
[336:33] the users you claim to be with that oath
[336:35] token and so I was hoping somehow the
[336:37] Middle where we get me there
[336:40] um
[336:41] I think I'm confused between two things
[336:43] which will first the middle I think
[336:45] their API routes and there is also just
[336:47] routes in general for next I think if
[336:50] I'm not mistaken the Middle where we'll
[336:52] run every time I change pages so it's
[336:54] going to run here
[336:56] yep okay
[336:58] okay I'm I don't know if that makes any
[337:00] sense
[337:12] and um and so what I'm trying to do is
[337:14] I'm trying to bring that piece of code
[337:16] that I used to have on my other app that
[337:18] works with uh it's basically using the
[337:20] Json web token stuff
[337:22] I need to set up something where every
[337:25] time
[337:26] um a request comes in
[337:28] I check that the payload is right
[337:30] so I decode from I extract the the alt
[337:34] token the the header and I decode it and
[337:37] I find the user
[337:39] based on the payload of the token
[337:42] and then if there's a user so that user
[337:45] is actually the person he came so she
[337:46] seems to be then I I move on and if he's
[337:48] not then I just you know return an error
[337:51] or something
[337:52] and in my older app I was doing this
[337:55] thing so on the main app I use
[337:58] everywhere I set up the passport
[338:00] initialize it with the strategy the the
[338:02] one I just showed you
[338:04] this one
[338:08] and then when a request comes in on
[338:10] every routes I have a middleware called
[338:13] uh oh
[338:15] so different API routes I will call this
[338:19] middleware that would basically check
[338:22] that the user has access using this Json
[338:26] the the GWT strategy was set up before
[338:30] in the middleware
[338:34] that makes any sense
[338:59] I'm going to set up a little stuff
[339:02] is clear
[339:03] um
[339:08] I'm gonna have routes like slash app
[339:10] that are private
[339:12] so I need
[339:14] to send
[339:16] prompt needs to send both token
[339:21] in the back
[339:23] needs to check
[339:27] the token and returns
[339:29] age accordingly
[339:32] accordingly
[339:35] and also at the same time I'm going to
[339:37] have slash API slash
[339:40] blah blah blah
[339:42] that are all private
[339:45] um
[339:46] and that's same from needs to send us to
[339:49] again and back needs to check and return
[339:52] the data accordingly
[339:54] so route
[339:57] API
[339:59] I have those two things
[340:08] if this doesn't make any sense you know
[340:18] and I mean so it's using Json web token
[340:21] strategies
[340:23] okay okay
[340:27] I think someone
[340:29] a busy day I think someone is ringing at
[340:31] my door I'll be back in a minute
[346:07] welcome back
[346:11] to Define which investment lawyers will
[346:12] run on your API okay
[346:20] now you compare it into it
[346:27] oh wow man you're so kind of
[346:29] see it do I pronounce your name right
[347:17] see it okay okay
[347:22] then we are building drop your Twitter
[347:24] man after I need to I want to on the
[347:26] landing page I'll put the name of
[347:28] everyone who's been on that app whether
[347:30] it's just an ID or helping with a code
[347:31] or something
[347:33] and it's it's a it's a crowdsource app
[347:39] API path
[347:40] okay you can do something like that
[347:47] or maybe I'll call it app
[348:18] using
[348:20] [Music]
[348:20] um
[348:28] nice
[348:39] get aware
[348:43] that's foreign
[349:14] maybe I don't have it
[349:23] okay all right I'm gonna show you the I
[349:25] mean actually for now there's no error
[349:26] everything is working well I haven't
[349:28] done anything I mean all I've done is
[349:31] this I'm trying to write in the
[349:32] middleware initialize the passport
[349:33] strategy and making sure that works
[349:36] uh so there's no actually real errors
[349:38] let's just uh I don't know if that's the
[349:40] way I should be doing it
[349:42] I'll give it a try
[349:53] or GWT
[349:59] I need your Facebook
[350:20] okay yep that was this one
[350:25] the import passport here we initialize
[350:27] it
[350:28] with no parameters that's how we do it
[350:31] here
[350:40] or maybe we can just try this
[350:42] see how that works
[350:45] I refresh
[350:47] looks like uh I'm not calling any of
[350:50] those
[350:53] um
[350:54] they will just add a sign of brow just
[350:56] for testing
[350:58] it is actually being cold
[351:05] it's imperative
[351:09] what is this Source doesn't start with
[351:11] this no
[351:12] yep sorry
[351:17] oh I will stop next to your server if
[351:20] the middleware has an issue it is
[351:22] interesting
[351:27] yeah of course if I'm not using my
[351:29] strategy
[351:32] um Imports
[351:37] where did I pick it up here GWT
[351:43] I'm thinking that's best for it
[351:46] okay
[351:47] so that's the passport stuff important
[351:53] strategy
[351:54] [Music]
[351:57] um
[352:01] uh Eve
[352:05] all right let's see
[352:07] refresh
[352:08] nope
[352:11]  runtime does not support node.js
[352:14] util module ah okay
[352:18] that's for the YouTube module
[352:21] see if we can get this a bit bigger
[352:25] The Edge runtime does not support
[352:27] node.js util modules
[352:42] am I using this somewhere
[352:50] maybe it
[352:53] messaging Synergy is module in Edge
[352:56] runtime
[352:58] maybe I need to transpile the call
[353:10] yes
[353:12] where are you Mr
[353:13] you're not there
[353:19] what are you good
[353:26] this is no more next year is comfy in my
[353:30] what is going on
[353:32] where are you next years
[353:34] what have I done did I remove it
[353:39] I'd be scared oh I am in the wrong app
[353:44] this is the previous one okay
[354:04] um
[354:07] transpile packages
[354:10] are we gonna try some magic tricks
[354:14] transplant packages we're gonna
[354:16] transpile uh sport
[354:18] and passport G
[354:25] we're gonna say inshallah
[354:30] start again
[354:35] another bit of
[354:36] course it doesn't work
[354:39] okay why don't you like it the edge
[354:41] runtime doesn't support node.js util
[354:43] module
[354:46] and this is called
[354:48] personal trilogy
[354:50] middleware passport is ready so you
[354:54] don't like
[354:58] something in there
[355:09] Yes dear friend Google yeah just I just
[355:12] said Angela
[355:14] uh
[355:18] sometimes uh that makes my code running
[355:19] so I I give it a try
[355:26] hey sirens
[355:37] known Edge version what is that what is
[355:40] known Edge
[355:44] all right please
[355:55] and not use
[356:01] options Financial
[356:05] on other files
[356:19] you see in the middleware
[356:22] yeah
[356:31] the cookies in a server and decade
[356:36] yeah that could work too
[356:39] and now I'm still stuck with the
[356:40] decoding so
[356:42] in the Middle where I initialize my
[356:44] passport strategy
[356:46] but I have an error so maybe I try to
[356:49] remove this one see making sure that's
[356:50] the second one
[356:53] okay the a doesn't like
[357:01] all right he doesn't even wait he
[357:04] doesn't even let me do anything here
[357:08] what is happening
[357:11] uh okay okay I cannot even import
[357:13] because in the middleware itself doesn't
[357:15] even work with passport for now
[357:21] and I think this yeah okay that
[357:25] GWT strategy so that thing here
[357:29] that file
[357:32] um somehow it's
[357:34] thing this is this one
[357:36] it's somehow up the middleware
[357:52] yeah it is
[357:57] yeah the edge runtime does not support
[358:00] node.js util module
[358:04] so as for GS here this thing is using an
[358:08] ogs utl module
[358:12] that I need to get rid of
[358:26] yeah you can yeah they don't allow links
[358:28] for some reason uh maybe you can send it
[358:30] to me on Twitter if there's a way
[358:34] you might end up in my spam but uh
[358:41] maybe even look for your profile Maybe
[358:50] I don't know that's you know 2010
[358:52] probably not
[358:54] maybe if you let me know your Twitter or
[358:56] if you DM me
[358:58] maybe that could work you don't end up
[359:00] in the spam folder
[359:03] okay
[359:07] where are you calling from man where are
[359:09] you going where where are you actually
[359:10] based oh yeah
[359:12] but I think I've seen your picture
[359:18] senior picture where why is that
[359:21] no not Philippines maybe Philippines
[359:26] Vietnam no
[359:33] India oh Phuket okay okay
[359:37] I don't oh okay I see oh yeah that's
[359:40] nice place
[359:42] yo
[359:49] what is going on here
[359:52] there's nothing board position
[360:00] why are you nuts
[360:11] desire incision
[360:56] I've been awareness with their parents
[361:08] what was that release
[361:29] oh okay okay
[361:39] I think yeah let's go I'm pretty sure we
[361:42] can actually do that with the middleware
[361:45] um but I need to be able to initialize
[361:46] my passport strategies
[361:49] so I don't have to change all my
[361:50] back-end stuff I can use the tokens I'm
[361:53] using a token model
[361:55] is that thing here I have a token that
[361:58] is saved in the database that stores the
[362:00] user uh the token itself and verifies
[362:03] that every time the user emits a
[362:04] requests middleware can process it
[362:07] and make sure that's the actually the
[362:09] user but
[362:12] um
[362:13] Nexus telling me that the edge runtime
[362:16] does not support node.js util modules
[362:19] so it means
[362:21] that
[362:23] thing here so this thing here
[362:27] which I think this thing here
[362:30] is using a util module and I cannot use
[362:33] it
[362:35] I need to find a way to solve that
[362:46] what the guy said I said he's tough
[362:50] somewhere and it worked
[362:52] [Music]
[362:53] um
[362:54] sorts middleware
[362:57] I think oh station
[363:09] position index middleware pages
[364:36] the developers kind of
[364:44] explain me what is next runtime
[364:50] where an edge
[364:59] okay super nice but what is it
[365:22] bro you're good I like you but I don't
[365:25] think we're gonna use the edge run time
[365:50] server run
[365:52] learning something today
[365:54] I can't run into parts of your
[365:55] application
[366:13] oh okay
[366:39] here's the phone
[366:45] for middleware run using the default
[366:47] instead of the edge runtime
[367:16] oh that's ugly
[367:30] uh maybe not
[368:31] and give it a try
[368:47] these work
[368:54] all right you're not gonna let me do
[368:56] that
[369:52] change the middleware
[369:55] pages
[369:57] would be fun
[370:00] no way there's no way that works
[370:06] no not possible
[370:09] a little weird
[370:12] oh
[370:16] you're not even being used okay
[370:19] August you consider it's a page though
[370:22] but awareness
[370:33] is your pages in The Roots
[370:37] oh no okay
[371:24] foreign
[372:39] okay you're nice
[372:56] I know
[373:00] he's here okay
[373:31] are you using here
[373:45] hey Google
[373:46] what's up
[375:51] okay that's interesting
[375:53] I have to redo it from scratch
[375:56] is this good workout
[380:02] wait oh okay
[380:12] I think I also found a repo
[380:16] this thing here waste passport
[380:19] looks like they got something that seems
[380:21] to be working well
[380:22] should be a way to do it
[380:30] like Twitter what's gonna
[381:16] [Music]
[381:27] oh I think we get this
[381:29] no
[381:33] same one
[382:09] oh cool
[382:14] oh
[382:27] you certainly sure if I use the present
[382:29] him okay
[382:31] I think it's a bit similar to what I
[382:34] have but it's using passport local
[382:42] s
[382:44] uh what do we have here
[384:42] I need uh I don't know if that would
[384:44] work because I need I actually need to
[384:46] identify users with their oauth token
[384:49] I'm gonna create an access token
[384:52] that it will get
[384:54] and that's how I'm gonna identify them
[384:57] uh because I want to implement some like
[385:00] social sign ups like Google for instance
[385:03] so most users won't have a password
[385:06] and I'm not sure password local would
[385:08] actually work
[385:14] would be so simple why you don't accept
[385:16] this
[386:56] foreign
[391:04] oh
[392:44] it came to me
[392:59] wait where the hours are we in the
[393:02] Stream six or seven hours
[395:40] yes
[395:42] and this
[396:00] and do something like this
[396:03] telling me this this is going to work no
[396:08] start okay
[396:59] maybe okay
[397:02] of course that wouldn't work
[397:24] okay
[398:20] okay so I guess we have to restart
[398:21] everything from
[398:23] a teammate
[398:26] hey hey back love uh it's uh so we got
[398:31] the ID we're going to build a workout
[398:33] app where you grow an avatar as you go
[398:36] through your goals and you can see other
[398:37] people's avatars
[398:39] we bought the domain name and uh it's
[398:42] called the hero feed app
[398:45] um and I'm just setting up the coding
[398:47] environments and I have a basic sign of
[398:49] flow and I'm struggling with the
[398:52] authentication flow
[398:54] um so the app will be mobile
[398:57] I'm going to use capacitor to make sure
[399:01] that you know we have it's super easy to
[399:03] get the mobile app so I need to have
[399:05] some kind of um
[399:07] web like uh
[399:09] cookies or or their token Authentication
[399:13] and I'm kind of struggling with what
[399:15] technology should I be using for that
[399:17] that's pretty much where I am
[399:46] hey
[399:51] you're you're about to hear a french guy
[399:54] complaining because uh I thought he
[399:56] would be easy to get those uh things
[399:58] running but I'm running with a into a
[400:01] bug
[400:01] I mean it's not a bug but it's just it's
[400:03] not a feature that supported in xjs so I
[400:05] might have to redo the entire uh flow
[400:09] uh Adam so yeah I'm looking for how to
[400:12] do it
[400:14] um so basically
[400:16] I need to generate some kind of token
[400:18] for the user on the back end and send it
[400:20] back as a cookie or something
[400:24] um
[400:24] I want to be able to use social uh
[400:28] plugins like Google or Twitter later
[400:31] so uh
[400:34] I need a some kind of solution that it
[400:36] allows me to do that inside of capacitor
[400:40] and that's just struggle right now
[401:09] yeah go ahead go ahead always happy to
[401:11] see some
[401:13] Energies I think I've heard of them yeah
[401:15] it's pretty cool
[401:18] first
[401:41] I'm going to explore it
[401:43] um
[401:45] I'm afraid that's the same thing as next
[401:47] next oath
[401:49] which
[401:51] so to build the mobile app
[401:54] uh with
[401:57] and to be able to set cookies
[402:00] in the brother so users is always
[402:02] authenticated
[402:05] I need to do it manually and I'm afraid
[402:07] super token will do the same at next
[402:09] oath
[402:10] and so when when it's going to the user
[402:13] is going to try to sign up and login is
[402:14] going to put the cookies into the web
[402:16] View and then when the webview will be
[402:18] closed after the login then the cookies
[402:20] will be lost
[402:22] um
[402:23] it's what a kind of super cool
[402:26] and I want to play hours with it
[402:33] we're gonna see what next say about the
[402:35] documentation and and keep in mind for
[402:37] later
[403:13] yeah yeah exactly
[403:16] yeah it can be local storage that's
[403:17] that's also fine
[403:44] oh there we go super tokens are here
[403:51] foreign
[404:57] yeah and so and for that thing I wanted
[404:59] to use passport
[405:01] uh but it doesn't work because it says
[405:05] um I'm using the GWT strategy
[405:10] from passport this thing plus
[405:11] projectability and this is something
[405:13] that needs to run on a node.js runtime
[405:16] and um the middleware or
[405:19] Nexus is running on something that is
[405:22] not a node.js runtime
[405:24] so it doesn't have access to some
[405:26] functions and what happens is I get
[405:28] errors like uh
[405:32] if I get errors like this
[405:35] that he needs to use the node.js util
[405:37] module
[405:38] which is needed for passport GWT
[405:42] that don't have it on the next CS
[405:45] middleware runtime which means I cannot
[405:47] use the current code I have
[405:49] so I have basically to rethink about it
[405:53] from scratch and uh I'm exploring this
[405:56] little thing here
[405:57] see how that goes
[406:08] that's perfect
[406:18] oops
[406:21] but it how bad is it when okay I'm going
[406:24] to talk some stuff see how bad is my
[406:26] audio
[406:29] hey
[406:35] supposed to be
[406:37] supposed to be a good mic normally
[406:39] maybe that's my Wi-Fi
[406:56] okay
[406:58] he was quick okay
[407:01] all right we're back
[407:07] so you have the middleware
[407:11] you have
[407:12] sessions what are sessions
[407:16] okay
[408:19] Frank I don't really know
[408:22] uh
[408:24] I think it's
[408:31] I don't know man uh I think it's it's
[408:34] the it makes the link from between
[408:37] the token the user
[408:42] what I'm saying uh
[408:45] and I think it's it's the library that
[408:47] is handling all the logic for Json web
[408:51] tokens
[408:56] same in here
[408:57] has the same product I mean here is like
[408:59] it's gonna ask me to find users
[409:10] I from the token I just need to know who
[409:12] the years the user is so basically it's
[409:14] user ID that will be stored in the
[409:16] database
[409:30] yeah I think I shouldn't be using that
[409:32] thing maybe just that sounds like people
[409:35] are running with this
[409:38] um
[409:55] okay
[409:57] subjectly
[410:40] ah you're an Angelman
[412:30] hey
[412:32] yo and
[412:34] struggling with the authentication flow
[412:45] that would work
[412:55] okay here's your issue
[412:58] try to put it down
[413:10] so I'm they're going to be a capacitor
[413:13] app
[413:19] which is a native mobile application
[413:22] and that app
[413:25] needs
[413:27] to make calls to
[413:29] um
[413:36] okay so the app will need two things
[413:39] it'll need to call like uh private
[413:41] routes
[413:43] like slash app or slash dashboard which
[413:48] is private
[413:49] and the front end just need to say to
[413:52] the back end like hey this is me uh this
[413:54] is user ABC and I need my data
[413:58] there are also apis
[414:01] um API routes that I need as a user I
[414:03] need to track my data so for instance I
[414:05] completed my running habit
[414:08] I need to post something on slash API
[414:10] slash ebit ID slash track or something
[414:15] um
[414:22] and so it's using next.js
[414:25] um so there are text like next oath that
[414:27] is working really well for that that I
[414:30] could use to handle the authentication
[414:31] flow for me
[414:33] but the thing is
[414:34] um I want to make a mobile app because I
[414:36] think it's very important for that thing
[414:38] and I'm going to be using capacitor and
[414:45] when I'm gonna have social logins on the
[414:48] web there won't be any problem but on
[414:50] the mobile app if I log in
[414:54] with Twitter on the capacitor app so I'm
[414:57] gonna be on my simulator
[415:00] or whatever I'm going to be on my iPhone
[415:03] [Music]
[415:06] this is the app and I'm gonna log in
[415:08] with Twitter
[415:09] he's gonna open a web view in the app
[415:13] and then I'm going to be logged in but
[415:16] inside of that webview but as soon as
[415:18] I'm logged in it's going to close the
[415:20] webview and come back to the app
[415:23] and that's where the program comes in
[415:24] because the app will never actually get
[415:27] the authentication token needed to
[415:30] interact with the backend
[415:32] and so
[415:35] things like next oath
[415:39] with social logins
[415:42] won't allow me
[415:45] or both token on the front end
[416:00] and so I've seen a guy doing a
[416:01] workaround a workaround for this
[416:04] but it's it's a bit sketchy it's like
[416:06] you have to put on listeners to the
[416:09] webview that's next oath will open for
[416:11] the social login
[416:12] uh I feel like it's a bit hacky and it's
[416:15] just something that's going to break
[416:16] into a month and uh
[416:19] I'm wondering if there's not just an
[416:21] easier solution
[416:37] Nate actually
[417:31] so
[417:35] actually need to put
[417:41] oh so
[417:44] is it what you're saying so
[417:48] after you log in with Twitter it sends a
[417:50] request to the back end
[417:52] and that's going to send back the token
[417:54] to the front end to the app
[418:03] yep isn't the right about storing the
[418:05] joke
[418:12] yep
[418:46] okay
[418:51] you know I mean you probably know way
[418:52] better than me Emma pretty beginner
[418:55] especially for those authentication
[418:56] things
[419:04] I mean we could give it a try we can try
[419:06] next oath and set it up and see what how
[419:08] that works
[419:28] it works actually that would be the best
[419:30] thing this is the really the simplest
[419:32] thing
[419:37] APA around
[419:51] um
[419:53] no what's the name of it
[419:58] page API both okay
[420:05] and we're gonna add this thing
[420:19] no worries man we're gonna give it a try
[420:20] we're gonna see what's going on with
[420:21] this and we're gonna assess
[420:24] uh go back all request to apis I need
[420:27] call back it will be undone okay
[420:30] I figure the shirts session States
[420:34] oh yeah we need a session provider
[420:37] and weaker
[420:47] um
[420:59] what is your what is your what do you do
[421:10] hey
[421:23] okay
[421:31] that's a good question
[421:36] remove that thing
[421:40] so we are on the sign up
[421:46] page
[421:49] um
[422:00] who is
[422:17] where are we
[422:18] working
[422:34] a decision coming from
[422:37] okay
[422:42] open it
[422:48] is it session in pictures okay
[423:04] it's something okay so it's ugly
[423:08] okay there's no bug at least
[423:12] red hot buildings
[423:15] oh okay
[423:19] oh okay yeah well yeah you would love it
[423:22] it's actually uh I feel like an
[423:23] extension of react
[423:25] I'm sorry really
[423:27] um
[423:27] this loaded all the HTML is ready so
[423:30] it's super fast for users and it has a
[423:32] cool apis as well
[423:34] not really not really really complicated
[423:39] nice man
[423:51] all right so
[423:53] um how does it work
[423:55] setup
[424:03] service section
[424:37] name
[424:43] so if we try something like this
[424:55] [Music]
[425:26] we are and route
[425:30] oh
[425:39] follicles API
[425:54] right
[425:56] I'll be back in a minute
[425:58] bathroom break
[429:01] um
[429:30] hello
[429:35] okay I'll be back
[430:08] um
[430:19] all right I'll be back in a minute so I
[430:20] just need to pull the tokens from
[430:22] Twitter
[430:26] this old token to allow login with
[430:28] Twitter I'll be back in a minute
[432:18] all right welcome back sorry
[432:20] um I was basically taking
[432:22] the Twitter all stockings uh Twitter API
[432:26] key sorry for the next OS stuff
[432:29] so we're back
[432:32] both
[432:33] providers
[432:46] gonna get
[432:49] Fighters tweeter
[432:51] skip Twitter
[432:55] provider
[432:59] and we are going to use that
[433:02] good
[433:03] all the thing
[433:09] so we have that we don't need now
[433:13] and we are going to import Twitter
[433:24] Legacy oh cool
[433:27] anyway we can use
[433:32] we'll see
[433:39] so when I sign up
[433:49] with a different accounts doesn't work
[433:51] on my other app
[434:05] maybe didn't do something right
[434:36] I think I got the wrong
[434:42] come on
[434:45] oh maybe it doesn't load
[434:48] but it's gonna
[434:52] authentic EQ everybody I know that
[435:00] sign
[435:05] we
[435:07] do this
[437:33] is vulnerable
[437:40] yep
[437:59] oh maybe that's the problem
[438:05] yep sounds like it was the issue huh
[438:10] version 2.0
[438:16] again
[438:21] right
[438:23] up I'll basically
[438:29] hey bro plug me in
[438:33] okay that is working well
[438:39] so now we have the user
[438:51] boy are you
[439:00] all right so the my big struggle with
[439:04] this which is working well
[439:06] I wish we could go in that way because
[439:08] then it would be on the app greatly but
[439:12] it is not going to work
[439:15] um
[439:27] it's going to happen so npn run mobile
[439:31] we're gonna Build It Up
[439:33] and we're gonna ship it on the simulator
[439:35] and see what's going on
[439:40] oh maybe we need something like uh maybe
[439:43] we can create bursts
[439:47] uh
[439:55] I'm gonna call it app from the GS
[439:59] and we are going back if this user is
[440:02] signed up
[440:07] actually
[440:10] it's even protected routes
[440:13] so
[440:32] something like this
[440:37] um
[440:57] out sign in
[441:06] so if I go to app do I get and it is
[441:11] like I'm pretty well logged in
[441:15] um
[441:19] okay
[441:21] if I delete my cookies
[441:25] and reload I'm not signed in
[441:30] what we can do is we can do if
[441:34] session
[441:42] powder
[441:45] powder
[441:49] next juice where are you so use router
[442:09] router touch
[442:48] oh you might not be ready okay
[443:40] these are a function use effect of a
[443:43] right
[444:19] forget about this for now up
[444:30] okay
[444:31] and on the index we are put a link for
[444:35] up

[451:38] okay okay
[451:41] yeah of course
[451:58] position
[452:29] oh okay
[453:18] foreign
[454:01] react right
[454:15] oh okay you give it components
[454:22] he's at the script or something I've no
[454:25] I've never seen this before what am I
[454:27] doing
[454:29] great context
[454:30] Maybe
[454:33] a thing
[454:40] about usage
[455:21] okay
[455:25] foreign
[455:51] that's Chinese for me
[455:58] is there is any type script uh knowledge
[456:02] person here I I don't use typescript at
[456:05] all and I'm wondering how can I
[456:06] translate this into just JavaScript
[456:10] I think it's using stay that's for sure
[456:15] if
[456:22] it's either one or the other
[457:28] I'm um I'm just trying to it's I copy
[457:32] past this code from the documentation
[457:34] I'm just trying to change a few things
[457:36] like I had this thing that I need to
[457:38] transform from typescript to JavaScript
[457:40] and also this sorry this
[457:43] thing here
[457:44] both of those lines
[457:46] just have no idea how to make them just
[457:49] JavaScript
[457:51] stuff
[457:52] they don't know what this session is
[458:09] an object or something
[458:16] maybe something like this
[458:29] what they're trying to do
[458:30] type another type initial value
[458:35] oh okay okay
[458:38] oh so that
[458:41] okay
[458:43] well basically this
[458:46] is like
[458:48] another time
[459:01] right there yeah I agree uh maybe I can
[459:04] show you the code that they gave in the
[459:07] recommendation
[459:09] oh I think the guy using it
[459:11] here yeah that's one of the git code the
[459:14] GitHub code so I think create context
[459:16] you just create the context was no
[459:18] nothing
[459:21] and they use state
[459:24] oh I think my oh maybe my vs code
[459:28] it up that's probably what happened
[459:30] oh yeah because now it makes sense
[459:32] because now it looks like your code okay
[459:34] so you state equal no
[459:43] I don't know what happened with my vs
[459:45] code I think it's uh I didn't like the
[459:47] typescript any added parenthesis
[459:49] everywhere
[459:50] very context and we are going to just
[459:53] set no
[459:57] we don't need this anymore we don't need
[459:59] that anymore
[460:01] it looks like we have the use session
[460:04] router Router
[460:06] right here
[460:09] how did you do that bro
[460:13] record
[460:16] wait
[460:43] what is that what is the Callback thing
[460:53] remember we get a TV sample bingo
[461:11] oh no
[461:16] that looks ugly as a hell
[462:12] meter provider what are you doing
[462:21] I'm gonna decode that thing
[462:23] um what are you saying looking with
[462:25] GitHub
[464:11] in a laptop
[464:13] um
[464:14] same it's a MacBook Pro the latest one
[464:18] no external monitor
[464:23] this is
[464:28] okay
[464:33] that's exactly I'm removing all the time
[464:36] from time scripture
[464:38] I'm somehow learning a little bit of
[464:39] typescript at the same time
[464:42] in a browser
[464:44] okay so I guess I need to eat this
[465:01]  Mike is cutting in and outs uh
[465:05] let me try maybe I I messed up the
[465:08] filters
[465:12] oh noise suppression
[465:15] how is gate
[465:18] uh
[465:23] an Eid
[465:29] I don't know
[465:56] yeah I know some at some point I'll have
[465:58] to do it
[466:51] missings enemies no no other chance I'm
[466:57] just gonna remove you
[466:59] up
[467:03] okay with GitHub
[467:17] include
[467:35] we have
[467:39] um I want to use Twitter for now
[467:46] picture
[467:52] session
[468:20] [Music]
[468:22] utils we have
[468:26] a helper we have a station
[468:31] we have the app
[468:45] and next oath
[468:54] and we want to test it
[471:25] in here
[471:26] uh
[473:12] I'm going to turn off the stream for a
[473:14] second
[473:16] I need to reveal some config
[474:39] welcome back
[474:44] birthday
[474:47] nicely back
[474:49] alive if you're
[474:55] are you hiding behind the shoulders
[475:04] you understand something because I don't
[475:06] really understand what I'm doing so if
[475:08] you understand the comments
[475:37] the project is driving me crazy
[475:40] I haven't done anything really seriously
[475:43] yeah
[475:45] I mean
[475:46] I thought it would do a lot but I'm
[475:48] struggling with something that I'm I
[475:49] haven't done before
[475:51] you know it's not going anywhere it's uh
[475:54] I guess
[475:55] I don't even have a site like a way for
[475:57] people to log in in here
[476:04] I don't know how I don't even know what
[476:05] I'm supposed to be doing in
[476:08] I have a feeling I'm gonna spend like
[476:09] three days on something like this
[476:14] the men
[476:28] when I will keep up which I think is
[476:31] gonna be
[476:32] gonna be soon
[476:53] oh okay okay I got it that is why
[476:56] API okay
[476:59] that's it was nuts
[477:08] yep
[477:18] wondering whether
[477:19] say something
[477:24] if we speak
[477:27] I set up a filter normally so
[477:31] just if we speak very slowly like I just
[477:33] did
[477:34] normally it gets the sound
[477:36] so you can be Incognito in
[478:13] yeah that's German I think you're I I
[478:16] try to
[478:17] because next oh and other stuff like
[478:19] this will make you make it so easy for
[478:21] you to implement social logins and I was
[478:24] like ah it's gonna be so nice I can log
[478:25] in with Twitter and get them and
[478:27] everything but
[478:29] but somehow I think it's also an
[478:31] interesting project because
[478:33] for later having
[478:36] um some kind of boilerplate where I can
[478:38] set up really quickly a an app that have
[478:41] login with socials and emails and things
[478:44] can actually also be interesting
[478:47] I'm just wondering if I have currently
[478:49] have the
[478:50] skills to make it and if that can be
[478:53] interesting for you guys because if I'm
[478:54] streaming me Googling on stack of a flow
[478:57] train to fix something I don't know if
[478:58] that's how interesting is that
[479:03] an AP
[479:05] um what's the size of my monitor I don't
[479:06] really use a monitor I'm just using the
[479:08] MacBook Pro no no monitors with it
[479:11] uh I'm it's just look it's uh that's my
[479:14] setup a mic
[479:16] and the computer that's it that's the
[479:19] MacBook Pro
[479:20] uh 2023 the one that was released this
[479:23] month or this year
[479:28] yeah thanks man
[479:29] good to hear
[479:32] I just wish you know I can provide some
[479:34] kind of value for you guys and show the
[479:37] whole process but no I feel like I'm
[479:38] just stuck with that
[479:40] same thing
[479:42] see if that works
[479:51] what what I need to do
[479:58] come on acers
[480:15] yeah I was you know I moved I used to
[480:17] have the MacBook Pro 2018 or something
[480:20] the one that was really thin
[480:23] and and it was like terrible as soon as
[480:25] I would do something else than just uh
[480:28] as soon as I would do something it would
[480:30] get hot and and slow and this one is
[480:32] really obesity
[480:43] okay good point good points
[480:48] nice
[480:55] oh
[480:59] doesn't look good at all
[481:32] your function
[481:50] Security in production what are you
[481:51] talking about
[481:56] no secret
[482:09] oh okay

[499:15] I'm gonna make this commit
[499:18] um
[499:30] all right so let's see what we have
[499:48] hey thank you so much Orbitz I think my
[499:50] best advice would be to do exactly this
[499:53] and try to create a little app short
[499:56] project a week maximum to build a
[499:58] feature for a friend for you
[500:00] and make it live
[500:06] okay so
[500:08] um
[500:09] we get the login thing so I need to
[500:12] install Rosie
[500:21] we'll need a middleware we will need
[500:24] that's the login what is it Anyway
[500:30] well it's pretty cool wow
[500:33] a massive one
[500:43] this is absolutely big monster package
[500:48] okay so what do we do here you have a
[500:50] login
[500:52] um then we get
[500:58] you have cookie
[501:29] that's my location yes
[501:34] okay this is full login okay
[501:50] the middleware uh okay user looking okay
[501:55] verify oath
[501:57] P dot oath
[502:15] right I I need a quick break I need to
[502:18] get some water I'll be back in a minute
[505:18] right welcome back
[505:22] secret to building
[505:24] apps
[505:28] peanut butter and milk
[508:47] hey this Tech uh next year's Tailwind
[508:50] Daisy UI
[508:52] and for the back-end mongodb for the
[508:54] database if I get something running in
[508:56] the next GS API feature for the routes
[509:00] AP arrows
[509:18] foreign
[510:17] do that
[510:19] um maybe there's a way to pin messages
[510:26] I'll have to investigate but maybe I
[510:28] could
[510:30] I could write something somewhere here
[510:36] that's smart
[510:41] and then I had the client
[510:44] and use a cookie
[510:51] okay we'll go
[510:53] well I'm gonna give it a try then film
[511:03] I'm gonna get these in the middleware
[511:51] renovation and greeting with Mother's
[511:53] degree living in general staff for over
[511:55] a year not sure which is rituals
[511:58] um
[512:00] history my character history I mean it's
[512:02] uh you can call my Twitter you would see
[512:04] what I've been doing uh mostly
[512:09] entrepreneur stuff
[512:13] like in here I finish school somewhere
[512:16] around that time
[512:18] and then I went to Korea and I tried to
[512:20] create a startup with something very
[512:21] complicated to raise money with a friend
[512:23] and we hired people it was uh not
[512:25] working really well at the end
[512:28] um then I said it and I wanted to
[512:30] just be like a solopreneur uh no
[512:32] employee no we see nothing to build a
[512:35] project and I started to make a little
[512:37] bit of money
[512:39] um it took a little while uh it was
[512:41] great I made like I think I grew started
[512:43] up to 6K mrr or something
[512:46] um that was a big big Journey for me big
[512:49] day
[512:51] um and then I try to build another
[512:53] startup that never worked
[512:56] um then 2020 my first started that I
[512:59] created that made money went to zero
[513:01] because of kovid and then I went to a
[513:03] set of mine where I was not really happy
[513:05] uh in 2021 and it was 2021 I started to
[513:08] Indie hack and that's pretty much where
[513:10] the journey really started for me
[513:13] and and then from now on I try to keep
[513:15] building stuff
[513:21] yeah that's more information
[513:25] I think probably people are coming from
[513:27] Twitter so maybe I can yeah I can do
[513:28] something on Twitter
[513:32] and um and for the text
[513:36] what stack are you using for habit
[513:38] trigger
[513:39] um the stack is
[513:43]  I lost the page no it's here
[513:46] there you go that's the stick
[513:54] in animations
[513:56] um I I don't really have animations
[514:01] I use the basic alien CSS animation that
[514:04] comes within so like weiho anime um
[514:08] being in things
[514:09] otherwise I'll just use Daisy UI for the
[514:12] components
[514:13] it looks cool I feel
[514:19] so going back
[514:22] be aware
[514:23] um okay
[514:35] apparent this is here
[514:39] is that URL
[514:42] I'm missing something
[514:48] let's remove it
[515:00] this is it
[515:03] no it's not a defined
[515:06] not only already
[515:15] verified token
[515:23] in it return outside of it
[515:27] outside of a function
[515:30] oh
[515:37] all right I think on the first one
[515:42] um
[515:47] see what we get with this
[515:54] step
[515:58] foreign
[516:43] new error
[516:48] yep
[516:57] so verify oh
[517:01] give me a token verified
[517:05] case that thing
[517:16] by chance
[517:18] um see do you think that
[517:20] token encoder is probably coming from
[517:23] Jose
[517:25] and just actually Google it
[517:31] I think it's coming from
[517:45] I return
[518:07] a little something
[518:12] foreign
[518:50] [Music]
[519:10] this is not supposed to be here
[519:14] to be in the API route
[519:29] what do we do here we do
[519:44] mail and password
[519:57] it's okay
[520:05] next encoder
[520:15] and code
[520:23] editor
[520:25] as usual
[520:29] nope still something
[520:46] maybe here
[520:48] set header
[520:57] oh
[520:59] there it is
[521:03] [Music]
[521:10] and then
[521:14] header press that set
[521:18] status
[521:32] and we're gonna do return do stops all
[521:36] right let's see that code is working
[521:39] we get something today
[521:46] we're back fixing code here
[522:15] oh maybe text encoder is actually
[522:18] these things
[522:19] never seen that thing
[522:22] oh
[522:25] oh let's take a server code Point okay
[522:28] that's probably why
[522:33] are you taking Twitter okay
[522:39] and also in oh
[522:42] do we have one yeah
[522:46] let's try it again
[522:52] are you set it up
[523:01] Secret
[523:09] okay
[523:21] hey so I'm supposed to have some cookies
[523:23] in here
[523:27] yo content and we have a token in here
[523:32] right
[523:38] sweet now we need to connect that token
[523:47] so now we need to connect that okay then
[523:49] find a way to
[523:52] um link it to the user idea
[524:17] all right
[524:18] some kids
[526:09] I think
[526:22] okay
[526:34] um
[526:35] you know
[526:37] so wait that was for
[526:41] that's a login Road okay
[526:48] because here it so it creates okay so it
[526:51] creates a Json web token and it returns
[526:54] it as a cookie in the browser
[527:11] somehow we need to connect the cookie to
[527:14] a user ID and we need to save that user
[527:17] in the database when he signs up
[527:21] how would we do that huh
[527:54] like bathroom break I'll be right back
[536:38] [Music]
[536:38] um
[536:41] obviously this is not
[536:45] since I'm gone yeah that's another
[536:48] surprise
[538:34] foreign
[539:49] right this is going nowhere for now
[539:51] um I'm gonna get a little bit mad so I'm
[539:53] going to have a break actually I'm gonna
[539:56] go surf before it's dark
[539:58] uh let's see
[540:02] yeah I'm gonna go sir
[540:03] thank you everyone for tuning in um I'm
[540:05] going to leave the stream open and I'll
[540:07] be back when I'm done surfing
[540:10] hopefully I can find a fix uh obviously
[540:13] it's not going as the 30 wood
[540:17] so well I have no idea if I'm going to
[540:19] be able to keep going on that project or
[540:21] if I need to have a break
[540:23] but I'll be back tonight and if maybe
[540:25] something like two hours it's the time I
[540:27] I surf real quick I'll put the stream on
[540:30] pose and uh I'll see you around
[540:33] thanks for tuning in guys and thanks for
[540:35] everyone who's been helping it's been a
[540:37] really fun it's a really really fun day
[540:40] all right I'll see you later
[635:14] hello Twitter
[635:16] uh welcome back
[635:21] um so I've been thinking a bit
[635:23] um
[635:25] I think for now there is no
[635:27] um much sense to keep going with this
[635:30] streamer today uh as I'm struggling with
[635:33] uh
[635:34] the authentication flow and I honest I
[635:37] wanted to give you know some value for
[635:39] you and see the whole process of
[635:41] building a product but now I'm just
[635:42] stuck with something and I don't know
[635:43] how long it's gonna take
[635:45] so I'm going to pause the stream for now
[635:47] and I'm gonna catch up when whenever I
[635:51] fix the issue and I fix it on my on my
[635:53] side and um and then as I'm gonna start
[635:55] again as soon as we are fixed with it so
[635:59] um I don't know I expected to take a
[636:01] couple more hours tomorrow and hopefully
[636:03] I'll be live tomorrow somewhere
[636:05] and otherwise um I'm pretty sure it's
[636:07] going to be okay in two days
[636:09] um I thank you so much everyone for
[636:11] joining it was uh it was fun it was this
[636:13] super nice to see you all here and uh
[636:15] thank you so much also for the helps and
[636:17] the codes you guys have been sending
[636:18] it's just so helpful and it's really
[636:21] good
[636:23] um if you was if you were here earlier
[636:25] uh send me your Danny DM me on Twitter
[636:27] and uh DME whatever like hey or your
[636:30] Twitter uh username or something so that
[636:32] I remember to credit you on the landing
[636:34] page when the site is live uh you know
[636:36] like they do in the movies at the end
[636:39] um I just think it's fun because you
[636:40] guys have uh you know voted for the IDS
[636:43] and and shared some some codes and chips
[636:45] and stuff so uh
[636:47] I I think it's funny if it's like it has
[636:49] a the label uh
[636:51] crowdsourced by the building public
[636:53] Community or something
[636:55] so yeah
[636:57] um sorry again I thought it would go
[637:00] a different way I thought it would be
[637:01] easier than that uh I guess I'm still a
[637:04] new programmer
[637:05] but uh I'm gonna take a couple hours to
[637:08] uh you know learn that and and come back
[637:10] stronger I'll see you all and uh and
[637:13] thank you so much for tuning in see you
