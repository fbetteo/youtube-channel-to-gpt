[02:50] hello
[02:55] no
[02:56] hello
[04:05] I can support
[04:32] what are we gonna do okay
[04:35] as always let me know if the sound is
[04:37] good or no good
[04:39] ways we can just go back to building so
[04:41] we have uh
[04:43] this stuff here
[04:46] and I need to fix
[04:54] could not check okay
[05:04] be sure we get
[05:10] um premium
[05:20] Franco premium on the web normally we
[05:22] have payment clicks a really hard
[05:24] premium user
[05:25] I'll start there
[05:27] is a bit less
[05:32] um
[05:37] let me try and just to see
[05:44] working on the web I think
[05:48] oh no it's working
[05:51] okay testing here
[05:54] oh got it
[06:09] all right so what we need to do
[06:15] the sound keeps on cutting
[06:17] um
[06:19] [ __ ] hello Dave Dave
[06:22] I thought you were Dave
[06:23] and
[06:26] it inputs a bit higher
[06:30] obs
[06:32] about now is it
[06:34] um you know I try something a little bit
[06:36] different is it any better
[06:43] yep
[07:19] hey
[07:21] um I'm gonna try to put the app on my
[07:24] phone
[07:25] to see if we get something
[07:31] right so that's what it looks like on my
[07:34] phone
[07:37] up sorry
[07:42] oh one second I think someone at the
[07:45] door
[07:46] yep
[09:01] is that possible so for some reason
[09:07] I was able to log in the app
[09:10] on my phone there's no deep link
[09:13] in any way
[09:15] but Google offered me to login so I can
[09:19] connect on the app without even
[09:20] remembering a password which is done
[09:25] um
[09:28] I think I'll have to create a new
[09:30] account though
[09:33] I need a user
[09:35] first time user
[09:54] super fun
[09:56] hey
[09:59] create my avatar
[10:02] I create another Avatar and he's gonna
[10:04] give me here
[10:06] oh okay
[10:09] all right so the error is still here on
[10:12] Android I just cannot fetch the payments
[10:15] I think
[10:17] um
[10:18] it's about the revenue cat I'm gonna
[10:20] check also
[10:23] not this one
[10:27] yeah this one
[10:29] I'm gonna build you have an iPhone and
[10:32] see
[10:46] okay so here
[10:51] Sweet let's do okay I need to test this
[10:54] on my
[10:56] wife's iPhone when she's back
[10:59] please come back wife
[11:15] okay
[11:16] um
[11:18] restore field so in the premium we have
[11:21] the handle payment purchase package
[11:25] okay
[11:26] okay so it's gonna be a boring stuff but
[11:29] I need to make sure the service account
[11:31] credential is configure properly
[11:34] go back to my Play Store console
[11:45] uh nope
[11:47] the hero fit
[11:51] no I don't think it's there
[12:04] what does he say from my other app
[12:07] ears
[12:09] that he's cleared an Android
[12:16] connected
[12:18] in my public API key
[12:24] I think I have to step by step go back
[12:40] oh
[12:42] Google Play package that's probably the
[12:45] issue I had
[12:47] it's maybe fetching the wrong package
[12:50] my app is called
[13:00] okay let's give it a try
[13:06] maybe we can try again
[13:09] products
[13:12] yes okay that was the issue that was the
[13:14] wrong package name so
[13:16] hopefully now this should work better
[13:20] give it another try on my phone
[13:24] uh
[13:26] uh I create another Avatar
[13:32] there's an issues okay still nuts
[13:38] in River new cat there's an issue
[13:44] there's a premature configuration none
[13:45] of the project Rogers could be fetched
[13:47] from the Google Play
[13:50] offerings Mt
[13:55] and yeah Wolverines
[13:59] episode of get offerings
[14:03] um maybe we're just gonna check in the
[14:05] app
[14:07] let me set it up
[14:13] uh how does it work already
[14:16] it's big
[14:18] Android key we're going to get entered
[14:20] key
[14:22] just checking that's the right key that
[14:24] I'm not doing any
[14:25] similar mistake that I just did before
[14:31] interesting
[14:33] um
[14:37] public API key
[14:39] is okay yeah okay that's the one
[14:44] where is my Android key okay my layout
[14:51] if it's a native platform okay
[14:55] setup
[14:58] that Android key maybe we're just going
[15:01] to console logins for next time
[15:05] just to be sure we're setting up the
[15:07] right one I think so
[15:12] maybe we just
[15:22] enable true
[15:25] I'm just going to do this instead
[15:30] oh yeah that's the right one
[15:35] uh remember your kid that Android key
[15:38] and you say you cannot find
[15:41] go back at it
[15:44] none of the product according to get
[15:46] dashboard could be fetched from the Play
[15:48] Store
[15:52] products this one cannot be fetched from
[15:56] the play store but you're telling me
[15:57] that the store status is okay
[16:03] come on
[16:09] maybe we uninstall the app because it
[16:11] cached something for some reason
[16:16] even another try
[16:23] there's an issues Adventure
[16:27] and none of the products never really
[16:29] just are working fish from the Play
[16:30] Store
[16:52] which is strange because it works for
[16:54] iOS
[16:57] and the config is exactly the same
[17:04] did I change something I was just going
[17:06] to reveal the app and see
[17:08] yep oh yeah okay I can sync
[17:13] mobile
[17:16] um it would be interesting to uninstall
[17:18] the app first
[17:21] you know fit
[17:25] uninstall the buyer
[17:29] um same here what we can do is we can
[17:31] eventually maybe I just clean
[17:35] I don't know if this is going to do
[17:36] anything
[17:38] then I'm gonna do npx
[17:41] open Android
[17:50] go there
[17:53] okay
[17:54] [Music]
[17:54] um
[17:56] wireless keyboard game

[18:23] rebuild the app
[18:29] and put it on my phone
[18:43] all right so that's here
[18:47] I'm gonna log in
[18:54] ah still nuts
[19:01] [ __ ]
[19:35] I need to check on Revenue cut that I
[19:37] didn't make any mistake uh Play Store
[20:17] the hero feed app
[20:19] and here API access

[20:35] the stuff

[36:12] include probably username and passwords
[36:16] okay
[36:25] okay so I'm gonna have to give you the
[36:27] hero
[36:29] and I'm gonna have to sign up with a
[36:32] Google
[36:34] that's email.com

[36:59] accounts
[37:02] login
[37:13] Okay Google that

[38:10] um how far I am
[38:13] uh trying to get the payment running on
[38:15] Android they have a little issue with it
[38:17] but it's working on the web and it's
[38:18] also working on iOS
[38:20] as soon as I get the payment stuff
[38:22] running I'm gonna submit the app to the
[38:24] stores the app or the overall app is
[38:26] finished I'm going to submit it to the
[38:27] stores a bit maybe it's a bit too early
[38:29] but I need to because the first couple
[38:30] days are usually uh like usually a while
[38:33] and I'm probably gonna get rejected
[38:34] anyway so I need to see what's going on
[38:37] and then um I'm gonna finish a few
[38:39] features
[38:41] wait for the App Stores review and move
[38:43] on with the product and launch

[68:58] no
[69:07] [Music]
[69:35] achieved
[70:14] and change the inside the text now
[70:19] [ __ ] I'm gonna have to create an image
[70:21] for every stuff uh what else the Emoji
[70:23] are fun
[70:28] are they running because it's very
[70:29] common Sports
[70:51] now I didn't want to close that
[70:59] go back
[71:25] maybe we align on the bottom
[71:29] uh that makes more sense
[71:37] all right I wish I knew a little bit
[71:38] better figma so I could align everything
[71:40] on the same line
[71:43] easily without struggling like that
[72:12] all right I think there will be like a
[72:14] such a simpler way to do these on
[72:15] figment I'm a noob
[72:18] [ __ ]
[72:32] all right it doesn't look super nice but
[72:34] enough I think
[73:01] I think it was better before
[73:16] damn I'm such a noob in figma
[73:21] this is dirty
[73:25] all right I think they'll do it
[73:36] oh okay thanks man thanks lace
[73:41] oh yeah I'll put it lower
[73:46] all right it's much lower let me know if
[73:48] that's any better
[73:53] app icon
[73:56] we are hero feed public
[74:01] here is the logo feature graphic
[74:09] oh okay
[74:38] nice logo
[74:42] you did not download the logo Maybe
[74:46] you did it's here
[74:57] um oh maybe we can also do this one the
[75:00] one we use for
[75:03] sure main okay Yep this is gonna be the
[75:06] one
[75:10] um
[75:34] why I just cannot select
[75:38] I don't want to pick you up I just want
[75:39] to take what's inside oh I put them out
[75:42] that's why
[76:03] maybe I'm getting
[76:05] uh maybe I'm bothering maybe I can just
[76:08] do something like this
[76:14] yeah I think we're not gonna build her
[76:16] too much
[76:18] we're gonna do this
[76:26] and it's perfectly not aligned
[76:30] it's gonna be all right we're gonna put
[76:32] it here here of it public
[76:43] I'm gonna do this too
[76:53] um so now we have to just keep the color
[77:04] um
[77:04] I would do this
[77:09] how about we put uh document color
[77:16] all right it's perfect but it's fun
[77:19] um
[77:21] maybe two or three screenshots
[77:30] uh
[77:32] I'm gonna go too far into the game
[77:36] sign up
[77:48] choose a month 37 now oh maybe I can use
[77:52] the intro read on my phone for the
[77:53] screenshots
[77:56] so it looks like the really Android
[77:58] icons
[78:00] doesn't really matter
[78:04] create a sport Avatar okay
[78:08] a little lifter
[78:10] where is the catch the rock yeah

[78:21] um
[78:31] your workout Avatar

[78:36] probable
[78:56] I think we're going to just go with two
[78:58] screenshots do we need three two one
[79:06] anyway
[79:07] um push bullets
[79:12] send photo
[79:22] hopefully I'll get those stuff here
[79:25] uh because I'm not lucky enough to have
[79:28] a iPhone device I rely on these like
[79:32] plugin stuff so I can pass
[79:35] stuff between my phone and my computer
[79:40] okay and figma we're gonna take those
[79:44] screenshots and put them in here
[79:50] and in
[79:52] it's not the one

[80:19] you know maybe we're going to fill it
[80:21] with this
[80:28] oh all right look
[80:36] right to this
[80:39] so it looks exactly like we have
[80:42] uh what do we have to take somewhere in

[82:27] exercise to level them up get a workout
[82:29] avatars exercise to level them up
[82:32] right this is not
[82:36] crazy good looking but it's gonna do the
[82:39] work

[82:42] so now I should be able to
[82:45] submit

[85:05] roll out to close testing in review okay
[85:11] the track is active that's what we
[85:13] wanted temporary app name come and
[85:15] reviewed
[85:18] see what's missing you shouldn't come
[85:21] from the release
[85:24] uh maybe you can even do an open testing
[85:27] one I want to see it doesn't matter
[85:35] right I submitted every
[85:37] tracks
[85:42] I haven't submitted a prediction release
[85:44] but
[85:49] really set up a go play okay
[85:52] just checking the main store listing
[85:54] should be good
[85:56] right
[86:05] are you a public after the life

[86:27] same but it's actually day one two three
[86:29] four
[86:31] um you can go back in time this is when
[86:34] we just started the very beginning I
[86:36] don't know if that's any interest
[86:37] because it's quite long but if you want
[86:39] to go back there you can uh you can go

[87:11] so normally when you double check is
[87:14] Backward Compatible monsie portrayal

[87:21] issue it doesn't find
[87:23] the products
[87:28] back
[87:34] it doesn't find the products why
[87:42] Android app

[88:45] inner defined for the
[88:48] it's supposed to be working but it's not

[88:59] my offering identifier
[89:04] hero feed premium
[89:07] okay
[89:09] hero beats premium
[89:16] the offering discipline Origins if I
[89:18] already exists for this app
[89:24] arent can also be used for tests
[89:29] oh okay no I'm stupid okay yeah the same
[89:32] offering I need to just to order
[89:34] lifetime description uh European premium
[89:43] okay
[89:45] attach okay and I choose a product this
[89:47] one and this one
[89:49] okay now we have it on both IOS and
[89:52] Android
[89:53] and now we are also going to say
[89:57] this offering
[90:02] yeah okay that works
[90:07] okay we should be good to go I'm gonna
[90:08] give it another try on Android Studio
[90:10] I'm gonna reveal the app on my phone
[90:14] see if I can actually make a purchase
[90:16] with just accounts
[90:23] hello you're not happy what's going on
[90:26] or are you application already failed oh
[90:29] yeah I have the this version installed
[90:31] so I need to delete it
[90:36] uninstall
[90:40] cancel
[90:44] again
[90:50] oh I need my wife's iPhone as well
[91:01] okay okay
[91:04] okay I think it's working
[91:07] I have the price somewhere in there so
[91:10] it's actually fetching the right data
[91:13] and if I go there yeah
[91:15] it's working airplane premium
[91:20] okay so now I need to make the back-end
[91:22] stuff to make sure that we get the we
[91:25] turn on the Boolean in the database
[91:28] this is good this is good this is moving
[91:30] forward maybe we'll be able to ship on
[91:31] the stores today
[91:32] um
[91:33] I do the same on habits Garden another
[91:36] app I I own and I'm going to copy the
[91:40] code
[91:41] I will need uh
[91:44] I'll need to set up on that thing I'll
[91:48] need to tell
[91:50] that give me a second I will need to
[91:53] reveal some API keys
[91:55] instead I'm going to show you my stupid
[91:57] face
[91:59] hello
[92:01] super awkward
[92:05] uh where are those API Keys bro
[92:09] server
[92:10] Revenue cats oh the key and header
[92:21] and we gotta put them in here
[92:29] and the header
[92:33] I don't know this is not what I'm
[92:34] looking for I'm gonna check for this
[92:52] um
[92:53] this is the one we're talking about
[93:01] so I'll need to create these and I will
[93:05] need
[93:06] also to create okay
[93:15] so here
[93:18] no API key I'm gonna create one
[93:21] reversal
[93:31] okay I have my API key set up here
[93:33] and I also need
[93:36] to set up the Web book integration
[93:47] settings
[93:49] web hook
[93:51] URL the hero feeds
[93:55] app.api that's webhook
[93:58] Slash RC
[94:35] um
[94:43] so I've added the webbook
[94:46] almost done
[94:48] environment variables we have this here
[94:54] there's secrets
[94:56] Bingo and here C
[95:10] Ave them
[95:13] oh [ __ ] I put them in the wrong
[95:20] seal header removed
[95:24] and go back to my apps
[95:27] little feet
[95:36] and another
[95:38] secrets
[95:56] okay batch
[95:59] screen so I'm just setting up the
[96:03] variables I'll need on the back end to
[96:05] receive web hooks from hero
[96:10] from robbery cat to turn on the Boolean
[96:12] in the database
[96:14] uh
[96:16] [ __ ] I just like all my API Keys [ __ ]
[96:19] that's it reset those
[96:28] [ __ ]
[96:30] [ __ ]
[96:32] that's pretty annoying stuff
[96:49] I find it so annoying
[97:02] set this letter that doesn't matter
[97:19] API keys
[97:22] edit
[97:26] so I'll revoke
[97:32] uh versa
[97:55] save
[98:42] turkey okay
[98:45] potential my API Keys that's the
[98:48] annoying part of streaming
[98:51] um
[98:53] look
[98:54] so
[98:59] we need to set up the web hook or
[99:01] next year yes uh we're gonna set it up
[99:04] along with stripe rc.js
[99:08] and we're gonna copy past something that
[99:10] I use in other apps
[99:14] um
[99:15] I have access installed here
[99:17] yep
[99:24] we don't need logger the config will
[99:26] catch different different okay
[99:30] and how does it work again on XCS I need
[99:33] to do
[99:35] this
[99:38] instead of
[99:40] this stuff
[99:49] this work now it's a function
[99:53] here
[99:54] such thing
[99:57] exports
[100:00] um
[100:12] requested header so in stripe we have to
[100:15] make sure I think we need to use the
[100:16] Buddy passer stuff
[100:20] see how that works
[100:23] header
[100:30] buffer from negro
[100:37] requested headers.authorization
[100:41] requisite header
[100:45] okay the authorization or requested her
[100:48] reservation
[100:50] equal
[100:52] is not equal to process
[100:57] I just called it again I called it
[101:01] where is it
[101:05] RC dot oauth header
[101:08] config process
[101:11] dot
[101:14] environments.grc.hof header
[101:18] and maybe
[101:22] the boring stuff for running cat both
[101:26] better
[101:28] equal process
[101:33] dot RC oath header and then whatever you
[101:37] get
[101:39] gonna do
[101:41] import
[101:43] config
[101:46] and we're gonna do
[101:47] Big Dot Revenue cats dot oath
[101:53] of it array I already said that the both
[101:56] header
[101:57] okay
[102:00] install.log
[102:03] rest dot status
[102:06] send
[102:09] so this is okay
[102:13] config oh
[102:16] how do I do this stripe
[102:19] don't need a change name I think I need
[102:22] to keep the config one
[102:28] um
[102:33] is it named exports I don't know
[102:37] things
[102:39] it's a bit ugly
[102:41] or maybe I'll just do this Revenue get
[102:45] so I can do this
[102:50] I could try
[102:52] oh request it buddy so that's the part
[102:53] where we need to check because it's a
[102:56] bit different from Express on node.js
[102:59] and API on xjs I need to do this
[103:05] and then my buffer
[103:10] I don't
[103:12] know
[103:23] okay
[103:26] all right I'm gonna go on post for the
[103:27] stream guys I'm having the witchy family
[103:29] call I'll be back in 30 minutes to one
[103:31] hour and we're gonna finish that app see
[103:34] you
[161:12] welcome back to the Stream
[161:19] okay the hero feeder tab that API Dot
[161:23] book dot Revenue cat
[161:27] uh
[161:29] you're not supposed to send me back
[161:31] something here
[161:36] your sequel to send me back this thing
[161:38] buddy
[161:42] oh
[161:46] okay that makes sense
[161:51] um now we need to make some tests so
[161:55] I'm gonna check the logs
[162:01] what is
[162:06] 12 for when you get that makes sense
[162:09] um I'm gonna test the app
[162:19] [Music]
[162:21] I'm gonna test the uh
[162:31] yeah so I have the app installed on my
[162:33] phone normally I should be able to
[162:35] subscribe to the paid plan
[162:39] another test stuff and revenue cats
[162:43] this thing here
[162:45] it's supposed to
[162:48] um just accept like receive the stuff oh
[162:51] yeah we're gonna check here
[162:58] um
[163:00] where is it I just want to see the logs
[163:02] now okay those logs so here we're going
[163:05] to be able to see the which one is this
[163:11] bro I just want to see the logs for
[163:16] cards
[163:18] how do I turn on this thing again
[163:21] well that's my Revenue it's fun let's
[163:23] see
[163:26] oh wow okay I'm discovering some stuff
[163:29] about my app
[163:35] I turn on the sandbox data
[163:40] art nope
[163:43] I got paid today
[163:45] incomplete
[163:48] that what it means
[163:51] oh wow so nice new customer nice
[163:56] uh and choose no
[163:59] that'd be weird
[164:03] customers
[164:05] oh maybe the hero feed
[164:09] sandbox
[164:11] foreign
[164:16] maybe we are going to check the database
[164:22] let me just check if you guys I can
[164:24] actually see something
[164:26] okay
[164:35] [ __ ]
[164:43] each hero
[164:49] it's pretty slow
[164:51] browse collection
[164:56] here we're going to take the users so
[165:01] who am I in the database
[165:05] name there's so many users
[165:09] America Los Angeles oh someone trying to
[165:11] use the app
[165:15] what is in my name here settings
[165:17] one.marclue.com
[165:21] okay that's the user we're talking about
[165:23] so we're going to do email
[165:31] that's my user ID so normally this guy
[165:37] will be somewhere
[165:41] in here
[165:43] the user has been created it's a test
[165:46] user oh save those data
[165:49] oh okay now I can see that
[165:55] so once again I'm gonna go back
[165:58] and I'm going to pray that when I'm
[166:00] going to purchase a package for tests on
[166:02] my phone it should update the database
[166:04] by going through my virtual API
[166:07] One Tap byte
[166:09] payment successful yay
[166:13] more logs within the limited time
[166:17] enough fresh
[166:21] past 30 minutes you're supposed to have
[166:23] a log somewhere
[166:28] I think we're just gonna go directly in
[166:30] the database
[166:31] if it works for the first time this is a
[166:34] beautiful day
[166:38] remember I had to retype everything
[166:49] he's premium thoughts so obviously
[166:51] something didn't work
[166:53] um the weird part is we don't have I'll
[166:56] show new lungs maybe we have something
[166:57] here
[166:58] okay we have a authorization issue
[167:02] what do we get
[167:05] it's the first day so it doesn't make
[167:07] sense if you worked right away
[167:08] be a bit too easy
[167:11] authorization okay
[167:15] it's a trick Trace cannot tree property
[167:17] of oath hitter okay
[167:20] you cannot read properties of undefined
[167:24] so this thing here
[167:29] I think
[167:32] for the new kit
[167:33] both header
[167:36] we're gonna console like it and so vlog
[167:40] you get
[167:42] and we're going to use the classic
[167:44] Postman stuff hey Google
[167:47] play The Blaze
[167:54] knucklesh API webwork Revenue cats
[168:04] and normally we're supposed to see the
[168:06] logs oh no one that's
[168:08] actually coming
[168:11] am I really wish we can submit today
[168:16] okay let's try again
[168:19] Revenue cat is undefined
[168:23] I have a mark you made something wrong
[168:25] of course
[168:27] um
[168:31] yeah

[168:37] name is
[168:47] important
[168:55] easy I guess
[169:02] oh
[169:23] zero
[169:25] big
[169:30] I cannot do that to get from uh come on
[169:34] it's for default function
[169:51] maybe I say just something fun
[170:04] okay I can just name it whatever
[170:07] Jersey mark

[172:58] yeah sometimes that stuff doesn't work
[173:01] it's a bit annoying
[173:06] but at least we don't need
[173:10] a cable like we do in iOS
[173:13] I wouldn't complain
[173:27] okay
[173:36] come on connect me
[173:41] okay connected
[173:44] build again
[173:52] Wendy's
[173:54] all right
[173:56] again we're going to check if this is
[173:58] completed in the database
[174:06] uh Go premium Port change that's a
[174:09] premium
[174:12] line
[174:13] oh we need to remove that thing a
[174:17] furnace that you feed no social headache
[174:18] Supreme
[174:21] Let's Go premium
[174:28] okay purchased
[174:31] let's see versal if you see something
[174:34] that will be some new deployment
[174:40] ready logs
[174:42] no red that's a good thing
[174:46] let's see we're gonna refresh
[174:56] let me just refresh yeah oh okay maybe
[174:59] next time
[175:04] um user ID refresh
[175:07] still false something went wrong
[175:11] I think that's the one we did wrong
[175:13] warning
[175:14] a book signature failed for Revenue kit
[175:19] Okay so
[175:24] Maybe
[175:26] maybe maybe
[175:38] I think he doesn't get the headers
[175:40] properly
[175:42] or are we we are
[175:45] um
[175:46] RC
[175:48] requested headers
[175:52] oh okay I locked that thing there so
[175:54] normally I should be able to see what I
[175:55] got
[175:56] oh yeah that's the headers okay
[175:58] request.headers and request body
[176:01] so I think it hosts the hero feed takes
[176:04] authorization
[176:06] requested headers okay
[176:16] Excel so that's all headers and there is
[176:19] nobody
[176:22] that's weird oh probably because I
[176:25] didn't but for the Buddy probably the
[176:27] Buddy gonna be later
[176:30] okay so request that header the
[176:32] authorization we have requests
[176:34] we have logging headers we're supposed
[176:36] to have authorization here okay
[176:40] uh request a equal Barrel dots on feed
[176:45] five Revenue cats that oath hitter
[176:48] but she's
[176:50] Revenue cat that oath hitter
[176:55] okay
[176:58] and I'm showing right I'm gonna have to
[177:00] change this later
[177:02] normally if I go to my versal
[177:06] no this other one
[177:08] he doesn't have the word verb
[177:15] request letter
[177:19] authorization
[177:23] oh I think that's how I set up my
[177:27] project
[177:33] oh yeah I think I know
[177:40] web hook
[177:42] all right give me a second guys I just
[177:44] need to turn on a few stuff
[177:49] you get to see my nice stupid face while
[177:51] I'm doing this
[177:55] I should be original shredders
[177:58] oh okay I think I I missed
[178:01] the
[178:04] stuff
[178:09] hit it here
[178:16] all right so I'm gonna have to change
[178:17] the name
[178:19] of the headers because it's gonna it's
[178:22] leaking everywhere on YouTube
[178:25] uh
[178:27] error
[179:18] maybe it's just not in there
[179:50] with this maybe
[180:22] all right welcome back stream I just
[180:24] changed a few config stuff
[180:28] let's see if that works
[180:30] so this is still building
[180:49] all right we're live so we can try
[180:52] uh my web hooks
[180:55] and send a test we're working instead of
[180:57] testing stupidly with my stuff
[181:00] but it's
[181:02] you didn't like it
[181:05] I won't show me what's going on
[181:10] blogger is not defined I was actually
[181:12] talking logo
[181:15] RC looker
[181:19] person that Define
[181:23] edot message I think where would have
[181:27] got an error I think maybe I have an
[181:28] error somewhere here
[181:44] um
[181:47] so
[181:51] option
[181:53] authorization
[181:55] Bearer awarded
[182:04] another mistake
[182:08] what is going on
[182:38] do you have
[182:40] settings environment variables
[182:43] you have RC both hitter
[182:48] fiction
[182:50] we have to change this afterward
[182:56] supposed to know that right
[183:13] yeah
[183:15] that's for another date okay I'm getting
[183:17] two or two okay empty
[183:19] so we can try again
[183:23] Let's uh I'm gonna purchase again the
[183:26] package
[183:28] and see what's going on
[183:35] so full so it's not working
[183:39] um what do we have
[183:46] Cubans
[183:56] so what's going on so if you don't have
[183:59] if it doesn't work I kick you out then
[184:02] we try something
[184:04] oh maybe there is just an error okay
[184:09] so we log the headers line
[184:12] and the buffer Canada's richer app ID of
[184:15] both of the events as it is undefined
[184:21] cannot distract your property app ID
[184:24] ents
[184:27] this is undefined and the buff here that
[184:30] we have
[184:31] equals that thing
[184:50] of the data above the type
[184:58] third requests
[185:00] the request that body was undefined
[185:05] fine okay we don't need to parse the
[185:06] body
[185:07] I can try this instead you'll need the
[185:10] header
[185:12] we don't need this and maybe we don't
[185:15] need
[185:15] just request that buddy
[185:19] and replace every block by request
[185:22] ability
[185:28] okay
[185:30] uh
[185:36] we're going to get there
[185:38] it's gonna work at some points
[186:13] okay versus ready we're gonna set a test
[186:15] web hook
[186:16] see if we get something
[186:22] again
[186:27] response okay
[186:34] RC what do we have test object ID field
[186:38] or
[186:41] okay
[186:43] oh we don't need that okay that's
[186:45] perfect we don't need to do the buffer
[186:46] stuff we did for Stripes so
[186:48] you can just change it on the big fine
[186:54] um so we have the Buddy properly buddy
[186:57] that events that
[186:59] where is the user ID that user ID okay
[187:04] thing

[214:22] the mic so I'll catch you up with my
[214:25] computer mic
[214:35] can you hear me now

[215:21] work
[216:05] and then continue
[216:08] sorry the sound man is not really good
[216:10] uh it's going well I'm done with the
[216:11] payments so you can purchase an IOS and
[216:13] Android

[216:22] everything is fine and then
[216:25] if it is fine I'm going to submit on the
[216:28] stores
[216:29] kind of exciting the app is not perfect
[216:31] I need to improve a lot of stuff but I
[216:33] think I'm going to submit a first
[216:34] version with uh nothing much inside
[216:38] and uh because the first review always
[216:40] takes some time and then I will just
[216:42] iterate and move on based on what they
[216:45] say
[216:51] it works

[217:36] isn't a web app why calling it startup
[217:40] well I I don't think startup word matter
[217:43] much I think it what matters is like uh

[217:48] uh in exchange of a payment
[217:53] does it come oh you don't want to accept
[217:54] that thing something went wrong

[234:08] have to manually manage the expiry email
[234:10] or all these logic ethos
[234:11] [Music]
[234:13] I don't know which uh kind of product
[234:16] you're selling for me I'm selling a
[234:18] one-time purchase so people pay with the
[234:20] payment link it sends a message to my
[234:22] web Hook and the web hook verifies the
[234:25] user ID and then it turns on a Boolean
[234:27] in the database I also have stripe setup
[234:29] for subscriptions and straight basically
[234:31] managed to renew the subscriptions every
[234:33] month they charge the credit card and if
[234:35] there are issues or whatever stripes in
[234:38] the events and my backend check the
[234:40] events I receive and make sure that the
[234:43] user is still paying and if it's not
[234:45] then my backend will just turn off the
[234:46] Boolean I don't know if that answer your
[234:48] question man
[234:50] stupid
[234:55] the back
[234:58] they should be awesome you too man
[235:03] okay I think we are good
[235:05] um
[235:06] what I see here is
[235:08] I was able to purchase the package on
[235:09] the app
[235:11] uh the app is not super amazing I think
[235:15] I will need to redo a little bit of work
[235:17] on the flow the UI and stuff
[235:21] but we can submit the app
[235:23] at least
[235:24] uh
[235:26] so yeah let's do that
[235:29] let's submit that thing
[235:34] to be weird because uh
[235:36] I don't know if it's uh I don't know how
[235:39] how it's gonna work or anything but uh
[235:42] I think it has everything it needs
[235:49] I think it has everything it needs
[235:58] I'm trying to analyze the potential
[236:01] cases of uh
[236:04] um
[236:05] you know like sometimes they reject you
[236:07] because you use the word Android and iOS
[236:10] more things I'm trying to visualize
[236:16] no I think this is fine I think this is
[236:18] fine we're gonna run the last build and

[236:21] get loading oh yeah we have the loading
[236:23] stuff

[243:04] active perfect
[243:07] I think we're good for Android
[243:09] you can close that
[243:10] oh there's something that I need and if
[243:12] I've always been caught up with uh Apple
[243:17] um
[243:18] I need to do
[243:21] this stuff here if you don't put
[243:25] in the app description if you don't put
[243:28] this you're gonna get rejected which
[243:29] doesn't make any sense you could just
[243:31] add an input somewhere and tell you to
[243:33] do it before but no
[243:36] just copy past the description from
[243:38] there
[243:42] oh recently one of my good rejection
[243:44] because I was using energy everything
[243:46] Christmas I mean Emoji as app icon image
[243:48] oh that's a good point okay so oh [ __ ]
[243:52] that's fine so you
[243:55] you think for this we'll get because
[243:58] this is an uh iOS Emoji you think it
[244:01] will get rejected because of that
[244:03] okay that would that would actually suck
[244:12] because I think I'm pretty sure uh Apple
[244:16] would refuse if we put Android emojis on
[244:18] their platform but
[244:20] I'm not sure I have to resubmit again
[244:21] okay
[244:24] by any chance do you remember when they
[244:26] rejected you whether they said that
[244:28] because you have an an emoji that is not
[244:31] from the platform they didn't Etc app
[244:34] get something like this maybe I just
[244:36] change it right away
[244:39] yeah it's a great Avatar it's a case of
[244:42] an iPhone we are going to do
[244:45] uh
[244:49] the hero
[244:58] normally we have the privacy policy here
[245:02] and the terms of services here
[245:06] okay
[245:07] so take your workout Avatar the trouble
[245:12] or an expensive size level up grow your
[245:14] avatar
[245:17] and please
[245:22] big
[245:23] working out
[245:26] again
[245:34] I know there's such a goal okay
[245:37] what a wonderful copywriting
[245:41] yo Matisse
[245:43] Garcia make
[245:48] good morning man
[245:50] um ideas I don't really know I think
[245:53] building stuff makes me
[245:56] create some IDs
[245:58] honestly I don't
[246:00] think my IDs are great but just they
[246:02] come up and and I build them and more
[246:06] comes
[246:07] and then I couple you know sometimes I
[246:09] can like oh I like this technology and
[246:11] how can I apply it for some area so
[246:15] I don't know if there is a proper answer
[246:16] to that I have a list that I've been
[246:18] growing for maybe 10 years or something
[246:21] where every time I have a startup ID or
[246:23] just an idea whatever to like start a
[246:24] YouTube channel about this or that I put
[246:27] it on the list
[246:28] and the lease keeps growing over the
[246:30] years and whenever I feel like I have
[246:32] time I pick a startup and I try to build
[246:33] it
[246:38] what's uh what's my uh
[246:48] they come with ideas on Twitter
[246:50] um I don't how do how do I come in here
[246:54] uh what happened in the past is just I
[246:57] know it's been six or seven years I'm
[246:58] building some apps
[247:00] previously kind of like a
[247:04] in in my room without telling anyone you
[247:07] know thinking like I have the next big
[247:09] unicorn and being super ambitious
[247:11] and then I did that for a couple years
[247:13] uh it never really worked I got some
[247:15] money but it's nothing crazy but he
[247:18] didn't feel good at all and then about a
[247:20] year and a half ago I studied to build
[247:21] in public on Twitter
[247:23] and I have way less ambition and just
[247:26] make startups whenever I could
[247:28] and this is working much better for me
[247:33] I know I I work with capacitor uh just
[247:36] that stuff that allows me to from HTML
[247:40] I just run a couple lines of code and it
[247:42] creates a bundle for IOS and Android
[247:44] all right I'm gonna check what you said
[247:47] on Twitter MC
[247:49] [Music]
[247:54] oh
[247:59] oh
[248:08] that's your app installation elements
[248:10] and that means to primarily two to
[248:12] therefore
[248:13] appeal primarily too
[248:16] therefore the target age group just say
[248:18] t are an accurate
[248:24] maybe you you want to check uh
[248:29] check I forget where he was at some
[248:32] point in your app you can tell who is
[248:34] your target audience
[248:37] like whether you're targeting minus like
[248:39] people who are under 13 years old 13 to
[248:41] 14 18 plus something I did just 18 plus
[248:45] I don't Target people who are under 18
[248:48] and they say like could your app appeal
[248:50] to a younger audience and they say if
[248:54] you're not sure say yes and I say yes to
[248:56] that it looks like your issue is related
[248:58] to that somehow
[249:00] anyway character in the app icon
[249:03] animated character in the icon
[249:06] and maybe they're trying to tell you
[249:08] that these could appeal to kids
[249:10] that are young because it looks like a
[249:12] character of a game or something and
[249:15] then they think that you know your app
[249:17] could Target people who are young and I
[249:19] mean actually too young for for your app
[249:21] or something that's what I understand
[249:22] from this
[249:28] is

[285:52] there we go
[285:58] there we go submitted to the stores
[286:03] both IOS and Android
[286:06] waiting for review and in review
[286:09] so yeah definitely not crazy perfect
[286:14] but at least it is working
[286:17] it is submitted let's go yeah let's hope
[286:20] they they they're kind with us
[286:23] we're gonna get something out there
[286:27] um
[286:28] no I think I'm just gonna tweet it and
[286:30] go enjoy my weekend I'll be back
[286:32] tomorrow for the stream of course
[286:36] it's really the case
[286:38] maybe oh yeah we're gonna do this
[286:44] and enter it
[286:46] stores
[286:48] submitted
[286:52] 30 30 US Energy reading apps are
[286:55] submitted
[286:56] you you've been three hours this crazy
[287:00] yeah I mean put it that way uh 30 hours
[287:04] for the app it seems like a lot
[287:08] and uh yeah I got some issues with some
[287:11] stuff I learned earlier so maybe the
[287:13] next one will be faster I think I'm
[287:15] gonna keep doing those lives for a
[287:17] little while to get used to it and build
[287:19] mini apps here and there
[287:21] um so yeah we're we're submitted the app
[287:25] I'm gonna turn off the screen
[287:27] um I'm gonna tune up tomorrow the goal
[287:30] now is I'm waiting for feedback for the
[287:31] stores because I doubt we're going to be
[287:33] accepted in production for the first
[287:35] submission
[287:37] um what I'm gonna do is tomorrow I'll
[287:40] show up and I'm gonna start to do some
[287:42] improvement on the app a few things
[287:44] that's going to happen I'm going to add
[287:46] a social login like Google or something
[287:47] because it's very annoying to log in
[287:49] with emails
[287:51] um I'm also going to have to build a
[287:52] landing page because now the landing
[287:54] page looks like this
[287:55] which doesn't matter for the submission
[287:57] and IOS and Android because they don't
[287:58] see it but at some points we'll need to
[288:01] launch on product 10 so we'll need a
[288:02] proper setting page editing page and
[288:05] then as soon as this is all done I'm
[288:08] going to shoot a video I think I'll take
[288:10] a day or so
[288:11] or
[288:13] um or just a fun video I don't know what
[288:15] it's going to be I think it's gonna be a
[288:18] video with the rock the public
[288:20] personality uh something fun something
[288:22] that lasts 30 seconds just for the
[288:24] product title product hunt launch
[288:27] and and we're gonna end up in this
[288:30] stream will be over the day I will be
[288:32] launching on product and I think I'm
[288:33] gonna stream the product hunt launch day
[288:36] even though it's not super interesting
[288:38] but whatever and the purpose was to
[288:40] finish the whole process we're now on
[288:42] day four
[288:43] and I hope if you know the gods are nice
[288:46] with us we get accepted and we can
[288:48] submit on day seven that would be
[288:49] amazing otherwise
[288:51] um I'll submit as soon as I get accepted
