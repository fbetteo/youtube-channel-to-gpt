[00:14] streaming streaming streaming and
[00:15] sending
[00:18] data Bingo okay we are live welcome back
[00:22] everyone it is day eight of building a
[00:25] little software um in public here on
[00:28] YouTube twitch and Twitter
[00:30] uh we are coding from scratch a no code
[00:33] tool to help stripe users manage their
[00:36] invoices without having to pay the fee
[00:39] to stripe and I'm going to go over that
[00:41] in a minute uh if you have no clue who I
[00:44] am my name is Mark I live in B and I
[00:47] started building a small side projects
[00:49] in public on Twitter uh two years ago um
[00:52] I'm coding really tiny projects like
[00:55] those ones I have 21 running at the
[00:57] moment um some of them never made money
[01:00] some of them did and now I have about
[01:03] six that are generating Revenue uh for
[01:07] $57,000 last month and one of the most
[01:10] common requests I get in my emails is
[01:13] can I get an invoice and as a stripe
[01:15] user strip will charge you 0.4% of your
[01:20] Revenue per invoice uh up to $2 uh which
[01:24] um is very pricey so I am building a
[01:28] little alternative to that
[01:30] and it's called Zenvo it is a no code
[01:33] tool it connects to a stripe account or
[01:35] to multiple actually to any stripe
[01:37] accounts you can have as many as you
[01:39] want you securly connect with restricted
[01:43] API Keys uh you have all your strip
[01:45] accounts on the left and then you have a
[01:47] unique link that you can send to your
[01:49] customers and your customers can uh
[01:51] securly retrieve all the payments they
[01:53] made with your business and um view
[01:56] generate and edit and download their
[01:58] invoices so this is a local uh testing
[02:01] but just to show you um this all these
[02:04] are fake uh payments that I made and you
[02:07] can see here um I can see my invoice I
[02:10] have all the business details here this
[02:11] is prepopulated even if stripe did not
[02:14] generate an invoice for the business for
[02:16] the customer um it will appear here and
[02:19] the customer can edit their information
[02:21] they can say uh you know whatever their
[02:23] name is marlu and their vat details is 1
[02:28] to3 um this is used tool especially if
[02:30] you work with European customers who
[02:31] need to add their V their business ID
[02:34] tax ID whatever to their invoice and
[02:36] they can download it and bingo they have
[02:39] an invoice that is ready to show to
[02:41] their accountant or
[02:44] whatever this pretty much what we've
[02:46] been doing so um we have built the
[02:49] product in day 1 to six um yesterday we
[02:52] made the Ling page uh it's a very raw
[02:56] version It's not finished but it is
[02:58] functional
[03:00] you can see here this is what I'm going
[03:02] to be finishing today this will be the
[03:04] last day of coding um I think after that
[03:08] we should be done the product is working
[03:10] um I'm now sending it to a few friends
[03:11] of mine who are STP customers and are in
[03:14] need of the product so I can get that
[03:15] testimonial and so we have um social
[03:18] proof on the landing page today I'm
[03:19] going to be editing a few pieces of the
[03:21] landing page I actually have a list of
[03:24] things we have to go over right
[03:27] here and yeah that's pretty much it
[03:30] um if you are joining the live please
[03:32] let me know how is the quality of the
[03:34] audio how is the quality of the stream
[03:36] uh let me know also what you guys are
[03:37] building if you're from Twitter I bet
[03:39] you have some ideas in your mind let me
[03:43] know if
[03:44] everything is working and I should have
[03:47] the chat normally on my phone so I
[03:49] should be able to see the messages here
[03:51] I I think my YouTube channel is getting
[03:54] monetized yesterday I think I received
[03:55] an email from them saying that and get
[03:58] supers or stuff whatever so I'm very
[04:01] curious this is the first time this
[04:02] happens so maybe the stream interface on
[04:06] YouTube will look a little bit different
[04:08] this time there might be some super
[04:09] stuff whatever uh not I'm not saying you
[04:12] that you should send me supers but I'm
[04:14] very curious how that looks like maybe
[04:16] I'll I'll give it a little shot on the
[04:20] phone so I'm going to share the link for
[04:23] people joining on
[04:25] Twitter there we
[04:27] go is the quality is actually much
[04:31] better on YouTube better
[04:34] quality on
[04:38] YouTube I'm awake early for this one yep
[04:41] Bingo man um yeah today I was supposed
[04:44] to Surf and I didn't go surf it was
[04:47] raining a bit a bit stormy I think the
[04:49] wavs were flat so I stayed home had a
[04:52] little early breakfast read a book and
[04:54] jump on the stream a little bit
[04:58] earlier
[05:00] what CSS framework are you using to
[05:02] quickly create a UI so fast and I'm
[05:05] using Tailwind CSS plus Daisy UI which
[05:08] is a UI library that have some buil-in
[05:11] components um I don't need I I don't use
[05:15] most of the components but I use the
[05:18] they have colors palett that I use and I
[05:20] just sometimes swap
[05:22] them to you know get the landing page up
[05:25] and running and of course I am using
[05:27] ship fast which is a bot that I created
[05:30] which um has a bunch of premade
[05:32] components maybe I can show you some of
[05:34] them
[05:35] there this is the documentation and you
[05:37] have a bunch of components that come
[05:39] with a ball PL including for instance a
[05:42] pricing section um so what I do is I
[05:44] just clone the ball plate and I deploy
[05:47] the
[05:48] page and I have Shi fast components up
[05:51] and running right here and like you see
[05:54] the pricing session that is right here I
[05:56] can
[05:57] reuse all right
[06:01] is invoice an if frame you can embed or
[06:03] just a link you give it it is a link you
[06:05] give to your customers but you can um if
[06:08] you have let's say a private user
[06:10] dashboard for authenticated users you
[06:12] can add a button that says get invoice
[06:16] and then it's going to open the link and
[06:18] they will be able to selfs serve uh
[06:20] their invoices this is what I'm going to
[06:22] do for ship fast for
[06:24] instance are you the one who designed
[06:26] all of your products unfortunately yes
[06:30] um yeah let me show you real quick uh
[06:34] because yeah this this one I mean Zeno
[06:37] page landing page look better than my
[06:40] very first sing page this is one of the
[06:42] first sing page that I made this is like
[06:44] 5 years old so you can see uh
[06:48] repetition you know iteration over
[06:52] um like doing the same thing over and
[06:54] over at the end you make things better
[06:57] um and so obviously now it's it's quite
[07:00] zoom in now uh it looks better than it
[07:02] was to be but my first landing pages
[07:04] look kind of crapped um this is another
[07:06] product that I built two years
[07:08] ago and you can see there you you see
[07:11] there's a slight progress over
[07:16] it so yeah just keep repeating and and
[07:19] building landing pages helps a lot and
[07:20] also getting inspired by uh people like
[07:23] Danny posma makes beautiful landing
[07:25] pages for Hot Pro uh makeer box from Dan
[07:28] kov or also beautiful landing pages
[07:31] bunch of uh inspiration from the Indie
[07:34] Community okay um yeah so what you see
[07:37] here unscripted I have nothing planned
[07:39] uh the entire startup will be in build
[07:41] is built in public on YouTube so I don't
[07:45] I think live so sometimes I'll be quiet
[07:48] sometimes I'll say some shitty words
[07:50] sometimes I will have stupid ideas um
[07:52] this part of the process there is ABS I
[07:54] I didn't put any thinking in the entire
[07:57] process here the enti thinking goes live
[08:00] um so yeah forgive me for some uh
[08:02] mistakes that I might make uh there is
[08:05] no
[08:06] script all right so we are back to this
[08:10] uh I think we can close that
[08:16] yeah dashboard all right so what we need
[08:19] to do today we will finish the L page um
[08:21] I wrote a full couple things we need to
[08:24] generate terms of
[08:25] services because I think I believe now
[08:32] we have ship fast temps or Services
[08:34] probably yep I need to update
[08:38] that so going back to
[08:48] it we're going to use CH GPT for that it
[08:51] is going to be a simple
[08:58] one
[09:00] let's take this part and copy
[09:08] past hello here's some context the
[09:11] website is Zenvo
[09:14] doio name
[09:17] invoice Mark
[09:24] that's mg that's the description for the
[09:28] startup is is a
[09:30] no code tool for to
[09:35] help
[09:36] generate invoices made on their strip
[09:42] accounts the product the software it's
[09:45] actually a software the software
[09:47] is
[09:48] um
[09:51] one the software access is granted to
[09:54] the
[09:56] user after A1
[10:01] and payment which
[10:05] give which gives
[10:08] customers unlimited access to
[10:12] the
[10:14] product and
[10:17] ownership actually yeah this is the
[10:19] software access I think this should have
[10:20] actually been
[10:25] here should we allow refunds yes we're
[10:27] going to allow refunds just in case is
[10:30] granted to the user after once time
[10:32] payment re customer unlimited access to
[10:34] the
[10:35] product which
[10:38] includes
[10:41] unlimited
[10:44] unlimited tripe accounts
[10:47] connected unlimited invoices they can
[10:51] ask for may we just going to say up to
[10:55] this is a crazy number
[10:58] but just in
[11:03] case and also same for strip account
[11:06] where are they strip account we going to
[11:07] say up to 100 accounts just in case for
[11:11] edge cases this is not very
[11:16] important this user data um we collect
[11:19] the user we don't even collect the
[11:20] username we just collect email and
[11:23] payment information web
[11:27] cookies the Privacy policies right there
[11:31] governing a little
[11:35] Singapore be updated by
[11:39] emails
[11:40] okay give us something
[11:43] chpt and I probably want to say
[11:53] update this is a little reminder for
[11:55] myself or something that have nothing to
[11:58] do with with this
[12:01] app hey Mark yo Kelvin yo man you've
[12:04] been showing
[12:05] up you've been showing up every single
[12:07] day man Nigeria and because I slept
[12:10] early I'm up I'm up to up at 3:00 a.m.
[12:13] buddy wow be working on hack fish
[12:15] alongside with Mark working on Zen voice
[12:17] good luck buddy what are you building
[12:19] bosu yo my boy I was actually talking
[12:22] about headshot Pro a few seconds ago
[12:24] anding that I was inspired by all of
[12:26] your great leing pages man I'm building
[12:30] actually maybe this uh we could have
[12:32] this conversation by message but um I'm
[12:35] wondering if you turn on the option to
[12:36] generate invoices for your customers
[12:39] because the stripe
[12:41] invoicing fee is
[12:43] 4% 0.4% when you generate invoices for
[12:46] onetime purchases which I think is what
[12:48] you use for H
[12:51] Pro um I did turn it on for ship fast
[12:53] for a while and I think I end up
[12:54] spending 1,000 bucks with st just to
[12:57] generate invoices for most customers I'm
[13:00] curious what you do for hot
[13:10] Pro let's copy that little thing here
[13:13] thanks for using the invoice is the
[13:15] policy looks Gooding
[13:19] software 200 account two
[13:24] okay see uh yep but Mr Jud I think you
[13:28] need to write this
[13:43] in
[13:49] see think this is a bit up yep
[13:52] rewrite
[13:54] this without the
[13:57] formatting
[14:05] it is pouring like crazy here in
[14:07] [Music]
[14:13] B oh
[14:31] does it matter no maybe it doesn't
[14:47] matter eight as a
[14:57] scen
[15:00] right there we
[15:06] go this is what we
[15:09] wanted data okay this is not very
[15:13] important when you are shipping stuff
[15:15] stripe requires a term of policy and it
[15:19] takes 2 minutes to generate it with
[15:21] chpt so at least we have a
[15:27] proper a proper proper proper Services
[15:32] okay okay we're going to do same for um
[15:35] I guess a privacy
[15:42] policy
[15:49] that
[15:57] help and reuse a bunch of information
[16:00] there description and there's no
[16:02] ownership
[16:09] here
[16:11] yeah we do not share data with other
[16:13] party Char
[16:20] nope invoice
[16:25] iio please
[16:27] WR
[16:29] add the current
[16:31] okay what cloud provider do you usually
[16:34] use for your different set I guess AWS
[16:37] uh nope I use I use mostly versal I
[16:41] actually use only
[16:44] versal see my apps are
[16:47] here those are all the apps that I've
[16:49] been posting on versal uh I use the API
[16:52] from ver from versal as well so I don't
[16:55] I barely don't have any other services
[16:57] that I use I have a database
[17:00] um I think mongodb Atlas where I have
[17:03] database for each of those projects and
[17:05] if I have some s special like a course
[17:08] being hosted with lots of data I will
[17:11] use AWS for like s S3 or Cloud
[17:27] front blah blah blah the service we
[17:30] collect email payment
[17:33] information
[17:36] okay this is good we have done
[17:41] this all right now we're going to go
[17:43] back to the Ling
[17:44] page and we are going
[17:51] to yes this is the part this is just the
[17:53] Feature Part um I kept thinking about it
[17:56] yesterday we built it but I think there
[17:59] is something missing some context
[18:01] missing it's a bit too thing too
[18:06] simple so I think what I'm going to do
[18:09] is we'll
[18:12] add in future accordion part I will
[18:16] probably add something called
[18:18] [Music]
[18:24] extra and I think we will do something
[18:28] like
[18:32] hero
[18:34] icons say
[18:39] Shield we going to say
[18:42] uh
[18:48] oops secured
[18:50] with
[18:55] stripe and I think we're going to say t
[19:00] SM Bas content
[19:05] secondary and we are going to add this
[19:08] in the items
[19:11] part we have a button index blah blah
[19:14] blah and we have the accordion
[19:16] description and here we want to
[19:18] do uh right maybe we want to do this
[19:24] here if you can hear the music please
[19:27] let me know because I think YouTube will
[19:29] take down the stream if you guys can
[19:32] hear my music for whatever copyright
[19:34] reasons so please let me
[19:38] know and here we going to have
[19:41] extras say that if extra we're going to
[19:44] show the
[19:45] extra and those extra will be
[19:50] there normally now we should have yep we
[19:54] need to rewrite that get a micro one
[20:03] secured with tri restricted API keys I
[20:06] think going to make this one mied
[20:11] accent and there a oh wait we need to
[20:13] format this as a flex Gap to a temp
[20:20] Center and we probably also want to add
[20:24] extra wait
[20:26] actually I should have
[20:30] this on my side window yep just like
[20:34] this normally you should be able to see
[20:36] the code I refresh it is
[20:40] here we want to say oh actually maybe we
[20:44] can make the entire text
[20:56] second yes
[20:59] here if it exists we want to say margin
[21:01] top
[21:02] two
[21:07] three it is secured and here we are
[21:10] going to say it
[21:12] is text
[21:27] S
[21:29] we don't need to do that restri
[21:41] secured right I think that add a little
[21:44] bit of I think I'm going to do these for
[21:47] all maybe we need some more SP spices
[21:50] spices more
[21:53] spices make it spicy um maybe we need
[21:56] some more petting somewhere
[22:19] okay yeah I think we going to do this uh
[22:21] the order where is it y
[22:26] here
[22:36] text it's a bit too small
[22:38] okay secur is resing API
[22:46] Keys no I cannot hear the music okay
[22:48] good good
[22:49] good was that was that for the uh what
[22:52] site is it for the EV SVG images it's
[22:56] called hero icons
[22:58] her icons.com which is from the creators
[23:01] of twin CSS it is an absolute legendary
[23:07] Library uh yep yeah I think we should it
[23:26] one
[23:29] maybe we can say it takes just a few
[23:31] second to
[23:40] add one
[23:44] or GPT give me something add one or
[23:46] multiple STP account to the
[23:48] invoice just take one
[23:56] minute L then
[23:59] a minut no
[24:03] coding no coding required Okay add one
[24:06] or multiple STP accounts to Zenvo it
[24:08] takes less one than a minute okay then
[24:10] we have the other part connect your Zeno
[24:14] get your Zeno
[24:17] link so here we uh we want to do a few
[24:20] things
[24:25] here in the extra category we're going
[24:28] to
[24:34] say
[24:35] [Music]
[24:42] email just
[24:46] mail let me use this
[24:51] one send by
[24:55] email or a account account maybe user
[24:58] yeah there we
[25:01] go where is it come
[25:05] back send by email
[25:14] or show on user
[25:18] dashboard so here yes we have
[25:21] something we are going Marin but some
[25:25] one two
[25:41] say this is too long your customers can
[25:43] retrieve any successful payments on all
[25:45] your s
[25:50] accounts wait we can remove a bunch of
[25:52] stuff
[25:56] here
[26:04] think need to
[26:17] this5 right I'm doing something not
[26:20] super
[26:26] good
[26:31] is y
[26:36] 1.5
[26:41] okay we probably want to reduce a little
[26:44] bit the size of that
[26:45] thing uh we have two columns maybe we do
[26:49] something like
[26:51] this yes why
[26:54] not but maybe we want to make the
[26:57] description a little
[27:01] smaller x with SM
[27:08] maybe okay I'm going to leave
[27:14] it secured with strip res API keys by
[27:18] email show on
[27:26] dashboard
[27:28] okay and here this part we want to say I
[27:31] think three S three things
[27:56] um
[28:05] we want to say a few things we want to
[28:08] say
[28:11] um the extra part we're going to
[28:19] say here yeah it is here we want to have
[28:24] the shield icon and say secured with
[28:29] one
[28:42] with I need to write the description for
[28:45] this to explain
[28:48] that um what is the name of
[28:51] it people can only retrieve their
[28:53] invoices if they confirm their address
[28:55] email email address
[28:58] I want to say a really short sentence
[28:59] that say secured with magic links
[29:02] or or maybe
[29:05] data
[29:09] protected with magic links that's too
[29:13] big and maybe if someone
[29:18] is feeling
[29:20] inspired I want to mention so I what I
[29:23] want to mention here is that once I send
[29:26] the link to
[29:29] customer see
[29:32] here if um there is a purchase that's
[29:36] made under the customer's name they
[29:38] won't be able to see anything so
[29:40] customers won't be able to see other
[29:42] customers data they will only be able to
[29:45] see their own data and for that they
[29:47] once they we retrieve a payment they
[29:50] will receive an email that says click
[29:53] this um private link or whatever there's
[29:55] a token that is is sent to the email of
[29:58] the person so that that person can only
[30:00] view their invoices once they click the
[30:02] email so we don't leak customer data and
[30:05] I kind of want to highlight that in a
[30:07] one sentence
[30:08] [Music]
[30:10] thing just don't know how to do
[30:14] that customer generate their invoice so
[30:16] once a customer find a successful
[30:17] payment they receive a secure link to
[30:19] generate
[30:21] edit So Pro maybe we're just going to
[30:23] say protected data protected
[30:26] data
[30:29] or
[30:32] data I'm going to say protected data um
[30:36] and I want maybe to say
[30:39] it's uh
[30:43] Europe
[30:47] low
[30:49] Justice
[30:52] wait um lawyer no scale maybe oh yeah
[30:57] yeah there we go and we kind of want to
[30:59] say here that it
[31:03] is
[31:04] compliance
[31:09] invoice formats
[31:13] maybe I don't know that makes sense
[31:15] compliant invoice
[31:20] format invoice under
[31:24] GST invoice template
[31:28] compliant maybe compliant invoice
[31:35] template they can also editable and also
[31:39] editable
[31:41] um here we must say
[31:56] it's
[31:57] we can say Euro compliance
[32:03] template editable
[32:05] invoices and we want to say probably
[32:10] little pen here to do the
[32:16] work so what we get here
[32:18] editable once a customer F mon they can
[32:21] they receive a secure link secure link
[32:24] to generate edit and download invoices
[32:32] all right I think that should be
[32:35] enough did I make any typ of my poor
[32:39] French
[32:42] language I need to double check
[32:44] everything that I write in
[32:50] English that should be good no yep that
[32:56] okay
[32:57] when telling your when selling your
[32:59] product on stripe do you have to share
[33:01] your address with
[33:03] customers
[33:05] um it depends um you don't you don't
[33:08] have technically you don't have to but
[33:11] based on where the customers are some of
[33:13] them I request that you
[33:15] do um usually Europeans have more strict
[33:20] invoicing
[33:21] templates and so they will require you
[33:24] to add your business uh this happens to
[33:26] me every week where I need to have my
[33:29] business um address added to the
[33:37] invoice let's get back to
[33:40] so connect strip accounts add one or
[33:43] multiple stripe accounts to your invoice
[33:45] it takes Les minutes no coding required
[33:47] secur
[33:52] TP your customers can retrieve any
[33:54] successful payments on all their on all
[33:56] your
[34:03] any successful payments made on can
[34:07] retrieve any successful payments made on
[34:09] any and all your STP account made on all
[34:13] your sh
[34:21] accounts successful pment they receive a
[34:23] secure link to generate edit and
[34:24] download invoices they can
[34:27] you can
[34:48] also the8
[34:50] number that
[34:53] company here we can say uh company
[34:56] details okay okay yeah that makes sense
[34:57] fix typo Etc protected data editable
[35:01] invoices Euro compliance
[35:05] template should we settle with this
[35:08] hello Mark F we're here final touches
[35:11] here we go Brian yeah man last day of
[35:13] coding tomorrow marketing strikes
[35:18] again I think this is a bit better um
[35:21] there is a part that I want to update in
[35:25] the fiq I think one
[35:30] question would be
[35:34] why why do I need Z
[35:42] invoice so to approach here either
[35:46] people pay for stripe invoicing so I
[35:49] need to talk about the fee or you don't
[35:51] pay for stripe invoices and you have to
[35:53] manually generate those
[35:55] invoices
[35:59] so maybe I will add a stripe invoicing
[36:02] fee because some people might not even
[36:04] know they pay for the stripe fee so
[36:07] might want to add a link
[36:10] say
[36:14] one those fee applies on
[36:24] to when you
[36:43] charge one
[36:45] time one time payments when you when you
[36:49] sell One Time payments
[36:51] products One Time payments products on
[36:55] stripe
[36:57] stri
[37:05] charge
[37:08] two
[37:13] $2 I think I want to
[37:15] say
[37:18] here I need to add the link so people
[37:22] have a little proof of what I'm talking
[37:25] about
[37:27] class and we're going to make it a link
[37:29] link
[37:31] access and Target equal H uh
[37:36] blank stri takes a 0.4
[37:40] cut so that is one thing we want people
[37:44] to
[37:49] know Z
[37:55] voice see
[38:05] with
[38:07] Zen
[38:10] you only a once and never
[38:16] again and never
[38:22] again right so that's the first part the
[38:24] second part is
[38:30] if you
[38:33] don't if you don't generate if you don't
[38:37] what is it you
[38:39] don't pass uh if you don't
[38:42] generate invoices for your custom wait
[38:46] no if you don't pay for if you don't pay
[38:49] for
[38:51] stripe
[38:54] invoicing you will
[39:00] get customer
[39:09] request asking for
[39:12] invoices
[39:16] receipts stripe receipts are not
[39:25] AR
[39:28] enough
[39:30] for
[39:36] most
[39:40] regulations and
[39:42] if and if you don't and if you don't
[39:45] want to pay for stripe invoicing you
[39:46] will get customer
[39:48] request you you'll get customer request
[39:50] asking for invoices stripe receipts
[39:53] aren't enough for most countries
[39:54] regulation and finally
[39:59] finally stripe
[40:11] invoices
[40:13] editable your
[40:22] customers
[40:23] and and there
[40:32] bat X
[40:34] ID of Big T
[40:37] close after the purchase
[40:41] is
[40:44] done and of course we're going to say
[40:49] Zenvo
[40:51] fixes all
[40:53] that hey that is some serious confidence
[40:57] copyrighting right
[41:00] here I think the colors are off
[41:05] though not
[41:08] bad what do I need to
[41:13] invoice where didate try Pi
[41:19] a most countryes
[41:25] regulations
[41:30] our fix typos oh okay I didn't know typo
[41:32] could be
[41:34] plural after P done
[41:42] okay where are you doing marketing when
[41:44] you finish where
[41:47] you where are you doing marketing when
[41:49] you finish up the sess um where am I
[41:52] doing
[41:53] marketing I am going to the marketing on
[41:56] I'm going to launch on product I'm going
[41:57] to make a little video for that I'm
[42:00] going to launch on um probably
[42:02] communities like hiker
[42:05] news yeah I can news for sure um I'll
[42:08] see some subreddits maybe some stripe
[42:10] related subreddits and some
[42:12] entrepreneurs related
[42:14] subreddit which I will also have to make
[42:16] a video for that I will launch on
[42:18] Twitter where I have now a little
[42:20] audience of people who might have the
[42:22] same issue as me I'll see if there's
[42:24] some SEO to be done I don't think
[42:26] there's anything
[42:28] to that could work for us but I'll give
[42:30] it a little
[42:33] try I think that'll be all um it is a
[42:36] product where I have no I don't have
[42:38] much ambition this is mostly a fix for
[42:40] me because I really need that thing
[42:43] every
[42:44] day
[42:45] so I won't push too I won't be too you
[42:49] know doing too much marketing I'll see
[42:51] if there is a feat maybe some you know
[42:53] maybe not everyone needs the product I
[42:55] don't know
[42:56] I'll see where how the market reacts so
[42:58] I'm launching and I assess and see if
[43:02] there is a good conversion rate on the
[43:03] website if that's the case maybe it's
[43:05] worth thinking more it's not the case
[43:07] maybe it's better to just move on and
[43:08] just you know keep using the product
[43:10] benefits from soling my own
[43:13] problems and
[43:25] here
[43:39] oh see how it works um so why do I need
[43:42] invoice when you sell onetime payments
[43:44] products stripe takes a 0.4%
[43:48] cut
[43:50] per
[43:55] B
[43:56] when you
[43:59] charge same payments products charge per
[44:06] sale invoice you only pay once and never
[44:08] again and if you don't pay for strap
[44:11] invoicing you will get customer request
[44:13] asking for invoices Tri receipts aren't
[44:15] enough for most countes regulations only
[44:17] stri invoices aren't editable your
[44:19] customers can't add the tax ID or fix
[44:22] tles after the purchase is done voice
[44:25] fix that do I have have to use stripe
[44:27] yes sir does it work for one time
[44:29] purchases yes it's made for one time
[44:31] purchases to avoid paying the 0.2% fee
[44:34] does it work if I don't use stripe
[44:36] invoices yes cost okay does it work for
[44:41] past transactions it does the invoice
[44:43] will check for successful payments on
[44:45] your stripe account accounts on your
[44:50] stripe
[44:52] accounts and generates invoices for any
[45:00] successful is it secure yes we use
[45:02] restricted API keys to access your strap
[45:04] account using the minimum record data to
[45:06] generate
[45:08] invoices can customers see others
[45:10] invoice customers can only view edit and
[45:12] don't know their own invoices if your
[45:14] customers retrieve a payment they will
[45:15] have to config their email address to
[45:17] access the payment
[45:21] data okay that makes a little bit more
[45:24] sense and don't have a business address
[45:27] should I have or use my home address
[45:31] right
[45:33] um okay so I'm going to assume that you
[45:36] you might be using stripe without having
[45:38] a underlying
[45:40] business in that case I
[45:43] think
[45:50] um no I wouldn't uh I wouldn't show your
[45:53] personal address on your stripe invoice
[45:58] is I think I mean the the solution here
[46:00] for you is to open a business uh if you
[46:03] don't have one and you're just getting
[46:04] started and you make $100 online at the
[46:06] very
[46:08] beginning I've been there I've been
[46:09] doing it for a few months and I think
[46:13] it's okay to do that so don't show your
[46:16] email but I would open a little business
[46:18] as fast as you can so you
[46:21] are um you know in regulation with your
[46:25] uh cont know and you know I think the
[46:27] worst thing that can happen is having
[46:29] your your country uh IRS knock the door
[46:32] and say hey you you shouldn't be doing
[46:35] that you own us a little bit of money I
[46:36] think for me at least that's the most
[46:37] important part is to have an entire
[46:40] Freedom where no one can knock my knock
[46:42] my door and tell me you owe you owe me
[46:43] taxes so I would I would open a proper
[46:46] business and and add that business
[46:49] address to the
[46:53] invoice you are missing a word in the
[46:55] first you question should say something
[46:57] like when you charge
[46:59] okay why do we need when you oh good
[47:03] point good catch man thank you when you
[47:08] sell one time payment product thanks man
[47:13] we have the
[47:17] fq the pricing stop wasting how is
[47:20] maging stripe invoices dital stripe
[47:22] invoice fee reduce customer support and
[47:23] focus on your startup I think we have
[47:28] maybe the launch discount could
[47:34] be maybe we can do
[47:38] animate also
[47:45] something this is very tiny but just to
[47:47] show that it's temporary that's very
[47:51] tiny one time payment then need Ser
[47:54] forever
[47:57] oh yeah here I might want to add support
[48:00] okay
[48:02] login pricing working Affiliates
[48:07] okay um I think I might be reusing
[48:12] whatever barel maybe or did they do that
[48:17] nope maybe buy
[48:22] dispute yes okay I think I'm going to be
[48:24] reusing by disputes this is
[48:27] cute and I think I should be using that
[48:30] so going to go in by
[48:33] dispute making sure I don't have my AP
[48:35] Keys being
[48:40] shown I think this is the part
[48:46] more the footer so yeah usually what I
[48:49] do this is not you know a big marketing
[48:51] thing but I have a few products running
[48:56] so you can see
[48:57] here for instance bu dispute would get
[48:59] 130 visitors per
[49:01] day so what I do is I try to always have
[49:06] Links at the bottom of my lending
[49:09] Pages where um I cross promote my
[49:13] startups I this is a link to my
[49:15] newsletter these are the links to other
[49:18] little startups it boost
[49:21] SEO and also you know you can get do
[49:26] traffic here and
[49:28] there
[49:33] lngs more newsl from maker Indie page
[49:36] ship fast and we want to say
[49:41] maybe those
[49:54] PES
[50:03] and yeah I probably want to add my
[50:04] little face there to add some kind
[50:08] of wouldn't say trust cuz would he would
[50:12] be have to be crazy to tr this french
[50:13] guy but I I can tell a little
[50:19] story there
[50:24] um to add Mark oh I need to copy past my
[50:28] face then
[50:30] somewhere
[50:33] um I'm going to go to buy
[50:35] dispute and we have I think it's in
[50:39] folder
[50:40] probably yeah I'm going to duplicate
[50:44] that and we are going to test my stupid
[50:48] face right there okay and so now we have
[50:52] haers a mark my Twitter link
[50:56] uh you can follow my work on twit yeah
[50:58] okay my IND page link and my Twitter
[51:00] link we have by
[51:03] disput ship fast Indie page and my
[51:09] newsletter the footer oops close
[51:12] the wrong
[51:18] window's skip back to
[51:21] it see one more
[51:24] time
[51:27] oh I need to fix whatever is going
[51:29] on here with the
[51:34] footer did I do that for by
[51:43] disputes maybe with maybe this where
[51:46] part is
[51:54] difference
[52:04] oh yeah it's probably this part we want
[52:06] to
[52:07] copy let's see how that goes okay we
[52:09] have a little bit more
[52:12] space just ugly here doesn't
[52:16] matter um large device we have this okay
[52:20] hey C I'm Mark I'm the creator of
[52:21] invoice you can follow my work on
[52:24] Twitter okay that's good enough we have
[52:26] the
[52:27] fq
[52:29] the
[52:31] racing
[52:34] maybe should we do something like this
[52:38] and power
[52:54] glass
[52:56] I launch discount
[52:59] um okay SEC it's secured sendil show on
[53:20] dashboard wasting how is managing stripe
[53:22] invoices digital stripe invoice or
[53:24] customer support and focus on your
[53:25] startup okay this is a
[53:28] clear a new
[53:37] proposition how do you permanent
[53:39] permanently live in b as a French bro uh
[53:42] because I am soon to be not French
[53:45] anymore u i mean I'm I'm going to be
[53:48] French but I'm not going to be a French
[53:49] tax resident so oh man that's a boring
[53:52] part I was going through last year
[53:54] basically
[53:55] where you live more than 6 months per
[53:57] year is the country you're supposed to
[53:59] be a tax resident so it doesn't matter
[54:02] where your nationality is except from
[54:05] USA American people it's different story
[54:08] I think Canadian as well but as a
[54:11] European uh wherever you live in the
[54:13] world for more than 6 months is supposed
[54:15] to be the place where you pay taxes um I
[54:18] spend more than 6 months a year here in
[54:19] belly so I'm supposed to pay taxes here
[54:21] in
[54:22] Bell and that would be pretty much the
[54:24] same for every
[54:33] country inves L your customer generate
[54:35] and invoices so you don't have to
[54:37] generate and generate edit oh okay maybe
[54:42] in the hereo section let here customers
[54:49] generate edit and download their stripe
[54:51] invoices so you don't have
[54:53] to no stripe invoice oh maybe we didn't
[54:56] say just no stripe invoice
[54:59] CV not good setup reduce customer
[55:06] support by
[55:08] stripe it's invoice okay of managing Str
[55:14] invoices create
[55:24] invoice
[55:32] certain 1 payments for unlimited
[55:33] invoices no more customer support
[55:37] editable invoices to stay
[55:41] compliant I think we have something a
[55:43] little bit
[55:45] better
[55:47] yiggy wish is say biggy uh no
[55:54] biggie
[56:02] [Music]

[60:39] to make
[60:42] friends kind of proud of that one and
[60:46] import

[60:57] Nico is a
[60:59] p
[61:01] bang I've never call him that way Bok G
[61:06] there
[61:09] Bing and we are going to import mark

[61:22] done EO
[61:34] Mark
[61:42] Mark okay Nico was a PNG oh Nico was a
[61:45] JPEG
[61:46] okay such a
[61:51] JPEG then Nico and Mark here perfect
[62:01] here we don't have a source
[62:10] yet okay we probably have to change that
[62:13] later so I
[62:23] think
[62:25] all legit
[62:37] okay all right
[62:41] um 32 oh yeah we need to oh yeah yeah we
[62:44] need to do that of course cuz right now
[62:46] we don't
[62:49] have
[62:51] we we are actually not fetching
[62:54] we need to add this thing
[63:00] here because we want to revalidate this
[63:03] page every hours here we're going to say
[63:12] Zeno stripe subscriptions stripe
[63:15] invoices
[63:16] without the
[63:20] fee now I think we're going to reuse
[63:22] Focus install up not the invoices
[63:26] wait actually let's see if there
[63:30] is keyword
[63:32] um right invoice let's see what we get
[63:40] here stripe invoice
[63:43] scam this is a good keyword I receive an
[63:46] email from stripe oh okay no no
[63:53] no oh okay no no that's a different scam
[63:56] using strap invoice just don't pay bills
[63:58] for people you don't know online you
[64:01] won't have any trouble Captain Obvious
[64:04] thank you man okay
[64:08] now actually there a bunch of little
[64:10] keywords probably most of them are
[64:12] branded under stripe so it will be
[64:15] impossible to rank send stripe invoice
[64:18] let's see what they got here yeah stripe
[64:20] will be on the first page oh we have
[64:22] YouTube how to say invoices for
[64:26] beginners interesting user adaption so
[64:30] smooth you have magical powers oh if I
[64:33] do that I'll get banned from oh yeah the
[64:36] stream will be taken down okay okay okay
[64:37] I cannot watch YouTube
[64:40] videos let's see we're still live I
[64:43] think I've been doing this
[64:46] once and I think I got wait to be
[64:49] careful when I go on YouTube when you
[64:51] live stream otherwise you might get
[64:53] banned
[64:55] yeah I go directly on my channel to make
[64:56] sure I don't it
[65:00] up we're still live on YouTube
[65:03] so okay no YouTube for now I cannot
[65:06] procrastinate okay typ invo status STP
[65:10] invoice reminders okay that is a invoice
[65:13] templates yeah that could be an
[65:15] interesting
[65:23] keyword
[65:25] invoice example with a stripe
[65:28] dashboard maybe the stripe invoice
[65:30] keyword could be interesting
[65:35] um maybe the tired of managing stripe
[65:41] invoices may we can do
[65:45] this managing strip
[65:50] invoices um let your customers edit so
[65:53] you don't have have to that is
[65:56] good invoice is a no code
[66:04] solution and not to reduce C save money
[66:07] on stength fees okay viers we don't need
[66:11] any relative okay open
[66:14] graph oh that could be
[66:17] interesting managing Str noices and
[66:20] here kind of want to do that
[66:26] right so we have our SEO tags and here
[66:28] we will need to
[66:30] do
[66:33] uh is it no I think it is not how it
[66:37] works no oh yeah okay I mean yeah I'm
[66:41] using another version of next in my head
[66:46] so we need to connect to the database
[66:50] first
[66:53] import
[66:56] and import
[66:57] user and here we're going to do
[66:59] something like
[67:01] um assign
[67:03] function and here we're going to do oh
[67:06] yeah we also need that
[67:08] Library let's go to
[67:11] here
[67:13] okay is it working no it's not in
[67:19] that leavs
[67:22] SEO where is it
[67:28] here we
[67:30] nope this all right ter of managing
[67:33] stripe invoices okay
[67:47] um okay little idea yeah
[67:51] annoying invoice or refil
[68:04] and here we want to say uh constant
[68:08] user users total we going to say count
[68:13] documents and because it's a we charge
[68:16] before user create their accounts so
[68:19] there will be as many users as they are
[68:21] customers so it is safe to do this
[68:24] and we can send this to the hero
[68:28] section from the hero we can receive it
[68:32] and pass it to
[68:36] the testimonial
[68:38] avatars
[68:42] here and the testimonal Avatar section
[68:45] we can receive that little
[68:48] part and
[68:52] say uh
[68:54] where is it yep here we can say
[68:57] this five solo prur sleep better and we
[69:02] have the number that will be updated
[69:03] every hour so it is transparent it's
[69:06] relevant and it's
[69:09] legit right now it's time
[69:12] to add some testimonials to the landing
[69:15] page
[69:22] uh
[69:24] I
[69:36] think I think it makes sense to reuse a
[69:40] small spread a few components like
[69:46] this a little bit everywhere in the
[69:52] app
[70:06] what do we do for ship Fest how that
[70:08] looks we testimonials like this yeah
[70:12] this is exactly the same
[70:16] thing I think we can reuse the same
[70:20] template testimonial name and maybe
[70:23] Twitter followers at the bottom to add
[70:25] some social
[70:26] proof that sounds good
[70:52] um
[71:13] you think right now we okay we'll
[71:15] probably have a few testimonials I think
[71:17] the this section shouldn't be touched
[71:20] tired of managing stripe invoices should
[71:24] we add something No Maybe not maybe we
[71:26] should add a testimonial at the bottom
[71:29] of this
[71:31] page yeah probably we want to add a a
[71:34] user testimonal here and probably
[71:36] another one under the pricing
[71:39] section and probably a big call to
[71:42] action at the bottom okay let's get
[71:45] coding features
[71:52] cordion
[71:57] maybe we can import Nico first or then
[72:01] no we going to import then cuz I
[72:16] think I need to send that video to then
[72:22] must
[72:37] right then you are live on the YouTube
[72:40] video and as you can see I am uh adding
[72:43] your testimonial and this is your name
[72:45] in my
[72:47] code I hope you I hope you enjoy the
[72:50] file
[72:52] name
[72:56] then is nothing here to make friends
[72:58] image okay so this will probably
[73:04] be there's accordion probably be
[73:07] underneath that
[73:10] part and we are going to
[73:13] browse where did I put that somewhere
[73:16] here pricing testimonial
[73:20] three where is it I'm going to just copy
[73:22] pass the code that I have have already
[73:23] for Ryan
[73:32] Huber
[73:34] Hoover features listic calls and I am
[73:37] going to copy
[73:40] past a piece of
[73:52] code
[74:00] then
[74:02] kov feedback
[74:05] for Zen
[74:21] voice right we have done here that
[74:27] says should make that a little
[74:31] bigger right we get the testimonial from
[74:34] them that says I don't want to
[74:37] pay
[74:40] okay why isn't something like bu like
[74:43] already this will be a
[74:52] div
[75:02] and this will be another line
[75:07] up and a
[75:15] bus and I don't spend 10 minutes man
[75:18] catching invoices either inv voice solve
[75:20] this problem once and for all they happy
[75:22] simple but but it Nails the job
[75:26] perfectly okay um I think because it's a
[75:29] bigger testal we are going to probably
[75:31] make this a little bit
[75:32] smaller space yeah y
[75:38] two
[75:40] okay um you are not Ryan you are Dan
[75:51] kov probably we want to
[76:01] do on semi bold and maybe
[76:12] another where are we Mr
[76:18] Den 23k maybe 24
[76:22] 23.1 maybe
[76:34] 23.1k X and
[76:37] text
[76:39] content
[76:52] secondary
[76:54] okay we might want to add a little bit
[76:55] more spacing here maybe six and
[77:02] eight we probably don't need to do
[77:07] that and we might want to say the max
[77:11] width to be
[77:13] MD SM
[77:22] Maybe
[77:33] okay the text is too
[77:46] big this is also a little bit too
[77:52] big
[77:59] pretty
[78:00] good should
[78:07] four what else do we have to
[78:20] do okay
[78:34] okay should we highlight that
[78:39] part I don't want to spend 10
[78:42] minutes
[78:44] really it is a good testimonial so it's
[78:46] very hard to know which part we should
[78:48] or should not highlight maybe I'll just
[78:50] leave it the way it
[78:51] is
[78:54] and just
[78:56] add probably a little bit of margin at
[79:00] the
[79:12] top the leading
[79:16] part that's
[79:21] good
[79:25] we can say this I don't want
[79:27] to right for every invoices sometimes
[79:30] when testimonal are a little bit
[79:32] long not very long but longer than just
[79:35] one sentence you might want to highlight
[79:37] a sentence or
[79:41] two I'm trying something
[79:51] uh
[79:56] I don't want to pay $2 to sty for every
[79:59] invoice so I don't want to spend 10
[80:01] minutes either CR okay all right I think
[80:04] we get something
[80:17] here right first testimonial
[80:21] Luke
[80:31] [Music]
[80:44] [Music]
[80:51] good
[81:08] toay I don't want to spend 10
[81:18] minutes factoring
[81:21] uiu leave
[81:26] the to the
[81:34] [Music]
[81:41] [Music]
[81:51] point
[81:55] [Music]
[82:21] line
[82:31] [Music]
[82:32] maybe so I will probably
[82:36] DOA
[82:39] this and next item Center
[82:51] justify
[83:00] justify
[83:04] Center okay and we will probably do ch
[83:08] ch ch
[83:10] up instead of having this I'm going to
[83:13] re this
[83:15] testimonial avatars
[83:20] array yep I'm going to do that
[83:23] and I am going to change this part here
[83:25] for
[83:26] that let
[83:29] say
[83:31] justify it's a flex right inine Flex
[83:35] just oh maybe I should I have to make it
[83:37] a flex
[83:42] then is it working color is a bit off
[83:48] though oh actually oh maybe okay okay
[83:52] okay okay I know what I'm going to do
[83:53] I'm going to
[83:55] do here I'm just going to do text uh BG
[84:01] yellow which is going to highlight this
[84:03] part of a testimonial and we going to
[84:06] make it maybe
[84:08] 100 that too much maybe it's said a bit
[84:11] too much I don't
[84:21] know
[84:26] right I feel like this is a decent
[84:30] testimonial five stars I don't want to
[84:33] pay
[84:39] no
[84:42] okay hey Mark I'm thinking about
[84:44] building a product that helps folks like
[84:46] you translate their product uh do you
[84:48] think that could be valuable for
[84:51] you
[84:57] it is a good question I it doesn't come
[84:59] to mine I could have tried to do it for
[85:01] some of my products and I didn't for
[85:03] some
[85:13] reasons I know I think it's I kind of
[85:16] need to see how that goes you know if
[85:17] it's like one click thing for versal
[85:21] maybe
[85:23] I think if it's some like of
[85:25] internationalization
[85:27] thing not sure not sure curious to see
[85:30] how you make it
[85:32] work all right we have Dan testimonal
[85:34] here now we need to
[85:37] make nio testimonial somewhere
[85:41] else for customers okay okay okay I
[85:45] think yeah we're going to make nicoo
[85:46] under the pricing
[85:48] session import
[85:51] ni image
[85:54] from and we called him Bangkok boy I can
[85:59] make fun of them here on the live stream
[86:01] because I know they will probably not
[86:04] join Nico will be Bok
[86:08] uh and I'm stupidly proud of this joke
[86:13] wow um we are going to make image and
[86:17] here we're going to see
[86:19] niik niik Janette
[86:23] ni see feedback for
[86:28] invoice
[86:30] image and we need to import the image
[86:40] part okay so we should have niik here
[86:44] and we will just
[86:46] change uh the right testimonial he said
[86:49] not having many not having many manually
[86:53] okay I need to fix the typo actually Le
[86:56] is a good proof it's a real testimonial
[86:57] not having manually to create not having
[87:01] to to make invoices manually is saving
[87:04] me tons of support work now I can just
[87:07] send the link to customers and they
[87:08] handle everything
[87:12] themselves
[87:15] okay um h ni we going to put you
[87:20] here and we are going to copy that
[87:24] little part
[87:32] there saving mums of support work right
[87:35] that's the part we want to
[87:38] highlight now I
[87:47] just is maybe we should just break this
[87:50] in two sentences
[87:53] um
[87:57] BR that
[88:01] looks how does it look Mr niik maybe
[88:05] it's too big no maybe actually was good
[88:07] he said one
[88:21] sentence
[88:42] right yeah Nico is not done I to make
[88:46] sure we fix
[88:48] that what is his name this guy is
[88:51] supposed to to be my friend and I don't
[88:53] even know his name is it Jan
[88:57] Janette or
[88:59] John we should fix Nico once and for all
[89:02] Nico just niik
[89:04] okay D
[89:06] it I think we should vote for these guys
[89:08] to entirely
[89:11] rename his Twitter
[89:15] name 21.7 B
[89:20] go
[89:24] not having to make invoices manually see

[89:35] is
[89:42] working what do we have here so we
[89:46] have close close close close landing

[90:14] support work now I can just send the
[90:15] link to customers and they handle
[90:16] everything themselves
[90:18] good
[90:20] um maybe we want to have a little C to
[90:23] action somewhere there under the fq and
[90:27] so yes I can reuse a ship F component
[90:30] that is
[90:31] good I think yeah I think I'll need to
[90:34] import the button check
[90:50] out and we go also going to import the
[90:52] config file oh the config file is right
[90:55] here we have a buy
