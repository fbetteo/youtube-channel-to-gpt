[01:39] yo
[01:49] here we go all the life here we go
[01:58] um
[02:23] perfect
[02:38] my leg is there
[02:41] looks cute
[02:47] I'm sorry okay
[03:02] I need to pop out the chats
[03:22] [Music]
[03:29] okay
[03:35] hello Twitter friends
[03:37] hello YouTube Friends
[03:39] happy Sunday
[03:42] yep we're live all good happy Sunday
[03:46] happy Saturday probably for the rest of
[03:49] the world hello
[03:52] where we are so yesterday
[03:55] um we submitted the app for the first
[03:57] time ever on the App Store and on the
[04:01] Google Play Store
[04:03] it's Saturday so obviously we are going
[04:05] to be in review for both I guess
[04:09] I'll just double check
[04:18] whenever you want Apple
[04:24] this is a joke okay waiting for review
[04:26] okay
[04:28] yeah the app has been submitted we're in
[04:30] day five so we have three more days to
[04:31] launch uh we have a day that's going to
[04:34] be about marketing and making the video
[04:38] for product tents
[04:40] which is going to be the last thing and
[04:43] so we have a day or two to finish the
[04:44] app because now it's um there are a few
[04:47] things that could be improved
[04:48] uh trying to take notes in here so this
[04:51] is done the monetization
[04:55] um let's drag me through
[04:58] and this is done too actually we're
[05:00] actually we can close all that so maybe
[05:02] on today's goals
[05:07] uh yeah Google login is a bit boring but
[05:10] it has to be done because it's a it's an
[05:12] app for pretty much everyone and I feel
[05:14] like social logins are important
[05:17] um I don't know probably we won't do
[05:19] this
[05:20] uh this is important
[05:22] and also the landing page we have uh we
[05:25] have a landing page that doesn't exist
[05:28] right now if you go to the hero feeds it
[05:30] looks like this
[05:32] um and you can use the app here
[05:35] the americanism key but basically yeah
[05:37] that's the app it's uh somehow working
[05:39] you can complete uh you have
[05:41] leaderboards
[05:44] you have a payment system I think
[05:49] yeah the payment is here it goes on
[05:52] stripe if you're on the web and if you
[05:54] are on mobile you can have payment with
[05:57] the native store payments
[06:03] um what else
[06:06] to login
[06:08] maybe you're gonna put
[06:09] this first
[06:15] no message when level up landing page
[06:19] amazing
[06:25] stuff like potatoes and stuff
[06:31] great I don't know how much we can
[06:33] complete but let's go on I mean Korea
[06:36] wow my wife is Korean are you are you
[06:39] Korean yourself
[06:43] exactly to see what happened hey
[06:46] part two yeah but uh if you got the
[06:48] summary part two was just uh submitting
[06:50] the app on the stores
[06:52] we're live on uh on oh we're we're we
[06:55] submitted the app on IOS and Android and
[06:57] we're waiting for the review and while
[06:59] we're waiting for the review I'm gonna
[07:00] add a few stuff to the app
[07:03] yeah my wife is Korean
[07:05] yeah yeah look
[07:08] what's up yo Yan
[07:12] that's my wife
[07:15] are you Korean
[07:30] language
[07:38] foreign
[08:01] [Music]
[08:18] it's a good it's a good weekend
[08:20] um
[08:22] yeah we can I think we can go on so
[08:26] we're gonna start the dev and
[08:30] as a quick recap
[08:36] uh localhost
[08:39] so lending page has to be worked on so
[08:42] if I sign up in here I have the base six
[08:45] whatever
[08:50] um so the app is pretty
[08:52] blank for now um you can add your avatar
[08:56] I'm going to snowboard
[08:58] I'm going to say that we're going to do
[09:00] it five times a week
[09:03] and I think so users will do that and I
[09:07] think here we somehow need to have a
[09:13] If I complete my workout for today
[09:17] a lot of things happen I level up 2 and
[09:20] I gain 20 XP
[09:24] but maybe if it's the first time you
[09:26] sign up you do this you don't really
[09:28] understand what's going on and then
[09:30] there's nothing else you can actually do
[09:31] in the app so maybe I'll make the level
[09:33] up process a bit
[09:35] uh
[09:37] difference or
[09:42] let me think
[09:49] yeah because it's pretty blunt
[10:00] all right I think we need that
[10:01] [Music]
[10:02] um
[10:06] delete or edit
[10:08] workout Avatar
[10:11] because now you can create one and you
[10:13] cannot delete it or you can edit it so
[10:15] if you make a mistake then the app will
[10:17] tell you oh you want more avatars you
[10:18] have to pay which is not really friendly
[10:20] delete workout
[10:23] oh maybe yeah if it did like your goal
[10:26] and stuff
[10:34] what else
[10:45] complete
[10:52] it's gonna be on mobile so the design
[10:54] doesn't really matter
[10:56] but
[10:58] I know if you guys are watching this um
[11:04] I'm trying to you know make it a bit
[11:06] more friendly for people who sign up for
[11:07] the first time
[11:09] um
[11:10] here it's all green because it's I own
[11:12] this character
[11:14] but later on only yours will be green
[11:17] and the others will be black so you you
[11:19] see how you rank versus others
[11:22] uh
[11:27] and I feel like we could add a little
[11:29] something that makes
[11:31] this simpler
[11:57] oh sweet tomato first
[12:00] okay Korean thank you drew
[12:03] first one today oh wow
[12:06] hey yeah that's awesome man that's so
[12:08] good I think yeah the first one is the
[12:10] most important what are you what are you
[12:11] working on
[12:13] the front end I need to learn about can
[12:15] uh side I'm using next JS API
[12:20] this thing somewhere
[12:24] yep this just a folder here I can add
[12:28] routes API routes and the execute
[12:30] serverless
[12:35] okay go let's check it out
[12:39] I mean it's still good like uh even
[12:41] though if it's just Evolution it's still
[12:43] I think the first online dollars are the
[12:45] one that leaks and you realize ah okay I
[12:48] can do something on the Internet
[12:58] ah thank you
[13:06] let me just
[13:10] oh down too
[13:23] it's it's [ __ ] awesome
[13:37] man plug my new uh add your Twitter if
[13:41] people love your design they might want
[13:42] to follow this journey it's so nice man
[13:46] yeah man all right so good
[13:49] genius
[13:57] yeah oh man that's so cool I love that
[14:00] level four
[14:04] that's important Avatar
[14:08] played it ah nice
[14:13] your hero
[14:16] man you're a genius I love it
[14:18] I really love it okay uh so
[14:22] there are a few things I won't be able
[14:24] to do so the color stuff I'll keep my
[14:25] colors just because uh you know it's
[14:28] like we have a schedule to launch in
[14:30] seven days I'm going to change
[14:32] everything else pretty much
[14:36] um
[14:37] um let's see
[14:42] yeah so cool
[14:45] um
[14:45] I love this part of having different
[14:47] colors based on the workouts uh
[14:53] no no man I mean it's just so cool I
[14:55] think it's really good I'm actually
[14:56] looking to make the app a little bit
[14:57] easier
[14:59] so your design is just it it's here at
[15:02] the perfect time I love it
[15:05] um
[15:08] I think the card makes a lot of sense
[15:10] the color makes a lot of sense
[15:15] okay wait maybe I can open it up
[15:17] somewhere with my own figma
[15:24] if I log in
[15:38] okay there we go
[15:44] here we are
[15:47] maybe I'll steal some of your colors
[15:49] here that are quite nice
[15:56] look for pastel colors
[16:03] for this one we have it already
[16:06] pink blue purple
[16:11] I'll try this
[16:14] when I'm when I'm looking at my design
[16:16] now I feel like it's pretty balloons
[16:23] okay you make it to rounds okay why not
[16:27] I know it's not actually round it's like
[16:28] really
[16:31] uh
[16:36] oh this is dope
[16:40] actually
[16:41] I don't know if I should be doing this
[16:43] right now
[16:49] um wait I need to think because uh I
[16:52] feel like if I start to touch a few
[16:54] things I might have to redesign
[16:55] everything so even just the things like
[16:57] the radius
[16:59] that you're using and everything
[17:01] um might have to be careful with that
[17:03] because the goal is to launch in seven
[17:05] days
[17:08] just clear with the radius okay
[17:11] this is queer coal okay
[17:16] yeah not really it's not that it's
[17:19] painful to cut it but it's just
[17:21] um you know I've already done the
[17:22] designs for the stores and everything
[17:25] um and I just want to keep moving on
[17:28] um and ship as fast as I can while
[17:30] keeping the app simple to use I think
[17:32] your design here is just so good I'm
[17:34] gonna do the same
[17:37] um but things like colors and radius and
[17:39] things yeah for the 1.5 yeah
[17:43] I think no but I think there are some
[17:45] valuable things here um
[17:47] that's about creating avataric creatures
[17:50] Parts Avatar so maybe we can I don't
[17:52] know maybe we can try
[17:54] BG
[18:05] you want to see if I get something in
[18:07] there yeah um
[18:09] where is it create
[18:14] and click
[18:19] or dot BG
[18:25] how do you make the Emoji shine
[18:31] and these are just images right
[18:37] all right let's see a few some of them
[18:44] oh I think it's because my background is
[18:46] too it's too dark here
[18:48] oh I see what you did okay
[18:56] oh okay
[19:00] I don't think this is gonna work with
[19:01] very own days
[19:04] I don't know actually it works no it
[19:06] doesn't really work
[19:19] yep I'm gonna have to keep going with
[19:20] the one I have otherwise I will change
[19:22] everything
[19:25] just actually sign up
[19:29] get an avatar of you just after the sign
[19:33] up no need to redirected this word uh
[19:36] okay maybe we can even do it before the
[19:40] before the onboarding
[19:43] like before the user signed up when you
[19:45] sign up you have already your avatar
[19:48] what do you think about that
[19:51] okay
[19:57] okay that's smart so okay it's time to
[20:00] check those designs so
[20:03] um okay I let her name goal
[20:06] four five six seven eight
[20:10] yeah exactly yeah exactly yeah
[20:13] and people like when they give you your
[20:14] email at least they know why they give
[20:16] you their email that's smart
[20:22] maybe the goal
[20:26] um instead of having a select we can
[20:27] have a div
[20:29] class next yeah two
[20:34] we can do an array
[20:39] of uh
[20:42] here we can have a span
[20:45] e0
[20:50] do you think it's clear that the goal is
[20:53] how many times a week you're gonna do
[20:55] this maybe go
[21:04] up to okay
[21:08] what do you guys think um I'm trying to
[21:10] copy this part the gold stuff
[21:13] I'm just wondering if people will
[21:14] understand that one x equal once a week
[21:17] and 7x equal seven times a week
[21:21] in the meantime I'll try to start
[21:23] cutting something
[22:26] extra days workouts a week
[22:29] workouts per week
[22:31] goals times a week
[22:34] okay yeah maybe we can do workouts per
[22:36] week
[22:46] I don't know just Spice in
[22:58] how do I spread Flex
[23:04] oh yeah Flex one here here
[23:51] okay
[23:53] okay
[23:56] yep okay
[24:00] and eggs and eggs
[24:02] um
[24:03] gold
[24:06] let's submit survival
[24:15] um
[24:27] and uh ring
[24:30] you ring
[24:33] memory
[24:36] or nothing
[24:48] oh actually I could have just used
[24:49] something
[25:25] okay
[25:29] hey not bad
[25:32] uh
[25:57] I know oh [ __ ]
[26:09] I'm gonna do the same way as here
[26:11] or maybe button with no animation
[26:17] okay
[26:20] let's go okay
[26:28] okay and go per week
[26:31] completion up to XP a week okay
[26:35] all right I think it's a bit better
[26:37] let's see what you have on the pigma
[26:41] okay
[26:54] oh [ __ ]
[27:12] up to okay
[27:14] cool per week
[27:19] four five one
[27:25] um
[27:45] if I create with once a week
[27:51] uh yep it's still there and if I create
[27:55] with four times a week
[28:02] I have them all
[28:04] okay I own
[28:10] okay that looks better
[28:13] yo video it's going well man submitted
[28:15] yesterday on the stores app store Google
[28:17] Store uh it's live on the way with the
[28:19] payment link and now it's a matter of
[28:21] redesigning some core features of the
[28:23] app to make things a bit simpler
[28:30] just send this super amazing design so
[28:33] I'm taking some inspiration to uh
[28:36] um you know copy and and try to see in
[28:39] the app what screens I can make better
[28:42] so good looking

[29:04] is for link
[29:08] no
[29:20] reward okay hero

[32:12] it should show me good morning
[32:14] okay
[32:27] good morning your hero I know what I'm
[32:30] gonna do and this is definitely not
[32:32] needed but I'm gonna do time Superior 2
[32:35] 12 and
[32:37] zero
[32:39] or
[32:41] Legend
[32:46] okay
[32:49] I thought I could click on this
[32:57] okay and we have the Cog stuff
[33:01] so leave maybe
[33:07] a div here
[33:16] um
[33:18] Flex
[33:21] 55
[33:25] between
[33:27] and we are going to add the adjuster
[33:31] button
[33:32] actually a link
[33:37] here hero where are you
[33:43] setting button button Square
[33:47] and ghosts
[33:48] and no it has to be the code icon
[33:52] we're going to use heroicones settings
[33:56] and this one
[34:16] okay you're a legend
[34:27] oh that's super cool man I like that I
[34:28] love that
[34:33] maybe uh because it's a header maybe
[34:36] we're gonna do
[34:38] [Music]
[34:38] um
[34:40] a little extra virgin Y2
[34:46] and we're going to give it some breathe
[34:51] a legend
[34:55] oh I think therapy do the margin stuff
[35:02] good morning your Legend
[35:07] okay
[35:10] now this workout Avatar
[35:21] level four
[35:24] okay I love the button at the bottom
[35:30] um render
[35:32] Sports
[35:36] and here
[35:38] we have
[35:40] this then we have this then we have the
[35:43] leaderboard so you're putting the little
[35:44] board higher
[35:51] you don't want to reload bro
[35:54] what did I do
[35:57] without loading
[35:59] you're supposed to show me the little
[36:00] board higher now
[36:05] render sport this is what I've done
[36:11] okay now it's working
[36:14] nobody what was going on
[36:16] leaderboard
[36:20] okay with four
[36:22] um
[36:27] okay
[36:29] complete maybe just your right I think
[36:32] just complete is enough
[36:36] complete
[36:39] I'll wait we are going to put this uh
[36:46] I'm gonna use
[36:49] as colors that I have already uh
[36:55] maybe the primary it's too much Henry
[36:59] accent
[37:01] neutral
[37:10] I think here complete and once it's
[37:12] completed when yeah once I've clicked on
[37:15] it it becomes completed I think
[37:23] do you think for the card
[37:25] um in your design you have uh different
[37:27] colors
[37:28] um I don't have the the same colors as
[37:30] you so maybe
[37:32] you think I can have some kind of like a
[37:34] divider or a border
[37:37] or something
[37:39] because I have access to some colors
[37:42] from Daisy UI
[37:46] um I use this one for the backgrounds I
[37:49] use this one for the card backgrounds
[37:52] I don't know which one I could use to
[37:54] make it shine a little bit
[37:57] okay
[38:00] so
[38:03] oops
[38:06] just as a test divider
[38:09] all right this is how a divider would
[38:11] look like
[38:14] it adds a lot of space
[38:18] we could just put on a border
[38:29] complete
[38:38] maybe the button needs to be just a
[38:40] proper button a small one
[39:17] oh okay
[39:22] maybe I can do and try this
[39:26] um
[39:29] button exit
[39:33] I don't know if that's too much
[39:38] I think it's the same color as this
[39:40] thing here
[39:42] here either is the same
[39:48] I'm checking if you you know what you
[39:50] think but as a designer
[39:52] person think
[40:04] okay
[40:05] okay man cool
[40:07] League level two I think I need to
[40:09] rework a little bit that part as you did
[40:11] well in your figma
[40:15] okay
[40:17] when I look at your design I'm like [ __ ]
[40:20] what am I doing with my
[40:22] uh League level two okay
[40:26] that's working
[40:30] oh okay
[40:37] that's the same phone size
[40:44] um
[40:47] we have a where are we here
[40:51] that's my avatar
[40:53] these two so here you have a div
[40:57] is class
[41:00] Alex
[41:01] if I between
[41:05] and you have the level
[41:14] and this thing here
[41:28] please
[41:34] um and then I have the streak which is
[41:37] this thing
[42:00] two
[42:01] three equal one
[42:04] you are here
[42:06] text SM
[42:08] we just split both
[42:11] small
[42:13] text-based contents
[42:17] okay
[42:19] uh
[42:34] we can try something fancy here
[42:37] BG base
[42:41] whatever I think we want
[42:44] it
[42:55] um
[43:18] if you're still here menu do you have
[43:19] any idea how would I
[43:21] um
[43:22] create this kind of color
[43:25] underneath the trick the streak or this
[43:29] like which color could I use for that to
[43:31] highlight just a little bit
[43:36] here a good background 100.
[43:42] thanks please that's it
[43:46] the same note
[43:49] almost
[43:50] um background neutral I think it's gonna
[43:52] be too much
[43:54] next neutral content
[44:01] yeah it's a bit too much
[44:03] laughs
[44:14] what can I do here
[44:22] what colors do I have
[44:24] for your black opacity light
[44:34] um
[44:37] foreign
[44:40] that case I just used this one
[44:45] because it's a color it's actually the
[44:47] same background color as the one I use
[44:49] or
[44:50] or oh wait I have an ID it's a poor
[44:53] really poor designer ID but I'm gonna
[44:54] give it a try
[44:58] what do you think
[45:16] it kind of try to get the orange color
[45:19] it works
[45:21] I think X to that
[45:23] oh putting X
[45:26] okay
[45:28] so cutting we'll keep the putting y
[45:33] one and the padding X to 1.5 Maybe
[45:37] Legend
[45:42] you let me know
[45:44] I'm uh I'm working on autopilot based on
[45:47] what you say
[45:49] so we have Spiderman and we have the xB
[45:56] uh
[45:58] [Music]
[46:06] no it's probably not the right div here
[46:10] the progress bar I'm gonna have to
[46:12] change a little bit
[46:16] oh dang I almost feel like
[46:18] I put too much colors I should have
[46:20] never have the green
[46:22] damn it
[46:23] because actually I think the old app
[46:25] could be
[46:28] could be red no it's like it feels like
[46:30] it's um I know it feels built like this
[46:33] color relates much more to work out than
[46:36] than the green one
[46:42] I don't want to change the App Store
[46:43] screenshots
[46:48] um
[46:50] what do we have
[46:51] the name oh yeah the name
[46:56] oh okay is that name
[47:00] here we have saved
[47:03] is my name
[47:05] last
[47:06] so many Bolt
[47:09] metal lifter
[47:13] okay maybe we're just gonna reduce
[47:17] face where is the space
[47:28] maybe I just don't use any of this
[47:31] and I do
[47:33] origin button two
[47:39] is a very much a color palette yeah yeah
[47:41] that's it
[47:42] many of these ain't GPT
[47:50] ah the rear companies all right
[47:53] I'm gonna add this right now
[48:01] I think this gets to be my favorite
[48:03] property app ever
[48:05] if that's no I think that's not the one
[48:06] I'm using
[48:08] um okay
[48:16] here we go
[48:33] in habit Garden yeah exactly the same
[48:36] one from Habits garden and actually what
[48:38] I'm gonna do is I'm gonna check habits
[48:40] Garden The Habit card
[48:43] I'm gonna copy the codes or do something
[48:45] very similar
[48:47] I'm pretty onwards in my habits
[48:51] I'm fatigue
[48:52] hey okay we're gonna do this
[48:58] um
[49:11] you don't want to complete Army okay
[49:15] and here on complete
[49:19] new data and then we're gonna show some
[49:21] companies
[49:23] visible for Rich motion origin
[49:27] uh maybe we could just kind of try the
[49:29] company before we make the API call
[49:32] uh what is going on module let's phone
[49:35] you didn't install canva company
[49:39] oh I mean the wrong app God damn it
[49:42] uh see the the hero of herofits
[49:47] and reinstall canva competition
[49:53] npme converts
[49:58] and just
[49:59] quick detail uh CD dot CD kids
[50:05] and then fpm
[50:10] I'm gonna remove it
[50:12] up
[50:13] so here we're back ready Bingo we have
[50:18] some companies
[50:20] so cute
[50:22] oh my God it's so pleasurable
[50:27] um
[50:28] I could just make at the bottom of the
[50:30] screen where are the confetti
[50:37] and velocity origin spread and Max
[50:40] [Music]
[50:40] um
[50:44] origin what is the documentation for
[50:46] origin
[50:48] number default is 0.5
[50:50] position a bit zero of the beginning on
[50:52] the left with zero from the beginning of
[50:55] the less Edge okay so maybe one
[51:00] a pitch
[51:01] one and one or something like zero eight
[51:04] and zero eight
[51:15] are we good with that
[51:19] looks nice maybe we make some more
[51:20] companies
[51:22] maybe angle we're gonna make it ready
[51:27] whatever that was good
[51:30] to count spread
[51:33] maybe 80 let's spread
[51:36] 60.
[51:40] all right it's a bit different filling
[51:46] all good guys
[51:51] oh bottom center okay so more like a
[51:53] I'll do okay and why not
[51:58] okay it was now
[52:00] we can try this if you want zero five
[52:02] one
[52:03] I probably hear zero nine oh no
[52:14] and
[52:16] angle would be
[52:18] I don't know exactly how they do that
[52:23] is it better from the bottom of the
[52:24] screen
[52:34] very cute it makes sense because it's a
[52:36] center
[52:43] but we get manual uh confirmation we can
[52:47] move ahead
[52:49] okay we've got the confettis
[52:51] um back to the name so we're gonna do
[52:53] Comfort tea when we get the API call
[52:57] here
[53:02] and we are going back to the bar
[53:06] cheers
[53:07] here progress level up yeah this way is
[53:10] where we are
[53:15] let's do it sunny ah
[53:18] better to be of Empire
[53:20] a complete oh [ __ ]
[53:25] Kelly Slater level four XP maybe the
[53:29] name I think here is a bit too big
[53:33] what you do right
[53:36] yeah you do it smaller than the rest
[53:40] and then uh this is where the
[53:43] perfectionism thing is going to kick in
[53:46] I have a feeling that this actually
[53:48] should be accent
[53:53] content
[53:56] oh maybe it's just here
[53:59] can I have a feeling that uh
[54:02] the whole color of the app is going to
[54:04] change
[54:05] uh background accent 10.
[54:10] is this
[54:12] Yeah it's red on the bottom here right
[54:16] oh yeah it is
[54:21] foreign
[54:23] looks like it applies some kind of
[54:25] colors that I didn't choose it's kind of
[54:27] Gray
[54:28] I think it's okay
[54:46] that's the one I applied by okay
[54:50] uh
[54:53] background color
[54:55] that's the one I add block size
[54:59] order book sizing color oh
[55:04] oh
[55:06] it adds a color here
[55:11] H background bass content
[55:26] does it apply
[55:29] how is that color coming from
[55:43] roots
[55:47] let me show me again color it's coming
[55:49] from
[55:53] okay Roots color
[55:57] all right it doesn't matter
[55:59] um
[56:00] should be doing this
[56:10] okay I think we are good
[56:12] um maybe
[56:15] you guys think it's a bit better not
[56:17] better maybe the league the render
[56:19] leaderboard
[56:20] stuff should not be primary but
[56:24] maybe I'm just gonna replace okay I'm
[56:27] gonna I'm gonna take everything that is
[56:29] gonna be primary is going to be replaced
[56:32] by
[56:35] accent color and bingo we are yeah okay
[56:39] that makes a bit more sense now
[56:41] so I'm not supposed to have two colors
[56:43] here but it's because I created two
[56:46] avatars only my name will be in this
[56:49] color but the other people will be in
[56:51] Black
[56:53] I can't like they'll all be like this
[57:01] all right
[57:08] um it's not really readable
[57:17] x x and consonant
[57:19] [Music]
[57:20] um
[57:21] maybe what we need to do
[57:30] maybe what we need to do here is to
[57:32] change the color based on the level
[57:34] X accent contents and here if I do
[57:38] something like
[57:48] uh s dot x a or maybe just the value
[57:58] related to the next level that
[58:00] experience required
[58:06] if this
[58:09] is superior to 0.2
[58:13] we do a
[58:18] text connection content
[58:21] for Texas content
[58:23] if this is superior to 0.2 we're going
[58:26] to do
[58:32] that's the opposite
[58:40] but here I show the XB here
[58:44] and then here it becomes
[58:46] and I just need to find
[58:49] a sweet spot uh
[58:54] 0.2 I would like fake oh yeah
[58:58] maybe I'll do something like uh
[59:02] 20.
[59:09] wait wait what am I doing
[59:13] Max
[59:16] just stick level one
[59:20] oh yeah because it was over stuff okay
[59:25] so if I have a F5
[59:30] and here I have five
[59:37] oh no no so the one and here I have five
[59:42] okay
[59:43] if I have
[59:46] um two
[59:50] okay that's where the issue happens if I
[59:52] have 2.1
[59:57] so maybe I need 2.5
[60:00] should be the limit
[60:19] so this should still should it still
[60:21] should be
[60:26] it should still be the text accent
[60:29] content
[60:32] so if I go 2.1
[60:37] wait what am I doing I'm a stupid word
[60:42] anyway it's never gonna work
[60:46] asking help from uh from YouTube
[60:51] developer name should be closer
[60:54] okay and then the text in the coach
[61:07] that is darker than your accent
[61:10] okay
[61:14] I think it's a way better when you limit
[61:16] the use of accent color
[61:18] around twenty percent yeah yeah
[61:21] oh so you guys do you guys think it's
[61:23] getting too much to
[61:25] colorful come out
[61:50] yeah just do this
[61:53] okay yeah I think I'm going to leave it
[61:54] gray
[62:11] okay I'm Gonna Leave it gray I think it
[62:12] makes more sense
[62:14] and uh
[62:19] oh it's not perfect I think I'm gonna
[62:21] we're gonna go that way
[62:23] I'm gonna go that way
[62:25] it's not gonna be perfect at some part
[62:27] the XP will be a little weird color
[62:31] whoa it's gonna work out
[62:38] okay yeah
[62:40] um the screen tip level and name should
[62:42] be closer
[62:43] than the text and the coach
[62:48] and it takes any good
[62:49] team
[62:51] any sense information level and names
[62:54] for this and this
[62:56] should be closer than text
[62:59] and the gosh so closer than Spiderman
[63:02] and
[63:04] the progress bar is it do I understand
[63:06] well
[63:20] so I should you should I think I should
[63:23] lower the The Experience bar here maybe
[63:26] by four
[63:30] something like this
[63:57] so cute
[64:03] you can try to get the two text closure
[64:05] just show how good it looks
[64:07] um I think I can try but I might just
[64:10] have issues because
[64:12] I need to do some weird
[64:14] faster than
[64:16] um
[64:17] this is my texts and I'm gonna have to
[64:20] do something like margin button 0.5 and
[64:23] make this negative
[64:26] maybe we can go up to one
[64:30] how is that
[64:47] okay leave it that's fine don't do
[64:50] negative Mark it's really bad yeah it's
[64:52] a it's a hacky stuff actually do you
[64:54] think it looks bad I think it looks good
[64:56] now
[64:57] pretty it seems pretty simple
[66:00] oh
[66:03] okay okay
[66:06] I need help me help you I
[66:10] okay
[66:30] all right um
[66:35] we can remove this now we have to change
[66:37] the color of every details
[66:40] every primary action in the app I love
[66:43] it
[66:46] margin but um equal one maybe which is
[66:48] two leading
[66:51] or
[66:57] oh no that's another one
[66:59] oh yeah that's the one
[67:13] maybe we go this way
[67:16] seems cool
[67:22] okay so the basic stuff good morning
[67:24] your Legends
[67:26] you're seeing that buzz Lookouts uh we
[67:29] don't really care I had a sport Avatar
[67:31] and then on my create
[67:33] we're going to change primary stuff
[67:39] or accents
[67:46] okay
[67:47] same for sign up and sign in
[67:54] primary is going to be completely
[67:55] different there's only one actually
[68:00] and for
[68:02] the login
[68:05] just one
[68:07] okay
[68:11] all right we good
[68:24] all right my new you're the king
[68:26] the design looks much better now thank
[68:27] you bed
[68:34] hero
[68:35] oh maybe the sign of okay right
[68:37] it's in it's Saturday it's Sunday so we
[68:39] can do some procrastination things
[68:42] I think these look [ __ ] awesome
[68:45] in the center it's actually looking
[68:46] better
[68:49] welcome back
[68:50] Center
[68:54] and here random Emoji uh
[68:59] how does this stuff look like
[69:01] I just have an image in the center so
[69:03] maybe I wrap it
[69:07] um in a div
[69:19] background
[69:21] phase I'll be right
[69:26] um
[69:27] founded
[69:32] in here we are going to do something
[69:35] even more dirty
[69:54] yeah we're going to keep the rounded
[69:56] stuff like this
[69:57] all right I think it looks better
[70:00] a bit more inviting
[70:04] yeah I think it is so we're gonna copy
[70:06] that thing
[70:08] and put it for this
[70:27] color gray is pretty strong I think you
[70:29] may have a bit lighter
[70:33] oh yeah that's true
[70:35] I don't know how I can change the color
[70:37] in this UI that way
[70:39] um
[70:43] I want to change this
[70:48] something
[70:50] oh no maybe just in colors somewhere at
[70:52] the bottom I can change
[70:55] how to use
[70:56] nope
[70:58] uh config
[71:05] customize component probably not
[71:11] oh okay the theme
[71:13] then probably
[71:17] it might tell wheat uh
[71:21] telling Daisy okay I need to take all
[71:24] this
[71:27] and here
[71:31] or
[71:33] wow

[72:24] also we change oh [ __ ]
[72:28] yeah it was not bad actually yeah I
[72:30] think that's what they use here it looks
[72:32] pretty cool
[72:35] uh but though bro I just I don't want to
[72:38] change everything
[72:43] and maybe you know what maybe I'm
[72:44] bothering with details maybe I'll just
[72:47] gonna go like this
[72:48] so the documents background base
[72:52] um what is the face cover
[73:11] is this one
[73:14] and maybe I'll put
[73:17] uh

[75:35] support Avatar
[75:38] go per week I watch our name
[75:44] all right sounds good
[75:46] we have some primary colors somewhere
[75:48] hidden
[75:51] 404 doesn't matter sign up

[76:50] it's Sunday it's okay
[76:58] um
[77:26] all right
[77:28] and
[77:33] oh I know maybe
[77:42] I just app
[77:55] your upgrade oh yeah come on there we go
[77:58] I read your mind
[78:07] okay I think this is good
[78:09] um all right I need to do
[78:12] I need to show
[78:14] when you when you level up I'll need to
[78:16] show to the user because it's not clear
[78:18] you level up you can see the character
[78:21] is getting bigger but
[78:25] he needs a little extra so I'm gonna
[78:27] replace uh what did I do here
[78:32] we're gonna say uh
[78:36] new color
[78:41] of your gosh the empty background could
[78:43] match the background
[78:45] Shrek tag so you understand that
[78:46] completing a strike will impact the
[78:48] coach
[78:49] the strike
[78:54] oh this uh here
[78:58] this part you say that it should be the
[79:00] same color as this thing in this trick
[79:06] I tried just a little bit earlier
[79:09] um
[79:11] it just it feels a little bit too much
[79:15] um background Bass
[79:17] like
[79:18] a bigger accents it just feels like um
[79:30] actually the color is not the same
[79:33] I don't know why
[79:35] because I think there is some kind of a
[79:37] by default
[79:40] the color is
[79:43] I think there is this stuff being
[79:45] applied
[79:47] is it
[79:49] nope
[79:51] why does it look like there is a gray
[79:54] stuff on on it
[80:01] border it's not the Border
[80:04] in case I'm gonna check no
[80:12] I don't know if it's just me man but I
[80:13] feel like this background on the
[80:15] progress bar
[80:16] is not the same as the one at the top he
[80:19] feels like it's a mix of the accent
[80:21] color orange one and
[80:24] some other
[80:25] grayish stuff
[80:30] this is the one I applied this is the
[80:32] one it wants
[80:33] if there's any filter or something on it
[80:44] I don't know
[80:57] I think I'm gonna
[80:59] yeah otherwise I will have to dig into
[81:01] CSS stuff in a probably I won't I want
[81:05] to make the that
[81:07] oops oops I want to make just the user
[81:09] experience a bit better with using
[81:12] um something else probably
[81:15] see I lost the chats what's going on
[81:18] uh
[81:20] Twitter
[81:29] can I pop out the chat from here
[81:33] yep
[81:42] correct okay
[81:44] okay

[93:14] uh sport turns which doesn't really
[93:17] matter gain rest that XP to gain
[93:21] and if

[101:03] [Music]
[101:21] and you aspire to build your own startup
[101:25] is that what part what's way you're part
[101:27] of the building public community
[102:00] you need to change
[102:16] I have to do this
[102:22] oh [ __ ] I didn't pay attention to that
[102:24] too
[102:30] I'll Ctrl C for I can forget
[102:33] Color Picker
[102:36] oh [ __ ] I could have just
[102:38] mark
[102:53] maybe just
[102:55] is this
[103:13] I just dropped the exact same thing mark
[103:20] more seriously
[103:27] why
[103:33] seriously Mark
[104:06] some point they'll be a new thing every
[104:08] day and always watch what what people
[104:10] are building nice
[104:15] nice nice especially with them up
[104:41] ding ding ding
[104:43] thank you
[104:47] okay
[104:49] and for the App Store
[104:54] make sure you always have to change the
[104:55] screenshots inside oh yeah for the
[104:57] background I
[104:59] I'm at a point where
[105:01] um I don't want to spend too much time
[105:03] and going through the simulator and risk
[105:06] screenshot like cropping and everything
[105:07] again
[105:09] I have a feeling that uh I'm just gonna
[105:11] skip that part
[105:18] that's weird you talk to me yes what do
[105:20] you mean your name is Mark
[105:22] yeah
[105:24] it's a menu menu Mark I'm wondering how
[105:28] come the what's the connection
[105:41] oh maybe I'll do this later
[105:44] then I'm gonna okay I'm gonna do this
[105:46] later
[105:48] all right so we have
[105:50] um let's say use a new a new Mark Duty
[105:56] signs this is done show message this is
[106:00] done delete edit
[106:02] all right so I won't yeah I think people
[106:04] should be able to delete
[106:06] everyone calls me menu since I'm a kid
[106:11] but your but your real name on your ID
[106:12] card is Mark
[106:27] oh okay that makes sense yeah
[106:31] yeah okay that makes sense
[106:34] manual Mark is much easier for people I
[106:36] guess especially in the US market
[106:37] Manuela
[106:39] good luck seeing that
[106:43] good to see another Mark in the in the
[106:46] journey
[106:47] okay moving on to the editing
[106:54] oh maybe I can steal your mind
[107:00] so
[107:03] let me show you what we have what we
[107:05] have here I think people should be able
[107:07] to edit the name of their avatars and
[107:10] eventually to delete it so I'm gonna
[107:12] have to create an edit delete page
[107:15] I'm wondering how would I link this card
[107:19] to the edit page how do people know they
[107:22] can tap somewhere to edit the characters
[107:26] if you're up for a challenge
[107:32] in the meantime I'm gonna create the
[107:34] page
[107:37] um
[107:40] I'll need I think I'll need an API route
[107:43] as well
[107:46] app
[107:47] um
[107:49] Maybe
[107:50] sport
[107:52] here edit
[107:56] and then
[108:07] oh maybe no

[118:04] the idea of trimming lasers as if as a
[118:06] fun followers and retweet and then you
[118:08] must be run as a solopreneur have you
[118:10] ever considered building with a team hey
[118:11] yo Robert good morning
[118:13] um
[118:14] I I've done some apps with people before
[118:17] and it just doesn't really work really
[118:19] well I don't think people like to work
[118:22] with me for some reason
[118:24] um and I just like also the idea of
[118:25] being independent uh something I really
[118:28] fight for
[118:29] so mostly not but uh that's something is
[118:32] happening today like with those live
[118:34] stream I can feel like some people from
[118:35] Twitter are coming in and
[118:38] um sharing some of their work sometimes
[118:40] people will help fixing bugs and we're
[118:42] having a fun with Manu he's a designer
[118:45] in New York and he sent me those amazing
[118:48] design early this morning
[118:51] um and the app looked like this at the
[118:52] beginning and it turned it into
[118:54] something like this which is much better
[118:57] uh so it's funny it's a kind of like a
[118:59] crowdsource stuff not really a team but
[119:01] uh
[119:03] here we go that's so fun
[119:10] bro so
[119:14] mutate
[119:26] are you doing
[119:39] if you're going to get URL you are not
[119:42] calling anything are you
[119:45] it's
[119:48] are you somehow calling something
[119:53] I miss me something
[120:17] uh maybe if we try to create
[120:21] uh API support ID you're not hitting the
[120:25] API for some reason
[120:27] maybe try and get it
[120:46] what am I doing wrong here
[120:50] a little data
[120:52] you're supposed oh yeah I don't push
[120:55] this here doesn't work
[120:59] I'm still not calling anything
[121:19] I mean you're not doing the call already
[121:22] explain me what's going on export
[121:24] default function app
[121:30] oh maybe because you already have it
[121:38] then you're still supposed to call
[121:39] something
[121:59] okay no APA call is being made
[122:05] use API client kids
[122:11] or not ID
[122:14] I am just supposed to make
[122:43] oh you really don't want to do it though
[122:55] what am I doing wrong here
[123:08] use
[123:10] usually you are
[123:13] doing it here
[123:21] what am I doing wrong
[123:29] come on bro
[123:54] I ain't no strange here
[123:59] why it doesn't appear in my network oh
[124:01] maybe because I don't return anything
[124:04] wait
[124:07] you're trying to call it
[124:16] would it be because you're
[124:31] you're supposed to show me something no
[125:14] I said how long have you been studying
[125:16] software development uh I think
[125:18] maybe six or seven years
[125:21] um but not really not professionally at
[125:24] all just cutting stuff so I make a lot
[125:26] of mistakes and I'm not very uh
[125:29] uh well structured when I do it
[125:33] and this is my first time on the Stream
[125:35] I'm not good about oh okay
[125:39] I'm subtracted by trade yeah same for me
[125:41] man
[125:42] um
[125:43] I have supposed to make a simple API
[125:45] call here
[125:47] with this function
[125:49] and nothing is being made
[125:52] which is really strange because uh in
[125:55] here in the other routes I have the same
[125:57] function here
[125:59] and uh if I go back the coal is being
[126:02] made to the user endpoints
[126:06] I just don't know why it's not working
[126:10] when I when I am on this page for some
[126:12] reason
[126:18] could it be sport maybe we try something
[126:21] else
[126:21] um blah.js
[126:24] if we copy this everybody here and then
[126:28] we go to blah
[126:34] yeah the API call is still not be made
[126:36] okay
[126:38] or
[126:43] just go
[126:45] there
[126:48] again copy and past
[126:53] e and if I go to
[127:02] he doesn't make the call as well
[127:08] okay all right I think I need a coffee
[127:12] I'm being nuts operational at all right

[134:31] uh going back to that thing ah of course
[134:34] I know what God damn it this is exactly
[134:36] why coding can be [ __ ]
[134:39] I know exactly why it's not working I
[134:42] need to import my API clients
[134:49] and now it's gonna work of course
[134:52] I don't have a function how come
[134:55] thirsty mark
[134:57] seriously
[135:01] sometimes it's just little details like
[135:03] this you go you go to the toilets you
[135:05] make coffee and you come back and boom
[135:06] here you have
[135:15] okay uh
[135:44] use
[136:19] oh yeah maybe I'm just gonna do this I'm
[136:21] gonna do
[136:23] if ID
[136:29] have a function if
[136:35] hey Google
[136:36] play The Blaze
[137:10] here
[138:33] in my API you don't have the sport bro
[138:37] I just need a back button somewhere
[138:45] import
[138:47] Ant back
[139:07] okay
[139:08] um so we're making the call it's fine on
[139:10] the API side we return
[139:14] um
[139:23] a
[139:26] h
[139:29] okay menu I'm on it
[139:32] checking it so we have
[139:33] okay
[139:36] I did support Avatar oh yeah okay
[139:40] edit
[139:44] okay you have the edit button here
[139:49] and on this one you would have an icon
[139:51] oh maybe I'd like
[139:54] I like both
[139:57] um let's see how that goes with my
[139:59] current broken design
[140:02] I'm probably going to try both the hero
[140:04] icons
[140:06] um edit
[140:10] probably this
[140:12] and we are going to go to the Index app
[140:17] and emoji
[140:24] so basically would be somewhere around
[140:29] with this relative
[140:33] let me do a span
[140:37] that we're gonna say about a class name
[140:40] button
[140:41] button ghosts
[140:49] absolute
[140:53] absolute
[140:55] button zero
[140:58] right zero
[141:03] and we're gonna do button maybe Xs
[141:07] oh no maybe I just need to change this
[141:11] five
[141:23] how do you do this
[141:25] okay
[141:45] I don't know maybe the edit is a bit
[141:48] simpler
[141:50] um
[142:05] and how about
[142:09] I don't think this is gonna work
[142:19] I'm not next to the name
[142:21] we do something like
[142:27] in the very like class text SM
[142:31] oh it's normal
[142:39] please
[142:54] or I try this
[143:04] here's how do Twitter do that
[143:09] edit profile okay
[143:35] and it's sunny again
[143:42] I mean I like this part here the top
[143:46] right it was cute
[143:51] oh you're okay you're working on it nice
[144:00] all right you know what I I have some
[144:02] work to be done to make this available
[144:04] later I'll let you uh
[144:06] how did you play around with this and
[144:08] I'm gonna be on the page
[144:10] I'm gonna make sure it works
[144:13] um
[144:17] and maybe just for now to help I'm going
[144:20] to
[144:26] wait
[144:29] um
[144:32] here we're going to have a link
[144:40] and we're gonna say it
[144:45] app dot sport Dot
[144:48] that ID
[144:57] normally when I click it on my page
[145:02] um
[145:08] I start stealing some of your design
[145:10] edit support evidence
[145:12] I think this will
[145:23] I don't know if people can edit their
[145:25] avatars I don't think so
[145:27] don't mix wait you pick another tar
[145:30] now I see I think people will just be
[145:33] able to edit their name and goals
[145:38] and delete their avatars if they want
[145:47] create
[145:49] page
[145:51] the title was create
[145:55] maybe you could just teal all that code
[146:05] of
[146:07] I'm gonna put this in here
[146:13] and of course you're not going to be
[146:15] happy
[146:16] Kindle edits
[146:21] name and goal
[146:23] and errors
[146:42] and what do we have we have the function
[146:43] as well to create
[146:46] is loading uh
[146:49] he's loading we just want to import it
[146:51] as these beta
[146:54] pudding
[146:59] error
[147:01] data
[147:03] [Music]
[147:06] and we're gonna call my routes
[147:09] or dot edit
[147:14] maybe we just called it yeah we're going
[147:16] to call the Post function okay here API
[147:18] posts
[147:20] boards
[147:22] um
[147:23] ID
[147:31] and we're gonna press it the name and
[147:33] the goal
[147:35] is loading push app error okay here
[147:41] data
[147:46] and this here
[147:49] is loading he's loading the data
[147:56] setup is data loading
[148:00] okay
[148:02] name new state is not defined of course
[148:08] uh yeah we don't need the least
[148:13] and I'll create it
[148:18] uh here handle create
[148:21] I'm gonna rename handle edit
[148:26] we also need
[148:28] the name
[148:32] reference is loading
[148:36] oh yeah I did an important that
[148:44] and same here
[148:50] so we have the Avatar we have that thing
[148:55] what we're gonna do is when we get the
[148:58] data
[149:06] data
[149:08] are going to do sits a name
[149:13] and oh you're here we need sport as well
[149:18] chords
[149:20] it's Sports
[149:22] and for that we do sit
[149:27] That's Sports
[149:29] data does
[149:30] Sports
[149:32] that's four dots I think
[149:39] support the sport dot Emoji ID
[149:51] support.name I think is how we call it
[149:55] yep and here for sets all and uh
[150:17] [Music]
[150:19] data dots
[150:22] board I think
[150:28] is the data we have
[150:30] oh I think it's data that's res is it
[150:36] it's for it
[150:38] uh we are calling this API route
[150:46] building this API rounds
[150:51] uh console
[150:55] of the sports
[151:01] we send you back a sport
[151:05] records
[151:11] um
[151:16] what's going on
[151:34] you're calling it but you're never
[151:36] returning it oh return
[151:39] okay then that works
[151:46] you see return this board that's fine
[151:50] getting back to it
[151:51] um
[151:53] once you have the data you feel the data
[151:55] in the form
[151:58] okay I can edit
[152:04] or yeah I don't need to change that
[152:09] and so when I edit I'm going to do a
[152:11] post sport ID and maybe patch
[152:16] or the name
[152:20] um
[152:22] oh I need to show you the sport you have
[152:33] edit
[152:36] work Avatar
[152:40] and in the form we have Dave
[152:46] um we have as your
[152:50] or Dot
[152:53] export
[152:55] it is and we need the Emoji so we're
[152:57] going to go to the list of sports
[153:01] get Sports
[153:06] it's a sport
[153:10] here
[153:11] [Music]
[153:13] it's board That's Sports
[153:16] and then that demog
[153:21] class text or Excel
[153:28] Maybe 5xl
[153:34] fitter
[153:36] gold per week
[153:38] and here we're gonna have edits up there
[153:43] or maybe just save
[153:45] change
[153:47] save changes
[153:57] you cannot push yep
[154:00] and to finish I should
[154:04] go
[154:06] um
[154:10] and I should have l
[154:12] request that method equal uh
[154:23] uh please again
[154:26] how to do exactly the same thing
[154:35] and then I'm gonna get this port from
[154:38] the database and its ports dots name
[154:42] equal requests
[154:44] because that body
[154:47] dot name
[154:50] or dots go
[154:53] equal this and I think there's nothing
[154:55] else we can change the Avatar will stay
[154:57] the same
[154:59] and we're going to do the weight
[155:01] or dot save
[155:03] red
[155:09] okay
[155:10] all right let's give it a try it's a bit
[155:12] bold
[155:17] but done
[155:18] API support
[155:22] uh okay else oh yeah else if
[155:30] all right
[155:31] it works
[155:34] I click it if I
[155:38] nope gets the wrong name once a week and
[155:42] Federer
[155:45] so this is updated in here
[155:49] but for some reason you use it pulls the
[155:51] wrong data oh because he doesn't
[155:54] revalidate the sports because you've
[155:55] already done it
[155:57] everybody didn't Focus
[156:00] I released it yeah maybe yes
[156:05] a
[156:09] here
[156:11] okay that works now seven times a week
[156:19] fine this is working
[156:22] okay
[156:23] I'm back and back and back done I made
[156:25] it simpler version on the bottom with
[156:27] 3DS menu I can see what you think
[156:33] okay
[156:36] I think I'm gonna give this a little
[156:38] commit
[156:45] uh we have new routes we have this stuff
[156:48] to level up and stuff
[156:52] and stuff
[156:55] all right
[156:56] I mean that's geared maybe easier
[156:58] version to implement
[157:00] oh okay
[157:05] okay
[157:06] actually that's pretty simpler yeah
[157:11] first comp
[157:13] and away
[157:23] you're a hero
[157:26] I want to steal this
[157:28] you might steal this
[157:37] okay bro it's nice
[157:40] I'm going to
[157:42] I'm going to check hero icons and and
[157:45] and see which one thank you man you're
[157:47] you're really really so kind
[157:50] that's
[157:53] uh three
[157:56] points
[157:58] Ellipsis horizontal
[158:07] maybe the cook icon makes more sense
[158:10] yeah maybe the code icon will make more
[158:12] sense because people are more used to
[158:14] this I've had this he shouldn't have his
[158:16] garden so many times where people don't
[158:17] understand that these three dots
[158:21] means you can edit I'll go with it
[158:28] Index app
[158:36] level
[158:40] is that name
[158:54] wait I get to change this
[158:56] um so here we go we are here
[159:00] and we need a button
[159:03] with the Cog
[159:06] actually it's not really a button it's
[159:08] more like a link
[159:21] Sports for the tiny okay
[159:24] it's too big we're gonna make it
[159:26] or
[159:29] and we're gonna scroll this as a button
[159:35] but then but then Square
[159:39] but then ghosts
[159:41] but then
[159:43] smxs let's see
[159:47] um and we're going to do margin left
[159:49] Auto
[159:51] and we're gonna do justify
[159:55] starts
[159:58] cap
[159:59] you
[160:12] my feeds back
[160:16] it's working bro
[160:19] I'm gonna edit also the user at the top
[160:23] uh outline bingo
[160:27] where is it
[160:32] settings
[160:38] this kind no it doesn't work I need to
[160:40] sorted one
[160:47] okay it works we have a little button
[160:50] here we have the level
[160:52] I need to change the fire Emoji size
[160:55] same size maybe four or five
[161:00] five yeah I think I need to make it four
[161:02] to fit
[161:03] this here
[161:06] uh
[161:11] where are we
[161:14] expected I think that's the one
[161:17] it's gonna still look good yeah not bad
[161:20] it's a bit small 2.5 and let's be greedy
[161:23] no
[161:24] we keep it five
[161:28] kind of looks a little weird
[161:37] maybe that's where also I need to make
[161:39] the leading
[161:41] where is the leading stuff
[161:51] yeah I think you needed a little bit of
[161:53] space
[162:02] two it's two

[167:09] okay and on the API side
[167:13] Port ID
[167:18] this code tells Eve request that method
[167:23] equal delete
[167:31] um
[167:35] sport fine
[167:37] sport doesn't remove now we're set to
[167:39] remove
[167:41] what do they use for the accounts log
[167:43] out setting user
[167:47] await delete user
[168:03] um user library delete user is
[168:08] await
[168:13] to wait
[168:15] Port the delete one and then we need to
[168:19] pass
[168:20] the requests
[168:22] Dot query.id
[168:26] let's give it a try I want to delete
[168:29] Kelly Slater here
[168:31] oh I also need to delete it from my list
[168:36] I need to delete it from at least
[168:39] um
[168:41] like it's yeah a way to
[168:43] request.user.sports.populate
[168:49] boards
[168:52] request.user.sports
[168:55] well actually no I don't even need to
[168:57] populate because I just need to delete
[168:58] the ID request.user.sports
[169:01] let's filter
[169:04] I'm gonna do
[169:07] every sport
[169:12] every sport that is different
[169:16] from requested query. idea
[169:25] request a
[169:27] user.org I think the filter function
[169:30] the filter function filter ask it
[169:33] returns a new Ira or
[169:36] shallow copy version
[169:41] okay so request the
[169:44] user.sports equal recursor user spot
[169:46] filter
[169:47] each sport that is not
[169:51] in the query okay and then wait
[169:57] user dot save
[170:03] let me delete this board and then we
[170:05] delete it from the user stuff and we
[170:08] save the user
[170:10] which means that
[170:12] if I delete this support from the user
[170:17] or delivery sure yep
[170:19] something went wrong
[170:23] show me what happened
[170:26] user isn't defined request a user
[170:30] request a query requisite user oh yeah
[170:34] request a user
[170:36] oh so maybe now I don't have this port
[170:38] anymore because it's been deleted
[170:41] yeah of course it doesn't exist
[170:52] hey it doesn't matter
[170:56] uh we are going back to the app
[171:00] so that my user which is this guide
[171:22] okay you don't even know who the user is
[171:24] oh okay this is the live database for
[171:26] habits Garden of course it's not gonna
[171:29] work

[171:39] 31 Sports
[171:43] if I go back and I want to delete this
[171:46] one I'm going to keep this one I'm going
[171:47] to delete
[171:48] this one
[171:51] let's see if there are any issues
[171:55] so I don't have the tennis anymore this
[171:57] is great and then I'm gonna reload and
[171:59] I'm supposed to have 30 Sports
[172:01] still have 31 probably because the
[172:03] filter function is not working
[172:05] is it filtered
[172:07] here we're going to do something like
[172:09] this uh return
[172:15] console I think it's because I'm
[172:17] comparing comparing
[172:18] object ID of these from mongoose
[172:31] yeah that's the thing uh in mongoose
[172:37] how to turn object ID
[172:42] to string just I think two string
[172:48] yeah
[172:50] getting too far
[172:52] so we do
[172:54] s dot two string
[172:57] and normally here
[173:00] when I delete this pleats workouts
[173:06] and I check the database I should have
[173:07] normally 30 Sports and not 31.
[173:12] okay it looks like it's working
[173:15] then it takes again Tony Hawk
[173:18] um

[173:24] so Tony Oak is now deleted I'm going to
[173:26] refresh check yeah there's no more Tony
[173:28] Hawk and I should have 30 Sports

[176:11] with a coffee
[176:14] so um we're gonna have a quick break on
[176:16] that thing
[176:17] I will leave you with design I mean I
[176:20] think I'm going to stay here and eat
[176:21] here this is the designs from my new
[176:27] oh yeah I'm gonna I have to wait no I

[176:37] you're you or
[176:41] good morning
[176:46] Oh I thought that would could be just
[176:50] a p
[176:52] could be as SVG
[177:03] uh SVG class name you'll accent
[177:13] all right this is your app anyway it's
[177:15] yours now
[177:25] [ __ ] that looks good
[177:27] here are a legend
[177:34] at least later
[177:37] I'm just finishing the code icon stuff
[177:42] before
[177:44] early Slater level six level six
[177:48] we're good
[177:52] watching about a four
[177:54] in gap two fine
[178:00] what do you guys think in terms of
[178:02] design
[178:17] I mean
[178:22] here Jordan
[178:29] oh no I did
[178:34] word ID
[178:41] sport Avatar you go save or delete
[178:52] beautiful
[178:53] ah you guys are too cool all right I
[178:56] think this is all thank you to to menu
[178:59] honestly like
[179:00] look at this this is the previous app I
[179:03] made
[179:04] and this is the updated version
[179:08] [Music]
[179:09] um
[179:14] you'll get to go
[179:24] and on the left side you have my simple
[179:27] version in on the right side you have
[179:29] the designers version
[179:32] dude
[179:33] this is for you when you hear the legend
[179:40] so much better man so much better
[179:47] all right you know I'm gonna eat my
[179:48] delicious croissant because I'm starving
[179:51] and I'm gonna leave those two designs
[179:53] here
[179:55] so we can see before designer after
[179:57] designer
[180:08] it's a good point menu um what I did is
[180:12] so what you can change your avatar names
[180:15] but some people are a bit lazy to type
[180:18] so I suggest them a name
[180:20] I just don't know if I should uh
[180:24] tell them to change the name or
[180:26] something for now it's not unique so as
[180:28] you said people can be yoga to go and
[180:30] there can be many yoga to go
[180:32] uh I just thought you know the my I
[180:35] don't know if they want to type the name
[180:36] or maybe I can change the placeholder
[180:39] instead of the name
[180:41] when the type is gonna suggest oh
[180:44] you're the king
[180:47] 38. Sports uh sets the name
[180:53] maybe we don't do this and maybe just
[180:56] instinct
[181:00] name and here we're going to have placed
[181:02] placeholder
[181:04] name sets placeholder name
[181:09] uh
[181:11] and
[181:15] here we are just going to
[181:18] set the placeholder name
[181:22] then when you create your avatar
[181:27] uh yeah of course I need to display the
[181:29] placeholder
[181:33] placeholder equal
[181:36] take hold their name
[181:38] rocket raspberry so maybe that's better
[181:41] so it leaves people more creativity and
[181:44] and they cannot submit anyway
[181:48] don't duplicate props are loaded oh okay
[181:54] here G Michael Phelps all right maybe
[181:57] that's better
[182:01] that makes more sense here
[182:06] okay that makes more sense yeah if I
[182:08] create one in a test
[182:12] yeah of course I don't have an account
[182:17] okay
[182:18] um just also the S the level
[182:24] that was here
[182:26] it's there
[182:29] render Sports

[182:40] item Center

[199:03] swordlisting
[199:18] okay so

[199:25] I logout I want to be able to log back
[199:27] in
[199:29] but if I want to sign up
[199:41] I think people should sign up with their
[199:44] Sports
[199:46] basically the
[199:51] um
[200:18] maybe I want to make this optional
[200:24] which means if you're here on the sign
[200:26] up page there will be a pop-up for you
[200:31] or you can pick up your avatar
[202:09] you have a pop-up
[202:16] where basically you have
[202:18] reads
[202:21] inside that pop-up you would have
[202:23] basically
[202:25] all that
[202:26] or
[202:34] should we do this
[203:00] and if your model
[203:06] returned
[203:09] and
[204:04] I think he's going to hide the model
[204:43] any friends
[204:45] opacity
[205:04] foreign
[205:35] [Music]
[205:36] and
[205:47] close it

[206:00] 8
[206:02] or workouts

[363:35] or
[363:43] words
[363:45] or depth
[363:46] or the XP
[363:54] the weight is dot save
[363:59] I don't know if that's gonna work
[364:19] uh
[364:22] subtract
[364:24] XP
[364:28] equal one let's do that
[364:56] and we're gonna also do this
[365:15] oh
[365:18] SVG
[365:32] API dot crown
[365:35] okay
[365:39] I want to check
[365:41] c6200

[366:03] minute
[366:12] before
[366:20] foreign
[366:23] oh yeah because I just updated it yeah

[383:26] all right so that's working
[384:24] for none for the energy
[384:26] okay
[387:08] and Google quantities coping email a
[387:11] great enough Linux is true
[387:36] Google the client
[389:22] here we go Google look
[389:32] I know
[390:28] create
[392:59] you had weak no uh I'm gonna do it
[393:01] tomorrow
[393:03] I'm doing this for now
[393:07] and tomorrow I'll do this part
[393:10] but I think the app is pretty much
[393:12] that's the landing page but I think the
[393:15] app the overall app is pretty much done
[393:19] yeah have a look if you want to send you
[393:20] the link
[393:40] your personal info and cleaning your
[393:42] primary
[398:14] sixth week
[398:18] no joke
[399:06] reclinating
[400:43] like give me a second I need to get some
[400:45] credentials from the Play Store
[401:44] okay
[402:31] and the last one iOS
[413:21] okay
[434:13] foreign
[434:21] life
[434:33] no
[444:08] oh
[444:09] hey bro hey video
[444:13] remember when I was I was uh trapped
[444:15] into some weird code stuff
[444:19] I think
[444:21] um I don't know I don't have a real
[444:23] reason honestly it's okay you cannot
[444:25] hear me
[444:27] I mean
[444:32] I think I know wait
[444:37] okay okay
[444:40] this sound what's the setup there
[444:44] okay I um no I I don't
[444:49] I rarely code for more than three hours
[444:53] usually you would see on the live I
[444:54] would do a break every hour or two hours
[444:58] and then I think because I have a really
[445:00] short goal of having the app ready
[445:02] within seven days I'm like I have tons
[445:04] of stuff I want to do
[445:06] and I'm like oh I gotta do these do
[445:08] these do that and uh I don't have much
[445:11] trouble staying on my computer but if I
[445:13] start to have issues like bugs and I
[445:15] cannot fix them then I start to go on
[445:17] Instagram and
[445:19] and do stuff that I don't really want to
[445:21] do
[445:25] sleep also
[445:27] I mean it's something important for for
[445:29] me I can really function well when I'm I
[445:32] have my eight hours of sleep I don't set
[445:34] up alarm and I sleep as much as I need
[445:36] and um even just reading stuff
[445:39] if I if I'm a bit tired I cannot read
[445:42] for instance I can just I'm just gonna
[445:43] fall asleep
[445:44] yeah probably exercise healthy food and
[445:46] sleep okay
[445:51] I'm almost done I'm finishing a few
[445:53] steps so Google login is available

[446:28] Google right
[446:36] wait is Apple going to tell me no way
[446:39] you cannot have Google
[446:45] I hope they don't do that
[446:54] okay you don't think so okay yeah me too
[446:56] that would be weird knowing that 80 of
[446:58] the planet has a Gmail address

[447:16] thanks
[448:08] it with that
[448:14] are you calling from Federico I guess
