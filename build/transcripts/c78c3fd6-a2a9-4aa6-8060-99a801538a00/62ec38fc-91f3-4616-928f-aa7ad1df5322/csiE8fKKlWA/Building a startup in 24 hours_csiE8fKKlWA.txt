[00:00] for my first entrepreneurship project I
[00:01] spent an entire year building a startup
[00:04] I wanted it to be perfect with a bunch
[00:05] of feature user on boarding and a dozens
[00:07] of screens by the end of the year I burn
[00:09] out and I managed to get zero users and
[00:11] made $ Zer actually that's this little
[00:15] first projects right here that you see
[00:17] about 1% of your landing page will
[00:19] convert into paying customers so most
[00:21] people will never use your product and
[00:23] to avoid shipping features that people
[00:24] don't need I recommend you to try the 24
[00:27] hours startup framework if you had to
[00:29] create any startup up in 24 hours how it
[00:31] would look like if we talk about Airbnb
[00:33] it could be just a single spreadsheet
[00:35] and if we are remaking Instagram that
[00:37] could be a public Google Drive I'm not
[00:39] saying you should shap a sketchy version
[00:41] of your product but I'm saying that
[00:42] instead of having a big master plan for
[00:44] your startup start with a very tiny
[00:47] version the 24 hours version of your
[00:49] startup as a Baseline and start building
[00:51] from there
