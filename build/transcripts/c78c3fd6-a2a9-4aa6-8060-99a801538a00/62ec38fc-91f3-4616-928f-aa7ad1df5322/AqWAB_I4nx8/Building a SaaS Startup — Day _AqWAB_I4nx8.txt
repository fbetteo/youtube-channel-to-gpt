[00:00] is it and boom we are live welcome back
[00:02] everyone this is day five of building a
[00:05] little software startup on YouTube
[00:08] twitch and Twitter um in day 1 to three
[00:11] we built a product that is now working
[00:14] and yesterday we had a special guest
[00:15] niiko from Twitter who helped uh me WR
[00:18] write the landing page copy uh we've
[00:21] done that so today was supposed to be
[00:22] the landing page um making part uh I
[00:25] just realized that there is something
[00:26] missing in the product so I'm going to
[00:27] go back at it and uh and finish it but
[00:30] before we move on into coding and
[00:31] explaining what the product does um let
[00:34] me just introduce myself if you have no
[00:36] clue who I am uh my name is Mark I live
[00:39] here in Bali I have um been bu been
[00:43] building a little startup in public on
[00:45] Twitter for two years now and I want to
[00:49] replicate the same thing but here uh
[00:51] live with you know video so you can see
[00:53] behind the sces um I have no uh big
[00:57] Ambitions I don't want any uh VC money
[00:59] or I don't want to create a unicorn I
[01:01] just want to build small internet
[01:03] businesses like those ones that I built
[01:05] here which are now making $55,000 a
[01:07] month in Revenue at 90% profit and zero
[01:10] employee and one of the mo the most
[01:12] common requests that I get from uh
[01:14] customer support is can I get an invoice
[01:16] and can I update my invoice uh invoices
[01:19] especially for Europeans are important
[01:21] they need to add their business details
[01:22] and things like that to it and so I'm
[01:24] building Zenvo so this is a live version
[01:27] of the product that we build in the f in
[01:30] the first days of the stream uh this is
[01:32] actually working uh there's just a few
[01:34] things missing so how does it work it's
[01:36] pretty simple uh you connect you get
[01:38] your uh when you create an account
[01:40] you'll get a link that's connected to
[01:42] all your stripe accounts and then when a
[01:44] customer requests for either an invoice
[01:47] uh generation or an invoice update you
[01:49] send them this link here and then they
[01:52] can retrieve uh with their email they
[01:54] can retrieve all the invoices that
[01:55] they've made with your business or if
[01:57] you have multiple stripe accounts they
[01:58] will be able to retrieve multiple
[01:59] invoices they can download them or they
[02:02] can edit them um for instance here for
[02:04] European sometimes it's important to add
[02:06] their VH details and then they can
[02:08] download the invoice and they're good to
[02:09] go so this is uh live this is actually
[02:12] working uh there's just a few things
[02:14] that are missing in the product and
[02:16] we're going to go over that today um if
[02:18] you
[02:19] are in the in in here now if you can
[02:22] hear me uh please let me know say say hi
[02:24] say where you're coming from uh tell me
[02:25] if the sound is good tell me if the
[02:27] video quality is good just so that I
[02:28] have a little feedback on here
[02:30] and I'm going to check a few
[02:34] things right so at least we're live on
[02:36] YouTube that's for
[02:38] sure making sure making sure I'm not
[02:41] talking in the void which happens
[02:42] sometimes I just realize I forget to
[02:44] press on the
[02:47] stream okay that should be good for
[02:49] YouTube I'm also if you're coming from
[02:50] Twitter I'm going to share a link to the
[02:52] YouTube uh uh stream the quality is so
[02:56] much better there you should be able to
[02:57] see my code my stream um so let me show
[03:00] you the link real
[03:02] quick we have this
[03:05] and we have
[03:09] that and I should be able to get okay I
[03:11] got those messages here on the chats so
[03:13] we are good hello everyone have you
[03:16] watch Putin interview that's a good
[03:18] question to start the this
[03:21] stream hey from France hey bu I'm coming
[03:25] from the Netherland in bag right now
[03:27] while having a morning coffee wow that
[03:29] is a very European thing to do man I
[03:31] envy you so much I can't complain I have
[03:34] a little good T
[03:37] here feature of x.com yeah but the yeah
[03:41] the look yeah the quality of the stream
[03:43] on on X is not is not really good uh go
[03:46] tag Elon mus tell him to change this
[03:47] thing I Tred I tag him every single time
[03:50] I do live uh I think we're far from the
[03:53] YouTube quality so far can I play my
[03:56] start yeah man go go ahead the chat is
[03:58] for that like anything is uh I think
[04:01] we're little very tiny Community here uh
[04:04] I don't I don't believe there are many
[04:05] people watching uh so go ahead chat
[04:07] about your startups chat about
[04:10] anything all right so we have this up
[04:14] and running we have this up and
[04:17] running all right it's time to get back
[04:19] at it so the little product here so this
[04:23] is
[04:23] my environments yeah you should be able
[04:26] to see my screen
[04:28] normally
[04:30] all
[04:31] right this is my local hor okay all
[04:34] right so we we've made a little uh
[04:37] mistake in the first three days we are
[04:40] fetching in the API all the invoices
[04:43] that were made from uh customers who
[04:47] have an invoice so which means the
[04:49] business owner has turned on the stri
[04:51] business owner has turned on the Boolean
[04:53] that says generate an invoice for
[04:55] customers which cost I think
[04:57] 0.4% we also need to generate in
[04:59] invoices for customers who or people who
[05:02] had didn't have this option turn on and
[05:05] so this is what I'm going to be doing
[05:06] today Nico my friend um send me a little
[05:09] piece of code that he he's tried I'm
[05:10] going to see if that works so this code
[05:14] here will fetch
[05:16] invoices for the customers under the
[05:19] email that's provided
[05:21] here um some of them will not have
[05:24] invoices so we have to find the checkout
[05:26] I think first part we have to find the
[05:28] checkout that has been completed
[05:30] under the customer email name this is it
[05:33] and then we need to find payments
[05:37] intents that have succeeded under that
[05:41] checkout session oh let's get into
[05:52] coding ni never sent me the code yeah
[05:54] Nico is a terrible person that's why
[05:57] he's flying away in Bangkok right now is
[05:59] escaping belly because uh you know like
[06:03] he's not welcome here keeps the code for
[06:05] [Music]
[06:06] himself right so normally we get a
[06:08] little helper strip
[06:12] here we're going to create some things
[06:14] that will be called we need to retrieve
[06:17] the checkouts we
[06:26] yeah
[06:28] or
[06:33] this is going to be CH GPT making all my
[06:37] code so yes statu complete customer
[06:41] email right this is exactly the code
[06:43] we've
[06:45] here um we're going to get the sessions
[06:52] back say retrieve
[06:57] checkouts save that
[07:01] okay n still doesn't
[07:04] want export yeah it's exported
[07:07] okay I received that here and we should
[07:11] get all the sessions under this
[07:14] email give it the access token await
[07:17] maybe yep and we give the access token
[07:20] and email we don't have the access token
[07:23] we should have
[07:27] it oh yeah okay okay because I'm calling
[07:30] this I
[07:32] think okay so yeah because people can
[07:35] have multiple strip
[07:37] accounts I need to perform this query
[07:39] for each STP account
[07:44] so okay we have a promise. all inside of
[07:47] a promise.all things are getting serious
[07:57] here need to move that somewhere
[08:06] up Yep this will go somewhere
[08:13] there so we have two types wait I need
[08:15] to clarify this we have two types
[08:18] of way to retrieve invoices
[08:21] either we retrieve the actual invoices
[08:24] for the customer like like proper
[08:27] invoices that have been generated by
[08:29] stripe which means the option was turned
[08:31] on
[08:33] or if the account didn't turn on this
[08:35] option we have this piece of code
[08:39] here
[08:45] so I think I need to comment my code
[08:48] otherwise it's going to be a
[08:51] mess so the
[08:58] customer
[09:47] it's a two-part
[09:49] thing so we have this big array of
[09:51] invoices
[09:55] here we
[09:58] want
[10:28] wow
[10:40] oh yeah we want to populate um I think
[10:44] we can do that
[10:46] later yeah we're going to do the final
[10:48] step where we populate
[10:50] with stripe count
[10:56] data to finish with that
[11:19] so we got customer
[11:23] invoices so it's a promise for each
[11:27] customers we Reeve the invoices okay can
[11:32] remove that which I guess we will need
[11:35] to push the
[11:39] invoices yeah
[11:53] filter Oh no you're going to say
[11:56] push only paid
[11:59] invoices
[12:01] to the invoices
[12:09] are so we can remove
[12:18] that we don't need to do
[12:21] that we push all the invoices so that
[12:24] should be the same code and here we have
[12:26] to
[12:27] await uh
[12:30] wait so we
[12:36] have check out
[12:39] sessions sessions data that's
[12:44] fine
[12:53] wait
[12:57] okay
[13:12] we're going to do something
[13:14] export
[13:27] Reef
[13:47] here
[13:51] um we here we going to
[13:57] say all payment
[14:03] intent for the paid
[14:07] wait if the payment statute is
[14:09] paid yeah it's a bit tricky but I think
[14:12] that should
[14:15] work we get all the petition for each
[14:18] petition we retrieve the payment
[14:21] intent and if it's
[14:24] succeeded I don't think there will be an
[14:26] invoice here
[14:27] though there shouldn't be an
[14:32] invoice that's where we will have to do
[14:34] some
[14:37] magic I think we're going to console
[14:39] [Music]
[14:41] log pment intent and and we going to
[14:44] have to create manually that invoice
[14:46] that's the generation invoice generation
[14:47] part that we don't have yet I'm going to
[14:50] test if this thing is running probably
[14:53] won't I still get to give it a try
[14:56] um where did I must have no I didn't
[14:59] mess up anywhere
[15:02] okay three we need to
[15:08] populate
[15:13] each invoice with the stripe account
[15:22] data add the stripe account
[15:27] ID
[15:32] this
[15:32] [Music]
[15:34] should
[15:43] work at the end we Loop over inching
[15:46] noices and we add this thing okay let's
[15:48] yes this is never going to work but we
[15:51] have to try
[15:57] it see what bugs we going to get
[16:06] yep
[16:09] 403
[16:10] yep check out session read okay that's
[16:13] the restricted API key part we have to
[16:17] solve so we need to get this checkout
[16:19] session and I bet we'll need the
[16:22] payments um
[16:24] so where is that part
[16:27] uh
[16:31] try here we'll need to add this
[16:35] permission so yeah if you're tuning in
[16:37] right now and you're working with stripe
[16:39] for some reason um there is something
[16:42] new that's not very well documented in
[16:44] stripe but called the restricted API
[16:46] Keys which are API keys that gives you
[16:49] limited access to a STP account this is
[16:51] what I use for bu dispute and for Indie
[16:52] page so you avoid having security issues
[16:56] like you only get limited permission for
[16:58] for specific resources like you only
[17:00] want to read stripe um you know
[17:03] customers or you want to write stripe
[17:05] customers you want to add web books or
[17:07] not it gives you specific resource
[17:09] permissions and this is pretty sick so
[17:11] in this case I need to add this checkout
[17:14] session read permission to read the
[17:17] checkout and if you populate the URL
[17:20] here uh it's a long one but if you add
[17:22] those permission to the URL you can
[17:24] create a link that automatically adds
[17:27] the right API permissions you want to
[17:30] give to so now I added the checkout
[17:32] session and it should be added somewhere
[17:36] all checkout resources uh yeah checkout
[17:40] sessions here now I have if I create a
[17:42] key I'm going to have a read
[17:45] permission so let's create a key let's
[17:47] see how that works this is probably not
[17:48] going to work because we also need
[17:49] payment
[17:51] intent I'm going to copy past the key
[17:53] and add a new stripe account and it's
[17:55] not going to work because I already had
[17:58] this account so I have to delete which
[18:00] one is it this one this one
[18:04] yeah add the key again yep that was this
[18:12] one this is a this is the Live account I
[18:19] think wait one second before I leak all
[18:23] my stripe API
[18:26] Keys let's check real quick I did a mess
[18:30] up
[18:41] somewhere oh okay I think I know
[18:45] why okay
[18:47] apparently okay they would okay okay
[18:51] okay let back at it
[18:55] um yeah I had to delete all the SHP
[18:57] accounts and re add this one so now we
[18:59] have these accounts these test accounts
[19:03] and we are going to see if we can
[19:06] search actually no it was a really not
[19:10] smart idea to
[19:13] create Tron for this let me go
[19:18] back going to check uh to recreate an
[19:21] API key for Zenvo test
[19:27] accounts let's see how that goes so we
[19:30] have the key it should be
[19:32] here yeah the
[19:35] key restri key here we passed it and we
[19:39] add the account right there oh little
[19:42] error
[19:45] here oh yeah okay okay it's because we
[19:47] cannot create the logo because it's a
[19:50] test account for now but this would
[19:51] never happen on production so this is
[19:54] fine um going back to
[19:57] it
[19:59] we still have a permission can the
[20:00] property reading fine
[20:04] okay where are
[20:10] we find the successful payment intent so
[20:13] we
[20:14] have let's see what we get
[20:17] here oh maybe because we have no
[20:19] sessions maybe that would
[20:22] be there be why that could be the reason
[20:27] why
[20:29] let's
[20:33] see Miss object object
[20:36] object retrieve check
[20:44] out what do we get
[20:48] here what a
[20:57] return
[21:00] cons log
[21:18] again isuse the data session
[21:25] R I have no idea what I'm looking
[21:36] at okay we do have
[21:47] something it's an
[21:52] array okay so we're supposed to get an
[21:54] ARR oh okay I think it oh it's because
[21:56] I'm probably looping over few account
[22:26] okay
[22:30] Dan Dan 6
[22:39] boy doesn't stripe handle the invoice
[22:42] generation and automatically email a
[22:44] copy to the user's email it emails a
[22:47] receipt for successful payments but it
[22:49] does not email the invoice and mostly
[22:52] European people need invoices which
[22:54] means a paper that says that has is
[22:58] written in big invoice at the top left
[23:01] and I think there are a few more
[23:02] information on it and on top of that
[23:05] sometimes there is no when you check out
[23:08] on stripe you don't input your invoice
[23:11] your business details like your tax ID
[23:13] for instance and so you get an invoice
[23:15] without it and for again probably mostly
[23:17] Europeans if you don't have this um your
[23:20] accountant might not be very happy and
[23:22] so most of my uh online businesses when
[23:27] I get support is about invoice like can
[23:29] I get the invoice can I edit the invoice
[23:32] and usually they want to edit to add
[23:33] their business details or because they
[23:35] made a typo in their name or their
[23:37] business
[23:41] names
[23:52] he damn I'm lost uh
[23:56] promise
[24:00] each strip
[24:01] [Music]
[24:07] counts we retrieve the session and we l
[24:10] that little thing
[24:17] here don't even know what I'm reading
[24:21] now what is
[24:26] that
[24:30] [Â __Â ] is
[24:39] that think I might have [Â __Â ] up
[24:56] somewhere
[25:07] oh
[25:26] boy
[25:38] I'm I'm going to get rid of the promise
[25:39] at
[25:41] all think this is a little bit [Â __Â ]
[25:43] up my mind CU
[25:47] I
[25:52] yep custom for each message only use a
[25:56] for anding L for
[26:18] Loop we got something
[26:21] here okay I'm going to get rid of that
[26:26] thing
[26:32] up wrong
[26:44] ones have no clue what I'm
[26:50] doing okay this is
[26:54] better we retrieve the
[27:00] we get the token account we retrieve the
[27:02] customer same here for each
[27:18] customers
[27:25] S no no no
[27:28] no no no no
[27:30] or thank
[27:33] you ret invoice access toen customer ID
[27:36] this is it and we push that
[27:43] thing invoice in
[27:46] okay so that is how we get the invoice
[27:50] under the email
[27:51] okay going
[27:53] to check out making sure that this is
[27:56] working
[28:01] from Bordeaux
[28:07] yo shouldn't you end the customer email
[28:10] to verify their own email they click the
[28:13] link in the email to receive the invoice
[28:15] what St from pulling other people's
[28:17] invoice um the way it's built for
[28:22] now there is no way for I mean you can
[28:26] actually search for other people emails
[28:28] that implies that you have the unique uh
[28:31] link that's been given to the business
[28:33] and you also know the customers emails
[28:35] of that business which is a pretty heavy
[28:38] thing already later on if that's a
[28:42] concerned like if there if I get some
[28:43] user concerns about that I probably want
[28:45] to uh I make some like kind of unique
[28:48] links only for specific people I see but
[28:51] for
[28:51] now I'll stick with uh that that thing
[28:56] here
[28:59] okay we get the invoices okay so this
[29:01] piece of code is still
[29:06] working count an extra and normally
[29:10] here we still got the business name
[29:14] okay now I need to find okay so let's
[29:17] get back to
[29:22] this we retrieve all the checkout
[29:24] sessions and we are going to conso log
[29:26] those sessions to see what is going
[29:37] on wait actually I'm going to
[29:40] be um ban from stripe if I keep pulling
[29:44] the API just this way so I'm going to
[29:47] remove that piece of code and just do
[29:49] one by
[29:56] one
[29:58] what do we get
[30:01] here you know what I'm going to be a
[30:03] good developer and I'm going to read the
[30:05] stripe documentation for good uh stri
[30:09] API check out list instead of going uh
[30:14] like that so we have the strap checkout
[30:18] list with status complete and we put the
[30:21] customer
[30:22] email and we are supposed to get back an
[30:25] object with data which
[30:28] normally return
[30:36] sessions theeta right yeah we're
[30:40] supposed to get these
[30:43] back if it matches the customer so just
[30:46] to be sure customer
[30:47] details customer details. email sure yep
[30:52] and Status complete complete yeah we
[30:55] only want to return the complete on okay
[30:59] so here we get back an array
[31:07] normally why do we get back three arrays
[31:10] that's the
[31:13] question CU we have only oh no we do
[31:16] have two
[31:24] accounts it's e equal Z
[31:30] also going to
[31:35] do plus I'm going console
[31:44] log extra I think how did I save that
[31:49] models extra. name I think it
[31:54] is it's probably going to be no I think
[31:56] it's going to be
[31:57] be yeah it's not going to it's not yeah
[31:59] it's not going to be populated because
[32:01] it's a test mode I'm going to log the
[32:03] cons the account ID
[32:06] though. account ID let's give it a
[32:11] try okay we have zero first account and
[32:15] we get an
[32:26] array
[32:27] here we get those sessions
[32:32] back so those
[32:34] are we get those are those objects
[32:38] normally which are supposed to have a
[32:42] payment intent
[32:44] somewhere inted here what does the
[32:47] documentation says about it I guess
[32:50] should go here how do we call it again
[32:54] we call
[32:56] them liit intense here Expendable oh
[33:01] that could be interesting to expand so
[33:04] we don't bother quering two times IDE of
[33:06] the payment
[33:10] intent
[33:14] okay the ID of the payment in for
[33:17] session and we can expend
[33:20] it how do we expand again oh yeah
[33:23] retrieve and we pass this parameter okay
[33:28] that could be a
[33:31] good thing so retrieve blah blah
[33:34] [Music]
[33:36] blah TR check out
[33:41] charger is it going to work if we list
[33:44] the
[33:45] more many
[33:52] object all API request and applies to
[33:56] the reponse
[33:58] place to the rep request
[34:09] only all right let's
[34:11] see if we pass this thing uh and we say
[34:15] expend payment
[34:17] Intent no you don't want to save
[34:22] [Music]
[34:25] me here we go
[34:28] see what we get from
[34:29] that might have to console
[34:33] log I think the first
[34:38] one I didn't
[34:42] see
[34:45] NOP unone arguments okay I think I
[34:48] didn't call this session the right
[34:55] way
[35:10] you give me some details here stripe
[35:11] another arguments object object did you
[35:13] mean to pass an option object Yep this
[35:15] is what I'm trying to
[35:17] do let's see what it
[35:25] says
[35:27] least for method where all arguments are
[35:31] optional you should simply pass them all
[35:34] in
[35:39] the
[35:40] okay so you're saying that I should be
[35:43] doing this
[35:47] or you don't read correctly let's
[35:55] see that this is a different
[36:02] error oh you want to try expanding data
[36:06] that intent
[36:08] instead
[36:14] okay it's a tricky
[36:17] one TR it again okay we have
[36:22] something we have been able
[36:24] to so we are look the first session
[36:27] right now how does it
[36:30] look okay we are looking for
[36:34] each give me one second I think there is
[36:36] a little someone delivering a little
[36:39] packet to my
[36:55] door
[37:24] that was indeed a good check delivery
[37:27] we're
[37:30] back so we get de s um is the
[37:35] payment intent okay it is expended which
[37:38] is
[37:41] [Music]
[37:51] good for
[37:55] each
[38:06] each for each for
[38:08] each
[38:11] um all right this is the part where we
[38:14] have to get the right data where is
[38:22] it UI
[38:25] hosted
[38:50] let St
[38:55] this
[38:57] okay this is it um here we are going to
[39:00] go
[39:01] [Music]
[39:07] over
[39:13] each for each
[39:25] session
[39:30] that's where
[39:36] payments intent
[39:39] is
[39:43] succeeded
[39:48] is create an invoice
[39:53] object with the following
[39:56] [Music]
[39:59] parameters properties okay I can remove
[40:03] all
[40:08] that and here we want to
[40:14] add what what are we going to do so we
[40:16] need an invoice I
[40:18] guess number so this will not exist
[40:23] but we will find something else
[40:29] can we get the receip maybe we can get
[40:30] the
[40:31] receipt CU that I think yeah that should
[40:34] be provided on every checkout but I
[40:36] don't know if there
[40:37] is a re no there is no
[40:41] receip right we're going to have to find
[40:43] a workout work around workout already
[40:46] [Music]
[40:48] done
[40:53] um what do we have here
[41:06] for
[41:07] each for each
[41:11] out we want need to populate all that so
[41:14] we will need invoice
[41:17] ID
[41:19] um see let's go back to the invoice API
[41:23] inst
[41:24] strip which is
[41:28] is it is not a core resource and where
[41:32] this invoice there we
[41:36] go me the invoice object if you you
[41:41] mind are
[41:47] you oh yeah there so ID nope
[41:55] um
[41:57] well actually I'm going to go to the
[41:58] invoice page and see what information we
[42:13] need way too many tabs
[42:22] open we
[42:24] need strip name okay the
[42:29] currency we get the currency somewhere
[42:31] okay maybe the co-pilot will do it for
[42:33] US
[42:36] currency is we need the amount paid as
[42:39] well yes the status will be paid for
[42:43] sure the invoice number we can still put
[42:47] it
[42:51] status
[42:55] created
[43:00] created the
[43:03] time
[43:05] of the
[43:12] payments is that it no I think we need
[43:15] to have an
[43:16] [Music]
[43:18] entire uh there's probably something I
[43:20] don't see here where is it the products
[43:23] page invo sters yeah okay cuz I'm not
[43:26] seeing the right thing here
[43:29] y created due date
[43:33] um do we have those information in the
[43:45] checkout I don't believe there would be
[43:47] any kind of due
[43:55] date
[44:02] status Ural St
[44:14] URL need currency conversion custom text
[44:17] what
[44:18] else and
[44:21] invoice idea of the invoice creit if it
[44:24] exists yeah if it exists that's the
[44:25] problem
[44:42] in
[44:46] um going to try with very minimum data
[44:49] first and see if I get
[44:51] something that's at least that's working
[44:55] uh the due date I think we're going to
[44:56] say
[45:02] that
[45:04] oops okay I cannot type on my keyboard
[45:08] anymore some of the
[45:10] payments what else do we have account
[45:16] name that we should get it from the
[45:22] business think it's STP account model
[45:26] extra and name
[45:32] yep so here just in case we don't have
[45:35] it I'm going to say strip account name
[45:38] um okay that's
[45:40] working customer details yeah we're
[45:44] going to fill that
[45:51] in so we can do that for later think
[45:55] what's important is we have the business
[45:57] owner name we need the customer
[46:06] information yeah
[46:10] so where is it this part here will be
[46:14] important customer name what do we have
[46:17] here on the
[46:24] checkout recation custom customer
[46:27] creation customer details this is
[46:30] it okay there we go
[46:36] um oh we also need to make sure
[46:41] that the
[46:43] type
[46:45] is
[46:47] liement intent
[46:50] yep actually no I'm going to say
[46:52] checkout it's going to be shorter
[46:54] sweeter
[46:56] to
[46:57] date here we want
[47:00] customer we format that
[47:04] here invoice to
[47:06] edit customer
[47:16] name which we should get
[47:18] here customer address and customer
[47:24] email
[47:31] cute going to give it this a try and see
[47:33] where it
[47:42] goes you don't need to retrieve those
[47:45] because I already have them so if
[47:48] payment
[47:49] intent status that
[47:52] succeeded we already have the payment
[47:54] intent
[48:05] I think we are
[48:08] getting intent what's the name of
[48:24] it it is here payment
[48:30] intent
[48:33] this we get this from the
[48:36] session and we
[48:39] should provide them here right I hope I
[48:42] have no idea if this is going to
[48:44] work going to try to see if we get a
[48:47] little something working and if it does
[48:48] then I will just keep iterating until I
[48:50] have all the data needed for the
[48:54] invoice so let's get back to it search
[48:58] for that What er oh no okay this is not
[49:03] terrible oh well this is even it
[49:05] populates a little bit oh wow that's
[49:11] cool I think yeah just
[49:14] from let me think oh no actually I don't
[49:17] even search for so those are all
[49:20] checkout session
[49:22] that
[49:24] that were successful I guess yeah
[49:27] payment int succeeded y
[49:31] yeah oh this is
[49:33] sick maybe we can double check that
[49:43] uh some on stripe no okay I guess I'm
[49:46] going to have to use the sidebar
[49:54] um
[49:56] when were they made 2024 so this is
[49:59] probably
[50:06] 2024 2024 is it the correct date it
[50:11] looks like
[50:15] it yeah of course there's something
[50:17] missing
[50:24] here
[50:27] maybe I can do something here I can
[50:29] probably in this
[50:33] page here in the
[50:40] business here I think if it doesn't have
[50:43] the name I'll give it
[50:46] the
[50:54] think
[50:59] ins back all the invoices I think oh
[51:01] yeah I need to edit that inv those trap
[51:12] accounts here we
[51:16] go in
[51:22] here is it working oh no it's not the
[51:25] IDE no no this is not what I wanted it's
[51:27] the TR how did I call
[51:30] that naming is the hardest thing in Pro
[51:32] in programming this
[51:35] say count ID
[51:41] okay let's get it back to it okay so we
[51:44] have few okay this is under these
[51:48] accounts
[51:53] which okay so those are all all made I
[51:56] delete this one so we remove
[52:01] confusion okay oh yeah that makes sense
[52:03] okay those are yeah it's clear Mark wake
[52:06] up this is right here this is the exact
[52:08] same data that you have
[52:10] here boy
[52:13] okay uh probably want to organize those
[52:16] invoices by created time I
[52:19] guess invoices
[52:22] um s the invoices man Copilot I love
[52:27] you so I'm going to refresh it should be
[52:30] 1999 494949 okay and now how does it say
[52:35] okay it's a bit messed up get back to
[52:39] it
[52:41] 1919 and one is missing why would this
[52:45] be
[52:48] missing intent oh because it's a
[52:50] different email okay so the system is
[52:54] working
[52:58] right I'll do this one so stripe doesn't
[53:01] kill
[53:06] me okay
[53:11] uh okay so I'm going to do here uh the
[53:14] download button I think I'm going to
[53:16] hide
[53:19] it I'm going to say something like
[53:24] um download invoice invoice. invoice
[53:37] PDF I hit this
[53:42] button oh wait actually I know the code
[53:44] invoice um if invoice oops invo PDF
[53:50] and weide buttons download
[53:54] buttons
[53:59] if oh yeah because
[54:08] um and then
[54:10] here we're going to say something
[54:13] like not going to be edit is going to
[54:17] be invoice PDF
[54:21] and
[54:23] edit or
[54:31] else we going to have
[54:35] a
[54:37] view we are going to tell tell hero icon
[54:40] and we're going to say little I
[54:43] here this
[54:46] I which one should we go this one I Min
[54:54] one
[54:56] that's a massive icon the micro
[55:04] one okay okay this is still broken and
[55:07] this is perfectly
[55:13] normal there we go
[55:17] View and then now we need to make sure
[55:21] we have all the data to
[55:24] provide
[55:34] do we have here so let check out
[55:36] currency USD yeah we will probably
[55:42] need we will I think yeah we'll need to
[55:45] know where what the customer purchased
[55:48] so there should be somewhere in a
[55:51] checkout session where we have the
[55:52] product
[55:54] data
[55:55] hey Mark hey yo Robin o is is not
[56:00] allowing anything of the total or dates
[56:02] of anything yeah the editing part for
[56:04] the invoices is just for customer name
[56:07] name um email and they can add some
[56:11] information about them like V8 numbers
[56:13] for
[56:17] [Music]
[56:23] instance
[56:40] hello boy I'm supposed to have a dinner
[56:42] tonight I think I'm going
[56:45] to be washed by the
[56:52] rain the lines that make have the
[56:55] invoice I think this is it lines object
[57:00] data and this is it this is all we
[57:04] need um okay and what is the difference
[57:07] with no actually no no stupid Mark no oh
[57:11] damn it would have been too
[57:13] easy
[57:15] uh oh actually this line items this is
[57:18] exactly the
[57:19] same oh if that's the case that it's
[57:21] going to be so much simpler ID object
[57:23] amount discount no ID object amount we
[57:27] get something similar here okay so I
[57:29] need to expand line
[57:31] items so I know what is the customer
[57:33] actually
[57:35] purchasing going back to the API and
[57:40] here in
[57:42] the stripe Library we need to extend as
[57:45] well the nine
[57:47] [Music]
[57:51] items is that working okay now give it a
[57:54] try
[57:59] so I think let me
[58:05] see the
[58:07] [Music]
[58:09] data I'm going to have to give it
[58:23] lines
[58:26] session lines item okay let's see what
[58:28] we get
[58:32] here
[58:38] yo API key issue
[58:41] NOP I cannot expend that these property
[58:45] cannot be expended you may try to expend
[58:47] it yes again the same mistake I did of
[58:51] course boy data doline items
[58:55] and now I might get a
[58:57] 403 no I didn't I didn't okay we have
[59:00] the permissions
[59:03] nice
[59:04] L self served invoices Bingo this is
[59:11] it let's see might be too ambitious yes
[59:14] of
[59:16] course soon soon soon
[59:21] um actually he should be there no
[59:32] LS
[59:34] oh okay okay okay I just need I don't
[59:36] need to add data
[59:39] here I'm going try
[59:47] it reading
[59:53] zero yeah
[60:01] we hey Google wake me up at 5:30
[60:12] p.m. what is there
[60:15] where
[60:21] 41 Dam Google is TR is thinking that I'm
[60:24] talking to
[60:27] custom Tex ID there we
[60:31] go know rep property of reading zero
[60:53] oh
[60:58] maybe I just do
[61:08] this
[61:12] okay
[61:14] yal that is one step okay it's not done
[61:19] but it's a step forward we have the bill
[61:23] address right we need to get this
[61:25] information self services oh boy
[61:28] yes okay it's I think it's just a matter
[61:31] of finding the amount I probably don't
[61:33] return the amounts somewhere I could
[61:36] that
[61:36] [Music]
[61:43] be how does he get
[61:46] that how do you know customer
[61:52] address oh
[62:02] customer name
[62:05] customer I
[62:12] do email session
[62:22] created okay no that makes sense okay
[62:24] that is working okay okay okay I'm
[62:27] surprised that the co-pilot being so
[62:29] good that I I don't I wouldn't even
[62:31] expect it to work I guess I cannot
[62:34] complain in that
[62:36] case um we need the amount the amount
[62:39] amount amount I think it's called oh
[62:42] amount
[62:46] paid payment amount received this is
[62:50] actually here
[62:50] [Music]
[62:52] no or maybe it's because the amount okay
[62:54] we need to find the amount that's been
[62:56] received from the payment intent
[63:01] so intent yep we're going to check that
[63:05] real
[63:06] quick maybe we get it from the checkout
[63:09] no I don't think
[63:10] so well
[63:15] maybe there doesn't seem to be an amount
[63:18] oh amount
[63:20] total total of all item after
[63:22] discounting and tax are applied but I
[63:24] think we need yeah we still need to get
[63:26] the payments
[63:27] intent
[63:29] thing because it might be more details
[63:32] and we need to only get the amount that
[63:33] has been
[63:37] paid which is called amount amount
[63:41] internet to be
[63:42] collected
[63:44] okay I was expecting more
[63:50] things oh yeah okay amount
[63:53] received
[63:55] amount received apparently here is
[63:57] null or maybe I did a mistake no it's
[64:00] not
[64:01] null okay I made another mistake
[64:03] somewhere this is actually
[64:06] good why you're not
[64:08] showing amount
[64:11] here let's get back to it
[64:20] do two amounts of
[64:23] course
[64:24] amount off NOP that's not the one amount
[64:27] due amount
[64:29] paid oh in our case this is the same
[64:32] amount cuz if the payment is succeeded
[64:35] the amount
[64:39] due Maybe not maybe actually not so
[64:42] let's
[64:46] see amount
[64:48] details there we
[64:52] go should the am you can tip in strip
[64:56] payments I didn't know that amount
[64:59] capturable amount that can be captured
[65:01] no amount received that's probably
[65:04] it
[65:06] created oh maybe we get the amount paid
[65:09] okay I think we get the amount paid from
[65:11] the
[65:12] payments yeah this is for sure and we
[65:15] also need amount
[65:23] due
[65:26] the total amount for the payments please
[65:29] give me some magic
[65:34] trt that's it
[65:39] no amount internet okay okay so this is
[65:42] probably the amount that's due
[65:46] here let's refresh see where we
[65:51] go May no
[65:55] what do we get
[66:03] here amount due amounts
[66:07] paid uh yep there should be a little
[66:10] something
[66:16] here invoice. amount
[66:22] paid do
[66:27] invoice to
[66:29] edit
[66:30] currency the
[66:32] currency is right but the amount is not
[66:36] although we get amount due
[66:39] here maybe let's try another invoice see
[66:42] what we
[66:43] get okay this is working for this one
[66:45] but not for the first one oh maybe I
[66:48] didn't refresh properly do it
[66:51] looks oh boy okay this is working
[66:54] working now uh not everywhere
[66:59] though oh cuz okay that's probably the
[67:02] different
[67:02] [Music]
[67:06] amount let's
[67:10] see not a
[67:13] number let's see what we got for the sub
[67:17] total oh there's a sub total oh okay
[67:19] okay okay
[67:21] okay okay why wouldn't
[67:24] the sub
[67:38] total oh
[67:41] yeah so happy I have G co-pilot for that
[67:44] it literally go through the stripe
[67:46] documentation and it
[67:48] knows why some things and why they're
[67:52] not
[67:55] I love
[67:56] it um okay we didn't have any discount
[67:59] for this one so we'll probably have to
[68:02] find yeah inv to discounts
[68:10] here
[68:12] this
[68:16] discount total amount of the discounts
[68:19] yep
[68:21] an an object
[68:30] property and we also have the total
[68:35] which should be here yeah
[68:46] total let's see what cellet will do for
[68:50] this session amount sub
[68:52] total really
[68:55] I down it that'll be
[68:57] so oh [Â __Â ] oh yes so
[69:02] good
[69:04] okay I just Sav myself a little bit of a
[69:07] headache here and samey has the discount
[69:09] so it's actually all the
[69:11] same I don't know why they charge this
[69:14] much for invoices I don't get it might
[69:17] be missing something out
[69:20] here is this discount part
[69:26] it's probably after discount discount
[69:31] discount how do I know the discount
[69:36] is where is it on the invoice
[69:39] part it
[69:41] is probably below below
[69:47] below discounts
[69:52] okay
[69:55] how do we get the discount for a
[69:58] checkout there should be something
[69:59] somewhere I need to find
[70:08] it after discount be
[70:10] applied come on Mr check out you might
[70:15] be the can't the discount can be missing
[70:18] like
[70:21] this go no no

[70:48] go amount and
[70:51] discount we have here
[70:54] discount that
[70:59] coupon what is that coupon
[71:17] thing
[71:19] okay hash describing we won't get this
[71:22] information unfortunately
[71:29] hash describing the coupon
[71:46] okay brain is fried hello boys love the
[71:49] font and the design did you make it
[71:52] thank you Carlos uh yes yes I did make
[71:55] it although I get heavily inspired by um
[71:58] everything I see on the internet I'm
[72:00] actually reusing one of my other
[72:03] websites design called by dispute the
[72:07] font is
[72:09] gabarito and I use Daisy UI as a library
[72:12] for UI
[72:14] components and I just swap the the color
[72:18] from blue to green feels like more uh
[72:22] Zen because the name of the app is Zen
[72:27] voice do you speak French send the twi
[72:38] uh first
[72:40] Twitter uh the twitch link um if you
[72:43] guys want the twitch link just in
[72:51] case no clue
[72:54] I know there is something broadcasting
[72:56] on my twitch
[73:00] sorry um I am not a twitch person so I
[73:03] don't even know how to share link
[73:04] probably here yet here there you
[73:08] go uh I will add the link on Twitter uh
[73:12] again if you guys are coming from
[73:13] Twitter you might want to use either the
[73:15] twitch or the YouTube link because
[73:18] Twitter is very bad for broadcasting
[73:21] videos or if you're a
[73:26] twitch
[73:33] Ty there we
[73:36] go is it yep it was supp it
[73:40] okay
[73:42] um so going back to that
[73:50] thing hello Mark hello Zafar
[74:13] so we need to figure out the discount
[74:14] thing which is not very clear for now we
[74:18] have the customer data that is good we
[74:20] need to have a due date yeah I'm going
[74:22] to do the due date cuz I think this is
[74:23] quite
[74:24] important do
[74:29] date you are dated
[74:40] you voice TW it created you are not
[74:43] showing the created part
[74:48] no do
[74:51] date why are you not showing anything
[74:53] thing
[75:01] here oh okay it's because one part is
[75:04] missing okay those are actually correct
[75:08] we need the invoice
[75:11] number because the invoice doesn't exist
[75:14] maybe we can make it up or we give it
[75:17] probably yeah probably going to give
[75:19] it invoice
[75:21] number format
[75:28] this
[75:37] your how does Tri format their
[75:41] invoices
[75:44] um Tri invoice
[75:51] format here we here we got an invoice
[75:56] here it looks like a number that is
[75:59] being increased and here what is that
[76:12] thing how could I get
[76:15] the the invoice does not or no I create
[76:19] an
[76:22] invoice actually create an invoice
[76:31] and actually maybe that could be
[76:35] it maybe we need to create that
[76:40] invoice oh yeah
[76:42] but oh okay we shouldn't create the
[76:44] invoice because because because because
[76:46] it's never going to be in the right
[76:49] format yeah cuz I think you need to
[76:52] charge
[76:53] in the collection method charge b or
[76:56] send invoice yeah you okay you cannot
[76:58] create invoices after you've paid okay
[77:00] yeah yeah that is not a smart move
[77:04] here advance customer description
[77:13] metadata
[77:17] voice can you eventually give me a
[77:19] little detail about the voice tribe
[77:30] the name of the invoice number I think
[77:33] it's should be
[77:40] called right anyway doesn't matter I
[77:42] think we need to format the
[77:47] invoice it should be it should be a
[77:49] format based on an information that that
[77:53] will never
[77:55] change
[78:00] so
[78:12] um right we can try this we have
[78:15] something to show first and then we'll
[78:17] see how to make it
[78:20] uh refresh that
[78:26] oh maybe it's not called number how did
[78:28] it call that invoice
[78:32] number it is it is
[78:36] number what did I do
[78:38] here oh yeah it's
[78:45] here it another
[78:51] TR
[78:55] okay we have the checkout
[78:59] session
[79:00] way so that we have a beautiful
[79:03] formating for that
[79:10] um I'll be back in a
[79:21] minute
[80:17] hey welcome back to the
[80:21] Stream um so we need to create a format
[80:25] for the invoice That's
[80:39] Unique I'll actually
[80:50] create just have to make sure it is
[80:52] unique so
[81:02] so a
[81:05] unique for the
[81:13] invoice let's see what we get from geub
[81:17] copilot come on give me something
[81:21] man
[81:27] should
[81:31] be unique an
[81:34] integer of eight
[81:39] characters yeah trying stuff here it
[81:43] might break everything
[81:47] nope it
[81:50] must I'm using capital letter so uh it
[81:54] is actually
[81:56] working that's is it if you want a fix
[81:59] for your GitHub copilot just use capital
[82:03] letters it is
[82:13] Magic maybe it must
[82:15] be maybe we can take the last eight
[82:20] characters the last eight
[82:24] characters of the sis 80 and there we go
[82:27] that should be
[82:50] good all right that looks good invoice
[82:53] number uh maybe we capitalize
[82:58] them it's an
[83:18] ID push
[83:21] that
[83:25] okay um should check out a real strip
[83:30] invoice to make sure that we are somehow
[83:33] consistent with the
[83:36] thing is it a stripe invoice nope it is
[83:40] not this is
[83:42] one all right this looks like could be
[83:50] legit okay let work it it's working um
[83:55] what else do we have we have the coupon
[83:57] coupon
[83:59] things take same
[84:04] characters um you
[84:07] Bill okay the line item is not right and
[84:11] the coupon probably will not be right
[84:14] otherwise the rest look really
[84:16] neat for line items
[84:19] um this is that thing here and we
[84:26] have dot map the data so description
[84:29] quantity okay we might want to add a
[84:31] text
[84:35] somewhere here
[84:41] is I'm trying something absolutely
[84:43] random no it's not going to work of
[84:45] course invoice currency
[84:48] okay line about unit amount amount and
[84:52] amount
[84:54] so is that yeah
[85:00] amounts I think in the case
[85:05] of unit
[85:10] price this is not the discount it
[85:15] is quantity the the quantity of prob why
[85:19] do
[85:20] you unit amount and quantity come on you
[85:23] could have
[85:25] used line price. unique amount and here
[85:28] it's called quantity
[85:38] oh where wait where am I missing up no
[85:41] this is the line oh line amount
[85:44] okay
[85:50] okay okay so in in that case it should
[85:53] be amounts
[86:03] total unit price amount okay so I [Â __Â ]
[86:06] up somewhere price unit
[86:08] [Music]
[86:12] amount oh because there was a discount
[86:14] oh yeah
[86:16] yeah oh okay yeah I'm I'm missing
[86:21] okay
[86:23] Ser
[86:26] invoices oh yeah because I think the
[86:28] price
[86:29] it's let's check normally it's 49 and
[86:32] it's discounted at
[86:34] 19
[86:35] yeah okay so I should have the discount
[86:43] somewhere
[86:48] okay how do you
[86:51] sure
[86:53] does it work how how is is it supposed
[86:55] to be displayed on the invoice maybe I
[86:56] can check in the customers part for some
[87:00] payments that have were already made
[87:02] Let's
[87:04] see we can see this one and see if we
[87:07] get an invoice for Mr
[87:12] Mark invoice
[87:15] here are you up there
[87:21] somewhere
[87:23] I did not oh yeah yeah okay I'm using
[87:26] yeah I'm checking this one should be
[87:35] it it's made only one invoice
[87:40] though let me try to make an invoice
[87:43] manually
[87:48] [Music]
[87:49] then you're supposed to know the price
[87:51] now
[87:56] what are you
[88:20] doing why there is no there are no
[88:22] invoices for
[88:33] this is it because I
[88:43] made let's go back to the customers
[88:45] let's see this
[88:47] one this little boy here doesn't have
[88:49] any
[88:50] invoice and are here as a guest doesn't
[88:55] have any invoice of
[89:08] course still
[89:15] not I'll try to make
[89:18] a re checkout I'll try to make a payment
[89:22] with a discount so I'm going to
[89:26] remove from the strip checkout session
[89:29] where is
[89:33] it okay I want to create that invoice
[89:35] and I am going to make a
[89:41] payment yeah actually I'm going to do
[89:44] that in incognit mode so I don't have my
[89:47] email and I create a new
[89:50] customer
[89:56] test a
[90:12] discount okay let's go back to
[90:15] it we have this new guy here that made a
[90:19] payment with an invoice that has a
[90:22] discount
[90:23] somewhere so let's see how the invoice
[90:26] looks
[90:31] like it's not the
[90:33] invoice this is the
[90:38] one okay so the discount is applied
[90:45] after okay it doesn't show any discount
[90:47] anywhere okay that makes sense so here
[90:50] in my invoice page
[90:52] I should show here
[90:57] uh
[90:58] amount in
[91:01] amount it is the amount before the
[91:04] discount
[91:06] so in the session object uh yeah session
[91:11] amount
[91:13] total
[91:15] no
[91:16] oops line amount discount total discount
[91:20] applied
[91:22] total before discount or tanks being
[91:25] applied total after discount and tax oh
[91:29] see before any discount okay that's the
[91:32] yeah that's the amount which should be
[91:35] the exact amount that's here
[91:38] and there's the line
[91:42] thing lines and here we want to see the
[91:47] amount amount in
[91:49] sense so yeah I'm showing the I'm
[91:51] showing the amount before discounts and
[91:55] taxes and so we have the exact same
[91:57] thing here and it would change only it's
[91:59] only if the quantity changes that we the
[92:01] amount will
[92:01] change so I guess if the customer
[92:05] purchased two times this it should show
[92:07] double here then we have the discount we
[92:10] have the
[92:11] subtotal and then we should have a line
[92:13] that says
[92:14] discount so to calculate the discounts
[92:17] because we're not
[92:20] using an
[92:22] invoice thing we are going to have to
[92:31] use okay for the here this is the part
[92:34] we have to do discounts and we have to
[92:36] create coupon. amount
[92:43] off okay we have to calculate for each
[92:46] Lin's item what is we have to create
[92:49] something discount coupon amount of okay
[92:56] see test to be like
[92:59] coupon
[93:01] amount off oh boy this is no no there's
[93:05] no way this is
[93:09] working that'll be a
[93:12] dream let's refresh and see what we
[93:17] get get all the invoices okay this is
[93:20] correct
[93:24] yeah boy this is actually
[93:32] working
[93:41] holy wait actually what am I doing here
[93:44] what are you doing
[93:47] Mark I'm losing my
[93:50] math let's give me one more
[93:56] try yeah boy
[93:59] okay
[94:02] beautiful there it is we are able to
[94:04] generate
[94:05] stripe invoices after the payment is
[94:09] being
[94:10] made it is
[94:17] beautiful let's give it one more try so
[94:19] I go to this page
[94:23] I am a strike business owner and I did
[94:26] not activate the payment with the postp
[94:29] purchase
[94:30] invoices which cost
[94:33] 0.4% my
[94:36] customer let's say let's take a fresh
[94:39] new customer this guy this customer just
[94:41] made a payments oh no no no we need okay
[94:44] we need to make a proper test
[94:46] so I want to get the product not going
[94:49] to generate the invoice automatically
[94:51] because it costs
[94:53] money this customer this way
[94:58] okay
[95:00] bingo I pay the
[95:06] product in my stripe dashboard I can see
[95:08] that this customer has been created and
[95:11] there is no invoice that's been
[95:13] generated
[95:15] stop there's no invoice that's been
[95:17] generated for this customer so I did not
[95:19] pay the extra 0.4% to stripe
[95:22] but if I go here if I type the customer
[95:25] invoice I am supposed to get something
[95:29] and this is it invoice here I view the
[95:35] invoice I see that I have the time is
[95:38] been purchased I have the customer data
[95:40] that are being here displayed
[95:42] here the unit price the amount per units
[95:46] the discount that was applied and the
[95:48] amount that was due and we have a
[95:50] beautiful invoice that is actually
[95:53] working this is nice I think it's a nice
[95:56] way to end the stream let's see if we uh
[96:00] this is not
[96:01] broken yeah this is per of me I should
[96:05] stop congratulating myself
[96:08] but oh boy
[96:10] okay well I'm going to commit that
[96:15] thing I didn't [Â __Â ] up anywhere yet this
[96:19] okay yeah this make sense this we don't
[96:22] really oh no no no I know where I should
[96:26] have find the code
[96:28] here this we can
[96:34] remove in here this
[96:37] part we should still and after we'll
[96:39] okay we'll need to
[96:44] filter here we need to filter
[96:50] um
[96:54] ID I think
[96:56] remove
[97:02] duplicate okay I'm going to keep the um
[97:04] I'm I'm not going to do that right now
[97:07] going to commit that
[97:19] thing okay
[97:24] and I'm going to go back to the API
[97:27] round was get
[97:29] invoice and we're going to pass this I
[97:32] have a little message here so tomorrow I
[97:35] can check this out and check if the code
[97:38] is actually
[97:40] working just out of curiosity I'm going
[97:42] to do a test live see how many things
[97:43] I'm going to
[97:47] break he hey looks like it's actually
[97:50] working
[97:51] boy I think it's
[97:53] working okay we'll need to test this
[97:56] tomorrow all right I think that's a wrap
[97:58] for today uh let's see where we
[98:02] are okay this is it um so I think I need
[98:07] to make a couple of edits to test some
[98:09] use cases for the product making sure
[98:11] that it works in all cases um but it
[98:14] looks like it's actually
[98:17] working um I'm not going to be live
[98:20] streaming this weekend I'm trying to
[98:21] make some videos on YouTube where I
[98:23] share what I've learned on my channel
[98:26] and so if you guys are curious you can
[98:27] check them out I will be posting one
[98:29] video per week and I've already started
[98:31] for the last three weeks and uh and
[98:34] hopefully you guys like it if you have
[98:36] any suggestions for the videos and all
[98:37] that I would love to hear what you uh
[98:39] want to watch um this is pretty much the
[98:42] end so the next part for this stream I
[98:44] think I'll do one more live about
[98:45] finishing the product publishing a few
[98:47] stuff testing and breaking stuff and
[98:49] then I'll will be building the landing
[98:50] page so we have the copy already that is
[98:53] uh what that was made yesterday we need
[98:55] to update a little bit the copy and
[98:56] create all the landing page components
[98:58] sections and all that um we have a user
[99:01] login we have a pig wall so we have
[99:03] pretty much everything that's ready um
[99:05] and then the next step I don't know if
[99:07] that's worth sharing live but you know I
[99:10] could share the product hunt launch uh
[99:12] launching on hiker news launching on on
[99:14] reddits um that could actually be fun if
[99:16] you guys want to tune in uh eventually
[99:19] we could do something like that
[99:21] um I I have to run have a little dinner
[99:23] tonight with friends I'm not going to be
[99:25] able to take on many
[99:27] questions um and but I'll be happy to do
[99:30] that next time um and with that being
[99:34] said I wish you all a very happy and
[99:36] good weekend and I'll see you in the
[99:39] next stream
[99:41] cheers
