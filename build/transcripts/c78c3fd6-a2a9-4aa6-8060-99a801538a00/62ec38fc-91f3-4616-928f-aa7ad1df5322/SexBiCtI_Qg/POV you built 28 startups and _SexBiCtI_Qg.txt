[00:00] Do more crazy things and it will pay off
[00:03] your failures. Now we're in my milk
[00:07] inspector.
[00:11] We're looking for a new home. And this
[00:13] is a proper pet
[00:15] every single day. It took another 7
[00:17] months to make second million. And now
[00:19] it's your turn off evil.
[00:29] [Music]
[00:41] [Music]
[00:44] never work out.
[00:48] Now we're in Mumbai. We just did a
[00:50] developer meetup here. About 200 people
[00:53] came and they're all really nice people
[00:56] trying to change the world with their
[00:58] code.
[01:03] [Music]
[01:09] And tonight we're leaving to a new
[01:11] country. I bet Mark is working hard
[01:14] before catching late night flight. So
[01:17] let's see if he's really working.
[01:21] Tissue, we're doing You're not working.
[01:24] You're supposed to work. Sorry. Sorry.
[01:27] It's 3:00 p.m. It's not playing time.
[01:29] Did you make some money? Come sit.
[01:31] Sorry. Very sorry. I needed little break
[01:35] me. Sorry.
[01:39] Wow.
[01:40] I think it's the biggest day for data
[01:42] fast. It's just today. Wow, that's nice.
[01:44] I'm forgiven. Okay,
[01:47] so my middle cow is back to work. We're
[01:50] about to leave to a special place
[01:52] because we are looking for a new house
[01:54] and this looks like a really good place
[01:57] for Mark to focus on work surf nice
[02:00] organic food of course for the milk cow
[02:02] and nice gym as well. We're going to
[02:04] pack the bag and then go to figure out
[02:07] how it goes.
[02:11] The startup office in the backpack and
[02:13] we can go LMG. Let's take the flight.
[02:16] Wow.
[02:23] [Music]
[02:29] [Music]
[02:31] Hello.
[02:33] Thank you. Thank you.
[02:44] We just made it to France. We're looking
[02:47] for a new home, a new place for the
[02:49] startup office, a new place to leave
[02:51] after Bali. And obviously France is it's
[02:53] La France. It's my hometown. There's a
[02:55] bunch of cheese. There's surf. We're
[02:56] going to stay here for about a month to
[02:58] see if that's a good place to live. I
[02:59] just woke up and I realized I have a
[03:01] little surprise for my wife.
[03:03] It took me 7 years to make 1 million
[03:06] online and it took another 7 months to
[03:08] make the second million. Don't give up.
[03:11] During those seven years, there hasn't
[03:12] been a single day without workout. A
[03:15] workout every single day. That's the key
[03:17] to keep grinding for seven years.
[03:19] [Music]
[03:24] [Music]
[03:40] I'm um I'm almost done with this book.
[03:43] It is the most practical book for any
[03:46] entrepreneur who is trying to make money
[03:48] online. It's packed with a bunch of
[03:50] strategies to help you get started. And
[03:52] I cheated a little bit. I went through
[03:54] the end of the book and I read this
[03:55] quote. You cannot lose if you don't
[03:57] quit. Now the thing is to win it might
[03:59] take a few years. So how do you not quit
[04:01] when you're not winning and for that you
[04:03] have to get results quickly. Now getting
[04:05] results is also hard. Now getting
[04:07] results feels like validation as an
[04:08] entrepreneur. But to get results quickly
[04:11] the one of the easiest way is to do what
[04:13] Alex mentioned in the book which is
[04:14] using cold emails. And this strategy is
[04:16] what I used initially to make my first
[04:18] dollar on the internet and grow a little
[04:20] software business to 4,000 in monthly
[04:22] recurring revenue. This is the best
[04:24] thing you can do because you get instant
[04:26] results. Like you can literally send 100
[04:28] cold emails today and get a market
[04:31] feedback on whether or not your offer is
[04:32] good. You'll learn about marketing
[04:34] psychology. And when you start winning,
[04:36] you will have something that you can
[04:37] share on social media where you have
[04:39] people willing to listen to what you
[04:40] have to offer. But you have to start
[04:41] with something that is very boring and
[04:43] cold emails is one of the easiest way to
[04:45] get started. What you could actually do
[04:46] is to copy an existing B2B business and
[04:49] you make an offer that is literally
[04:50] impossible to refuse. Every business
[04:52] wants to hire better talents. Every
[04:54] business want to get more customers.
[04:55] Every business owners want to have more
[04:57] time on their hands. So if you make any
[04:59] offer along these lines, you cannot go
[05:01] wrong. Read the book, start sending cold
[05:03] emails, start getting results, and
[05:05] everything will be easier. And now it's
[05:06] your turn. Off you go.
[05:12] I just prepared amazing meal for my cow
[05:14] and he just arrived the perfect time. So
[05:17] moo moo. Yeah. So this morning we did a
[05:21] bio age test and guess what? How old is
[05:24] he? They say 23 and they are super
[05:26] right. Wow. You already know the answer.
[05:28] So he's 23. I'm 30 and to be honest I
[05:31] feel very competitive. Like even though
[05:34] I'm one year older I am like
[05:36] biologically 7 years older than him.
[05:38] Like analyze my result and Oh you
[05:41] prepared play the whole like problem.
[05:46] Why? Basically, as a small person, I
[05:48] overtrained too much because I wanted to
[05:51] keep up with him and it gave me too much
[05:54] training and also I had too much LDL,
[05:57] the bad cholesterol. So, we try to eat
[06:00] less animal protein, less saturated fat,
[06:04] cheese, and also eat more plant-based
[06:06] protein, especially light dinner because
[06:10] when you eat a lot before sleeping, your
[06:13] sleep quality will be really low. And
[06:15] why not? This is the perfect setup for
[06:17] taking care of my cow as a A++ rating.
[06:20] Some of our friends roast us for eating
[06:22] tofu. But actually tofu is full of
[06:24] proteins and all the LDL cholesterol
[06:27] that you have in the meat is not there.
[06:28] So we try to do is we try to have like a
[06:30] meat, eggs and fish for lunch and more
[06:33] like tempered tofu for dinner. Yeah. And
[06:34] we also increase the zone four five
[06:38] cardio. That's why Mark was running. So
[06:40] V2 is the most important um health
[06:44] indicator. We were actually going to
[06:46] test this week or next week but roughly
[06:49] oop said I'm 54 56 and oh that's
[06:52] good. I started running few months ago
[06:55] from Korea and I my view to make
[06:58] increase so much and yeah be consistent.
[07:01] Consistent is the key. It's very it's
[07:03] super interesting like I'm grateful you
[07:05] take care of all those stuff. It's
[07:07] actually it's hard for everybody to do
[07:10] it. I think one of the way to actually
[07:12] do something is to test yourself, look
[07:15] at the data and just face what's the
[07:18] average data for people of your age.
[07:20] That for me was like a a wakeup call.
[07:22] You can do a blood test, you can wear a
[07:24] sleep tracker and you know how much deep
[07:25] sleep and REM sleep you get. You can
[07:27] like um invite your family, friends to
[07:30] do the healthy competence together so
[07:32] you don't feel lonely and yeah, it's
[07:34] really this conversation is never going
[07:35] to end. You know that. Yeah. Okay. So,
[07:37] that's it. That's it. That's it.
[07:45] I think I just found a way to steadily
[07:48] grow my new little startup. Let me show
[07:50] you something. So, this is the past 3
[07:53] months data for one of my little product
[07:55] called Dataf Fast. And as you can see
[07:56] with the monthly breaking growth, it's
[07:58] like growing around 15 to 20% month over
[08:01] month. and it's kind of steady which I
[08:04] think I found a little something a few
[08:06] months ago maybe four months ago I built
[08:08] this uh map where I can see visitors on
[08:12] my website but I make it in a way that
[08:14] is kind of new like you have this globe
[08:16] you can go around you can click on
[08:17] people see what they do on your site I
[08:19] even added a little loi station to the
[08:22] real time map I would not call it this
[08:24] as a painkiller feature but this is more
[08:26] sharable and since I am in a business
[08:28] where there are lots of uh competitors
[08:30] web analytics is a tough business and
[08:32] people don't really want to pay for web
[08:33] analytics. But with this uh little
[08:35] feature, I'm getting a new stream of
[08:37] users on a daily basis. I see bunch of
[08:39] tweets of people sharing their own globe
[08:42] on Twitter like this tweet and a bunch
[08:44] of others and people ask how did you get
[08:46] this globe? And they would of course
[08:47] plug uh my little startup which would
[08:50] bring me traffic. So somehow my users
[08:52] are doing marketing for me. And I think
[08:53] here there's a little lesson where even
[08:55] if you're in a crowded tough market, if
[08:58] you copy something that exists already,
[08:59] you're pretty sure it's going to work at
[09:01] some point because if it's working,
[09:03] people are already paying money for
[09:04] these kind of problems. So it's
[09:05] validated. And on top of that, if you
[09:07] plug your own signature, if you find a
[09:09] way to make this famous product special
[09:11] with your own touch, then maybe you will
[09:13] land on something. This little uh map
[09:15] project was born on a random Sunday. I
[09:17] had no idea. I just I didn't want to
[09:18] work on my typical day basis. I just
[09:20] wanted to randomly try vibe coding a few
[09:23] stuff and somehow this little feature is
[09:25] one of the best marketing channel for my
[09:27] product. So maybe just try some random
[09:29] stuff. Just rebuild an existing business
[09:31] and add your own signature. And who
[09:33] knows, maybe in a few weeks from now you
[09:35] will find a little something that will
[09:36] make your users do your own marketing
[09:38] and you will never have to do marketing
[09:40] again. Someone mentioned that I should
[09:41] add a casting option on the TV. And I
[09:44] realized there is a casting option on
[09:48] Google Chrome. And now I can have this
[09:51] huge massive screen showing my web
[09:54] analytics in real time in my living
[09:56] room. Isn't it amazing? I don't really
[09:58] like coding, but I just love the fact
[10:01] that I can turn my ideas into reality.
[10:04] [Music]
[10:09] Recently on my YouTube channel, I made
[10:10] this a video where I'm wearing a cure
[10:12] code t-shirt where if people scan it,
[10:14] they go to my site and if they buy it,
[10:16] I'll know it because I'm tracking them.
[10:17] And I was hoping that these little
[10:19] experiments could help me be healthy by
[10:22] walking 10,000 steps per day while
[10:25] technically doing a little bit of
[10:26] marketing. We went to India, we went to
[10:28] Paris, we went to Singapore wearing the
[10:31] t-shirt and for about 7 days, we made a
[10:33] bunch of B-rolls with a camera and I
[10:35] spent another 3 days editing this video
[10:37] myself. So that's a 10 days of work. I
[10:39] posted on YouTube and it was the biggest
[10:43] flop ever for all my videos. It hurts.
[10:46] It really hurts cuz it's 10 days of
[10:48] work. And also we thought it was a
[10:50] interesting angle and you're going you
[10:52] thought like oh it's going to work but
[10:54] the high expectation like more pain
[10:56] especially when you're getting started.
[10:58] This is what you're used to. You spend
[11:00] so much time working on something that
[11:01] does not work and you ship it. Whether
[11:04] it's a video, whether it's a startup,
[11:05] whether it's a tweet, and then just
[11:06] nothing happens. And this is so painful
[11:09] here. But I know if I keep putting
[11:11] little bits out there, at some point one
[11:14] will work and it will outsize all the
[11:16] previous ones that did not work. That
[11:18] will make the entire journey worth it.
[11:21] So keep shipping, make lots of bets, and
[11:24] few of the big success will compensate
[11:27] for a lot of failure. So do more crazy
[11:29] thing, do different things. This is a
[11:32] proper pep talkman.
[11:34] This is a Tony Robbins style of pep
[11:37] talk. What is the take away from this?
[11:38] In one sentence, what would be the
[11:40] takeaway? Do more crazy things and you
[11:43] will pay off your failures. Keep
[11:45] shipping.
[11:48] [Music]
[11:50] What are you doing? I don't know. I'm
[11:53] shipping.
[11:54] [Music]
[11:59] Of course, he will not stop walk without
[12:01] crazy things.
