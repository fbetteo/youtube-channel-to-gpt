[00:00] Imagine you own a small clothing shop.
[00:02] Someone walks in and you know instantly
[00:04] if they're going to buy. If they're not
[00:05] very likely to buy, you let them browse
[00:07] on their own. But if they're very likely
[00:09] to buy, you send over your best
[00:11] salesperson. You guide them. You show
[00:13] them your best stuff. Because when you
[00:14] know who is likely to purchase, you make
[00:16] smarter decision. You focus on the right
[00:18] customers and you make more money. Now,
[00:20] I don't own a clothing shop, but I build
[00:22] websites, a lot of them, like too many.
[00:24] And every day, random people visit them.
[00:26] Sometimes they buy something but most of
[00:28] the time they don't. This is when I had
[00:30] this dumb idea. Can AI predict when a
[00:33] visitor is going to buy my product? And
[00:35] if so, maybe AI can tell me when I will
[00:38] get rich. It was a typical Monday
[00:40] morning. I was switching between asking
[00:42] an AI to build my next startup and
[00:44] browsing Twitter. Then I got slapped in
[00:46] the face. My database build past $1,000
[00:50] per month. And it's not because I'm
[00:51] storing videos or anything fancy. It's
[00:53] just because I have a lot of data. I
[00:55] built this product called Dataf Fast.
[00:57] It's a web analytics. You add a script
[00:59] to your site and it tracks your
[01:00] visitors, where they come from, what
[01:02] they click, and how long they stay. I've
[01:04] got almost 200 paying customers. And he
[01:06] makes around 2,000 in monthly recurring
[01:08] revenue. Each of these customers track
[01:10] at least one website. And if you
[01:12] imagine, each sites gets a,000 visitors
[01:14] per day. That's hundred of thousands of
[01:16] page views getting recorded every single
[01:19] day. I built fast, so I didn't really
[01:21] care until the bill showed up. But here
[01:23] is something I've learned after 7 years
[01:25] building tiny internet startups. Big
[01:27] problems usually mean there is an
[01:29] opportunity somewhere. So instead of
[01:31] trying to save database cost, what if I
[01:33] could use all these data to help my
[01:35] customers, including myself, make more
[01:37] money online. So I went back to my desk
[01:39] and I wanted a simple way to rank
[01:41] visitors like giving them a score. Zero
[01:43] means that they're cold, they're not
[01:44] likely to buy. 50 is the average
[01:47] baseline. And 100 mean they're hot,
[01:49] they're very likely to purchase.
[01:50] Luckily, I had everything I needed
[01:52] because my product DataFast does not
[01:54] just track pages. It tracks the entire
[01:56] journey from the first click until they
[01:59] make a payment. So, first I had to
[02:00] analyze every website tracked with
[02:02] datafast. And for each of them, I
[02:04] generated a conversion profile. It's
[02:06] like a fingerprint of what a good
[02:08] customer looks like. I look at data like
[02:11] where do most paying customers come
[02:12] from? What device are they using? How
[02:14] many times do they visit the site before
[02:16] making a purchase? Then I wrote an
[02:18] algorithm. Well, an AI wrote the
[02:20] algorithm for me. It takes one visitor
[02:21] data and compare it with a website
[02:23] conversion profile and boom, it spits
[02:26] out a conversion score. Something like
[02:27] if the visitor is coming from the USA,
[02:29] they might get an extra 10 points. If
[02:31] they're using a MyBook Pro, they will
[02:32] get 20 points and if the first time they
[02:34] visit the website, they might lose five
[02:36] points. Next, I wanted to test this data
[02:38] to see how good my predictions are. So I
[02:40] asked my AI code editor to extract data
[02:43] and create a prompt for another AI to
[02:46] test and visualize how good the data is
[02:49] and surprisingly it was much better than
[02:51] I thought it would be. I wanted to feel
[02:53] what it meant to have visitors across
[02:55] the planet hot cold moving in real time.
[02:58] So I viodated a world map and the result
[03:01] looked terrible like my drawing when I
[03:03] was 5 years old. For about 5 minutes I
[03:05] genuinely thought I'd give up. Maybe
[03:06] this whole thing is just a stupid idea.
[03:09] Then I found Mapbox and within a few
[03:11] lines of code, the map looked great. Now
[03:13] the fun part, placing visitors on the
[03:15] map. I had to reverse engineer the world
[03:17] from city name to longitude and latitude
[03:19] to slap a tiny avatar exactly where the
[03:22] visitors are. Then I added prediction
[03:24] score. Each visitor would get a colored
[03:26] dot, blue for cold, red for hot, and
[03:28] gray for average. It started to feel
[03:30] alive, but not enough. So, I added more
[03:33] features showing the visitors hot to
[03:35] cold range, estimate how much they're
[03:37] worth, and display a percentage chance
[03:39] that they will convert. I showed it on
[03:40] Twitter and people loved it, which gave
[03:42] me, of course, the permission to waste
[03:43] more time on it. I added live events log
[03:46] like World of Warcraft, showing page
[03:48] views and page exit payments in real
[03:50] time. Clicking on an event would fly
[03:52] across the globe straight to the
[03:53] visitor. Then, someone on Twitter said,
[03:55] "You should make the map full screen and
[03:56] auto rotate." So, I did that, too.
[03:58] Another thing people kept asking is a
[04:00] way to see the globe without having to
[04:02] sign up for datafast. So I added this
[04:03] new feature where datafas users can now
[04:06] make their dashboard public and share it
[04:07] with a link. So if you want to see the
[04:09] globe in action, there will be a link
[04:10] below this video. This real time map
[04:12] feature make me feel like I was running
[04:14] some sort of startup command center
[04:16] while sitting in a coffee shop in Korea.
[04:18] It was beautiful. It was exciting. It
[04:20] was completely useless. It didn't do
[04:22] anything for users apart giving them a
[04:25] nice little dopamine hit. I needed to go
[04:27] further. So I spent a few days designing
[04:29] this big Apple keynote style visual
[04:31] showing patterns, trends, deeper insight
[04:33] about who is likely to buy. I launched
[04:34] on Twitter and nobody cared. Then I
[04:37] realized maybe instead of showing people
[04:39] the data, I should give them the data.
[04:41] So I went back to my laptop and built an
[04:43] API, a really simple one. You send a
[04:45] visitor's ID and you get back their
[04:47] prediction score, confidence level, and
[04:49] some metadata about who they are, like
[04:51] where they come from, how many times
[04:53] they visited, and what device they're
[04:55] using. It sounds simple, but it actually
[04:56] unlock lots of possibilities. For
[04:58] example, on my own site, Codefast, I use
[05:00] it to control when to show a lead
[05:02] magnet. If a visitor is unlikely to buy
[05:05] after 1 minute, I pop up a little offer
[05:07] asking for their email. And I have
[05:09] collected hundreds of emails in the past
[05:11] couple day using that method. Of course,
[05:13] if they're likely to buy, I leave them
[05:14] alone and let them purchase. And these
[05:16] predictions could be used for anything.
[05:18] Show a discount offer to visitors
[05:20] unlikely to buy or show a button to
[05:22] schedule a call for visitors who are
[05:24] likely to convert and build more trust.
[05:26] Then I had this crazy idea. I asked an
[05:29] AI to create an AI. Literally, I gave it
[05:31] my own website data, thousands of page
[05:34] views, events, and purchase. It created
[05:36] a prediction model using machine
[05:38] learning. It waited over 30 visitor
[05:40] signals from clicks to visit counts to
[05:42] session duration. And when I tested it,
[05:43] the results were crazy good. way better
[05:46] than anything I had built previously. It
[05:48] was the first time I saw it clearly. We
[05:50] are just scratching the surface. Today,
[05:52] most websites show the same web page to
[05:54] everyone. But what if the headline would
[05:56] be customized to your preference? What
[05:58] if the page would rewrite itself to
[06:00] match your motivations? Not in a creepy
[06:02] way, in a way that helps you find what
[06:04] you're looking for. The future is not a
[06:06] homepage. It's your page. And maybe,
[06:09] just maybe, this stupid little project
[06:11] is one small step toward that future.
