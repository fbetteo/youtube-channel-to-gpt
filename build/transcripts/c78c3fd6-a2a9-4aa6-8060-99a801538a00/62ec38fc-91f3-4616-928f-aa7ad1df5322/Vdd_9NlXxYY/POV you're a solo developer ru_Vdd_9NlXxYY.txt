[00:00] backpack this little backpack has eight
[00:01] tiny businesses very small businesses
[00:04] but we can move there anywhere we want
[00:06] are you ready let
[00:13] itce focus is
[00:18] overrated he almost guaranteed to make
[00:24] money wow
[00:31] hello the family just
[00:36] hello so where are we going now we're
[00:39] going to n p uhhuh um my parents decided
[00:44] to visit us in Bali for a couple days
[00:46] wow nice so we're moving the startup
[00:48] office somewhere else to a little
[00:50] Paradise Island it's like 40 minutes
[00:53] away from B it's a little it's actually
[00:54] a pretty big island we have this like
[00:57] very famous place where there's a cliff
[00:59] that looks like a dinosaur and uh you
[01:02] can go down the beach you can have fun
[01:04] it's
[01:05] beautiful they're going to visit that
[01:07] part wow look
[01:15] [Music]
[01:21] [Music]
[01:25] you so I'm uh I'm working on this new
[01:28] software I launched it a week ago it's
[01:30] called Data fast and it already has 300
[01:33] in monthly recurring Revenue as well as
[01:36] 133% of turn rate which is not really
[01:40] good so what I'm doing is I I get each
[01:43] customer's email and I ask them
[01:45] personally with my Gmail account why you
[01:47] stop your membership what is the one
[01:49] feature that's missing in the product
[01:50] that way I hope I'll collect good
[01:52] feedback to make to build a better
[01:53] product as well at eventually new
[01:55] startup ideas honestly it's the boring
[01:57] side of things business owners don't
[01:59] really talk about but I think this has
[02:01] lots of value when you start talking to
[02:02] your customers they see the email of the
[02:04] person who created the product they used
[02:07] and they are usually providing really
[02:08] good feedback and I believe if I keep
[02:11] listening to them eventually I'll land
[02:12] on a million dooll software
[02:21] [Music]
[02:27] [Music]
[02:30] a day in the life of a solo partner wow
[02:34] this is the
[02:36] dad and this is Mom right here if you
[02:40] ever come to Budd this is a absolutely
[02:43] crazy
[02:45] hike the final
[02:47] step if we're making it to the
[02:49] [Music]
[02:55] beach like I think focus is overrated I
[02:58] think I've focused two times in my life
[03:00] and every time I burned out because when
[03:02] you focus on something you put on the
[03:03] time you put on the work you have
[03:05] expectations and then after 3 months if
[03:07] you have no results you just burn out so
[03:09] I never focus on any product unless
[03:11] there's a clear Market feed then I spend
[03:12] all my time on it because I know there's
[03:14] a proof which was a case for chipas on
[03:17] the other side if you don't focus on
[03:18] something and you keep building little
[03:19] bricks here and there you have less
[03:21] expectation for one product and then
[03:24] your head is you zoom out from the
[03:26] product and instead of like making Indie
[03:28] page the perfect link bio for
[03:30] entrepreneurs by adding more features
[03:31] more features more features I'm more
[03:33] like yeah let's tweet about this and
[03:34] tweet about that and then I try new
[03:36] stuff short stuff and then suddenly I
[03:39] didn't have no expectation that it would
[03:41] become a backlink Marketplace it's an
[03:43] interesting conversation so yeah yeah I
[03:44] love I love this conversation people ask
[03:47] you what is the standard of like uh
[03:49] choosing good startup best startup so
[03:51] that people can like uh drop out the
[03:54] best project fast and then move on you
[03:56] know but in the beginning in the page
[03:58] looked like oh this a p obviously you
[04:01] shouldn't really focus for a long time
[04:03] and you should move on but like a late
[04:05] bloomer suddenly people it kind of like
[04:09] a discover the new market by itself and
[04:12] people suddenly find their like own
[04:15] solution from there so it's about timing
[04:18] you know I don't I don't think I think
[04:20] in this Cas in Chast timing is mattered
[04:22] but in this case I don't think timing
[04:24] matters it's more about having my head I
[04:27] Shi the side project it's not a clear
[04:29] here go like no nothing crazy happens I
[04:33] don't ditch it but I don't focus on it
[04:36] I'm working on other products I looking
[04:38] at what's happening in the revenue I
[04:39] looking at what people say I looking at
[04:40] the customer support and then something
[04:43] sometimes at a random moments something
[04:44] clicks like it was the case for the
[04:46] backlinks and then I have so many like
[04:48] man this is this is the same thing for
[04:49] all of my projects even the SEO project
[04:52] I made I shipped like a two month two
[04:54] two years ago like little SEO project
[04:56] and then I moved on and then from time
[04:58] to time I add one page for ranking and
[05:00] then slowly slowly slowly it starts to
[05:02] grow and then after years you start to
[05:04] see things feedback from people like
[05:06] whatever something happens and that is
[05:09] this is just what happening with with
[05:11] indepent so the important thing is don't
[05:13] put the too much High expectation on
[05:16] your actions and then keep it running
[05:19] and eventually and one of the seeds will
[05:22] grow like later exactly it's like
[05:25] planting seeds so that's why sometimes
[05:27] they will just fade and then nothing
[05:29] will happen soil is not good and
[05:31] sometime they will grow very late and
[05:33] sometime they will grow because of
[05:34] another seed you planted later will make
[05:36] it grow and then it feeds by
[05:50] itself on the fairy back home I was
[05:53] checking my phone some YouTube comments
[05:55] and I see this question popping all the
[05:57] time about how to find startup ideas
[06:00] and now it's kind of easy for me to find
[06:02] startup ideas because I have like built
[06:04] 25 websites so problems happen all the
[06:06] times and when there's a problem there's
[06:08] a solution there's a great startup idea
[06:10] but the thing is when I got started I
[06:11] had zero business idea that I could
[06:14] build because I had no problems and I
[06:16] was looking for this creative idea that
[06:18] would be promising and eventually makes
[06:20] money but I I couldn't come up with any
[06:22] but I found the easiest way to come up
[06:25] with an idea that is almost guaranteed
[06:28] to make money there are already existing
[06:30] markets there are existing problems and
[06:32] there are existing solutions for those
[06:34] problems people are already paying for
[06:36] that so the money is already flowing
[06:38] there is no need to come up with a new
[06:39] creative idea sometimes the easiest way
[06:42] is to just replicate something that is
[06:44] already working and make your own
[06:46] version out of it my my 25th startup
[06:49] data FAS is just web analytics nothing
[06:52] special but the market is here people
[06:54] are already paying for these kind of
[06:55] tools so if if you're if you're if
[06:57] you're just getting started and you're
[06:58] looking for an idea to build could be an
[07:02] existing problem find something find
[07:04] something where people are already
[07:05] paying money for and make your own
[07:07] version of what you think the solution
[07:09] should be add your touch add your
[07:11] signature make it playful make it super
[07:14] easy to use add some some stuff that
[07:16] were not there already but make sure you
[07:18] focus on a problem that exists already
[07:21] and that people are already paying for
[07:22] it that makes me think I have tons of
[07:24] work to finish before the week ends and
[07:27] so it's time to go back to work
[07:41] I mean I think this is terrible and it
[07:43] it's applied from anything from
[07:44] lifestyle to
[07:46] business there people who don't want to
[07:48] change and then they feel bad when
[07:50] someone is trying to do a different way
[07:52] I don't like to wear clothes so being
[07:54] topless is weird or I'm learning how to
[07:57] code and there is this software engineer
[07:59] who's been here in the industry for 10
[08:00] years he telling me you have to use this
[08:03] framework yeah I'm like yeah but this
[08:05] one looks like much no you have to use
[08:07] this like this's this this really sense
[08:09] of like this is the way things should be
[08:11] done and if you don't do that then
[08:13] you're wrong and when you're getting
[08:15] started you don't you have you don't
[08:16] have a confidence so you don't question
[08:18] that and if you do you still feel bad
[08:20] because in the end you you don't have
[08:22] foundation so you're not sure and you
[08:23] easily lose your confidence which is
[08:25] everything at the beginning when you
[08:26] start you need the confidence right cuz
[08:27] that's that's how you keep going where
[08:29] working from home sleeping 9 hours at
[08:31] night I would never believe it because I
[08:33] believed what I saw on social media and
[08:35] somehow by finding this little success
[08:37] and success and success I starting to
[08:38] follow my own way and I realize
[08:41] everything I've seen maybe it works for
[08:44] some others but it doesn't work for me
[08:45] and I wish I knew that earlier so I
[08:47] didn't have to pretend play the game
[08:50] that they've you know set up mhm and
[08:53] that goes for again like uh whatever
[08:55] whether it's like daily habits about
[08:57] sleep and not working too hard or it's
[08:59] about using these special new framework
[09:02] that the JavaScript engineer should all
[09:04] be using it's all [ __ ] man yeah
[09:07] sometimes I wish I would be back in time
[09:10] and and see 21 years old Mark and just
[09:13] tell him come on bro just keep doing
[09:15] what you're doing like don't try to
[09:16] change don't try to please someone don't
[09:17] try to follow someone just keep doing
[09:20] your own way if you have this stupid
[09:21] idea follow it if you don't want to wear
[09:23] t-shirt don't wear t-shirts and who
[09:25] cares who says
[09:27] what he's a good man
[09:30] [Music]
[09:50] so my parents are visiting us in Bali
[09:53] and uh since they've been hosting me for
[09:56] 20 years of their life I want to kind of

[10:34] million I just came back from a
[10:36] delicious lunch with my parents and um I
[10:39] was surprised because my mind was some
[10:41] sometimes thinking about work problems
[10:44] always happen like all the time there
[10:46] are problems at the beginning there are
[10:48] problems when you start to make money
[10:49] there are problem when you make more
[10:51] money I think learning how to deal with
