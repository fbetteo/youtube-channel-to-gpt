[00:01] so I get just earn $1,000 and here is my
[00:05] reward who's the boss I'll never forget
[00:08] my first customers it's a wonderful
[00:10] feeling to make money on the internet
[00:12] with my own little creation so in this
[00:13] video I'm going to show you how I use
[00:15] hiker news to drive well over 25,000
[00:17] visitors for my software AI tools and
[00:19] habit trackers you'll see there are some
[00:21] patterns you can replicate to get
[00:23] visibility and customers for your own
[00:25] project but there are some very strong
[00:27] codes on hiker news and if you don't
[00:28] want your post to go seen or worst
[00:31] getting banned you want to avoid the
[00:32] three mistakes I will share at the end
[00:33] of the video let's go at the very
[00:35] beginning of the journey when I just got
[00:36] started and had zero experience I
[00:38] launched mood to movie on hicker news
[00:40] and within a few hours the post went
[00:41] viral it got 5,000 visitors at the
[00:43] beginning and I didn't know but it was
[00:45] the spark of something way bigger there
[00:47] are tons of other platforms that feed
[00:49] off hiker news content and when they see
[00:51] top performing post they will usually
[00:53] reshare the content later and so
[00:55] occasionally I would see my app movie
[00:57] being re-shared on other Platforms in
[00:59] Tik Tok news lators and other Tech
[01:01] aggregators and sometimes even in
[01:03] languages I don't understand a few
[01:05] months later I replicated the exact same
[01:07] formula for my habit tracker called
[01:09] habits garden and the post went viral
[01:11] again hitting the front page of haer
[01:13] news and this time the app was monetized
[01:15] so I made a couple $100 and also reach
[01:17] 100 Mr within just a few days and I keep
[01:20] replicating the same formula over and
[01:22] over for the past 2 and a half years and
[01:23] even though not every post will go viral
[01:25] it usually bring good traffic and
[01:27] customers for my own project and I'm
[01:28] going to share exactly what I learned if
[01:30] you don't know what hiker news is it's a
[01:32] tech news aggregator read by developers
[01:34] software Engineers it's run by the
[01:35] community so anyone can post anything
[01:38] and other people vote and choose which
[01:40] post goes up or down and you will see
[01:42] why this is important for us later it
[01:44] was created by y combinator the famous
[01:46] startup incubator so there is a special
[01:48] category for people like you and I to
[01:49] share our own little startups even
[01:51] though we don't aim to build unicorns
[01:53] let me show you the results I got with
[01:55] that the first thing you want to do is
[01:56] to post in the right place in hiker news
[01:58] there are a bunch of category only one
[02:00] matters to us it's the show Hacker News
[02:02] category this is a place where people
[02:04] like you and I where we can share our
[02:05] own little project when you submit your
[02:07] post write show hn column before your
[02:10] title that way your post will
[02:12] automatically be posted in the right
[02:14] category of hiker news first your post
[02:16] will be shown in the/ new subcategory
[02:19] it's a mandatory Place uh every new post
[02:21] has to go through and if it gets a
[02:23] couple of OD votes then he will go to
[02:24] the SL show category I suspect there is
[02:27] a moderator that checks the quality of
[02:30] those post so follow along with the uh
[02:32] things not to do later because this is
[02:34] very important if you want to be
[02:35] promoted if your post is promoted to the
[02:37] slash show category you will get a bunch
[02:40] of traffic couple thousands of traffic
[02:41] as well as a lot of comments and
[02:43] feedback from the community and
[02:44] sometimes if you're very lucky your post
[02:46] will appear in the slash category the
[02:48] main homepage of Hacker News I've never
[02:50] been there but I've seen some other
[02:51] Indie makers reaching that stage and you
[02:53] get crazy traffic all right so the
[02:55] second part to increase your chances to
[02:56] go viral is to be very personal you are
[02:59] not a faceless Corporation trying to
[03:00] make more money you are a cool developer
[03:02] building cool apps in your bedroom or
[03:05] after your 9 to5 and you want to
[03:06] showcase that start your post with
[03:08] something very personal saying things
[03:10] like I made I built or after 6 months
[03:13] coding blah blah blah those usually go
[03:15] pretty well just tell your own story
[03:17] with simple words all right the third
[03:20] part is you want to use The Hacker News
[03:22] language it's a community that's read by
[03:24] developers and Tech enthusiasts so you
[03:26] want to talk to them and for that you
[03:28] want to use Tech words like GPT for SEO
[03:31] or whatever llm is being released at
[03:33] time of the video if you're using
[03:34] generic words like a course coaching or
[03:37] e-commerce it's likely to be ignored
[03:39] unless you turn it into a techy world
[03:42] for instance my habit tracker called
[03:43] habits Garden is just a simple habit
[03:45] trucker but the fact that there are some
[03:47] uh games features like leaderboards and
[03:50] competing with friends I use the word
[03:51] gamified I gamified a habit tracker to
[03:54] fight procrastination and thanks to that
[03:56] the post went viral and get well over
[03:58] 10,000 visitors so you won to make sure
[04:00] to include some kind of techy words in
[04:02] your post the fourth and probably the
[04:04] most important tip is to tell the
[04:06] outcome your post will be competing
[04:08] against dozens of other higher News Post
[04:10] and you have 60 characters to convince
[04:12] someone to click on your post and for
[04:14] that you want to tell exactly what
[04:16] people will get by clicking on it all
[04:18] the product we buil serves a purpose and
[04:21] you want to showcase that part in your
[04:22] title why is it worth my time what's
[04:24] makes it special how is it going to help
[04:26] me if it helps I have a simple formula I
[04:28] use pretty much all the time I start
[04:30] with I made to be personal then I
[04:32] include the product with if possible a
[04:34] tech word like a nextg boiler plate and
[04:37] then I tell the outcome like to ship
[04:39] startups faster or to automate all the
[04:42] boring stuff and finally you want to
[04:44] contribute after you make your own post
[04:46] go in the comment section and write the
[04:48] first comment and explain your story
[04:50] like hey I'm Mark and I realized I was
[04:51] spending lots of money for stripe
[04:53] invoices so I built an alternative show
[04:55] people that you're an actual human
[04:56] behind the post tell them your story
[04:58] tell them what may you create these
[05:00] products and if your PO get up and start
[05:02] to get some traffic you will get some
[05:03] genuine comments from hiker news readers
[05:05] they're usually pretty rough but they're
[05:07] also pretty accurate and they give good
[05:08] feedbacks make sure to reply to comments
[05:10] and ask question because that could be
[05:12] really helpful for you to know which
[05:13] features next to build for your product
[05:15] all right now three mistakes you really
[05:16] want to avoid if you don't want your
[05:18] post to go unseen or even worse getting
[05:20] banned the first one is to avoid emojis
[05:23] don't ask me why Hacker News doesn't
[05:25] like emojis so don't use them the second
[05:27] mistake and probably the most common one
[05:29] I actually made did in my post got B is
[05:31] to ask for up votes unlike other
[05:33] platforms like product tant where you
[05:34] can ask friends and family to support
[05:35] you on hiker news it's against their
[05:37] policies as I said before I believe
[05:39] there is a person that decides which
[05:41] post can be promoted from the show new
[05:43] category to the show category and I'm
[05:44] pretty sure that moderator has access to
[05:46] some more data that we have so for
[05:48] instance if you send your Hacker News
[05:49] Post to friends and family the moderator
[05:51] will see that the traffic is coming
[05:52] directly from that link or that the up
[05:54] votes were made by new Hacker News
[05:56] accounts which looks pretty suspicious
[05:58] instead of asking for super ort spend
[06:00] more time crafting your headline because
[06:02] this is how your post can go viral and
[06:04] finally do not overthink it there is
[06:06] very little you can do to influence the
[06:08] reach of your post so make sure you
[06:09] craft a good headline post it and move
[06:11] on your first post might not be the one
[06:13] that goes viral but if you keep
[06:14] repeating the same strategy over and
[06:16] over you increase your odds of winning
[06:18] there are many ways to get traffic for
[06:19] your startup even if you don't have an
[06:21] audience I'm working on making those
[06:23] videos to help you get customers and if
[06:24] you don't want to miss them out you can
[06:26] subscribe to the channel and there is a
[06:27] link to my blog in the description of
[06:28] this video where I share almost
[06:30] everything I know about marketing you
[06:31] can check that out until the next video
[06:33] I hope you just ship it
