[00:00] after I got fired as a software engineer
[00:02] in November 2021 I started building tiny
[00:04] little websites with one goal in mind
[00:06] become financially independent as I'm
[00:08] recording this video I made
[00:10] $121,000 in the last 30 days with seven
[00:12] website I built 92% of that is profit
[00:15] and I am a solo developer wearing
[00:17] underwear all day long except when I'm
[00:18] making those videos I don't have any
[00:20] employee I don't have any meetings I
[00:21] don't have any deadlines I got lucky in
[00:24] fact exactly one year ago I was making
[00:26] $11,000 per month with all my websites
[00:28] and when I got started I made $ for 5
[00:31] months I would never believe what's
[00:32] happening today because there is no
[00:34] magic recipe for success but I
[00:36] discovered something when I started the
[00:37] journey 900 days ago I joined Twitter
[00:39] and hang out with other developers
[00:41] chasing the same dream build our own app
[00:43] and Achieve Financial Freedom every day
[00:45] we'll share progress we make on our
[00:46] little website and share our learnings
[00:48] but after a few months not getting
[00:49] really good results most of them stopped
[00:51] showing up daily and gave up but a small
[00:54] group of developers did not give up and
[00:56] keep showing up fast forward to today
[00:58] most of those developers make well over
[01:00] $10,000 per month so here is the thing
[01:03] luck is math if you show up for long
[01:05] enough even though you don't feel like
[01:06] it luck will find you I launched website
[01:09] in the void for 600 days there were tons
[01:12] of opportunities to give up but I kept
[01:14] showing up every single day and I would
[01:17] never earn 120k in the last 30 days if I
[01:19] gave them so here are three ways I manag
[01:21] to say consistent and motivated shipping
[01:23] apps every day for the past 2 and A2
[01:25] years the first project I work on as an
[01:27] independent developer is called mood to
[01:29] movie it's a very simple app that
[01:31] recommends movies based on your mood it
[01:33] took me just a few days to build the
[01:34] first version of the product because in
[01:36] my head there is some kind of monkey
[01:38] that wants to have instant results so I
[01:40] can easily convince him to work hard for
[01:42] a couple days but it's much harder to
[01:44] get it to work hard on something without
[01:45] getting results for month in fact in
[01:47] 2017 when I started the journey I spent
[01:50] an entire year working on a product that
[01:51] got zero users and I just burned out
[01:53] completely and stop working on any
[01:55] project for another year so now whatever
[01:57] I have an ID in mind I always try to
[01:59] ship the smallest version of that
[02:01] product usually one feature that I can
[02:03] build in a couple days sometimes a week
[02:05] and show it as fast as I can to
[02:07] customers I usually don't like hanging
[02:09] out with people I spend most of my time
[02:11] alone or hanging out with my wife but
[02:13] being isolated is no good and at the
[02:15] same times humans are very social
[02:17] creatures and we can leverage those
[02:19] social interactions to motivate
[02:20] ourselves when I joined Twitter 2 and a
[02:22] half years ago I would follow other
[02:24] developers doing the same thing as me
[02:26] and I remember this guy called dun he
[02:27] was writing crispy tweets and he had
[02:29] around the same number of followers as
[02:31] me and every morning I would try to make
[02:32] a tweet that would have more likes or
[02:34] engagement than him it usually did sorry
[02:36] buddy there is Another Monkey in my
[02:38] brain that wants to play game so I
[02:40] compare myself with other entrepreneurs
[02:41] at the same stage so I can leverage my
[02:44] desire for competition no jealousy just
[02:46] healthy competition because in the end
[02:48] we all win most of my product made at
[02:50] least $1 and so I was really tempted to
[02:52] focus and try to grow each of them and
[02:54] actually people ask me often why do I
[02:56] work on so many project instead of
[02:58] focusing on just one and there is
[02:59] another monkey in my head that have
[03:01] expectations the more time I spend on a
[03:03] specific task the higher the
[03:04] expectations so I could select one
[03:06] project and keep adding features and
[03:07] features and features but that will also
[03:09] grow my expectations and if nothing big
[03:11] happens then I will just simply burn out
[03:14] instead I will launch a tiny website and
[03:16] move on to the next project unless
[03:18] something big happens like it was the
[03:19] case for ship fast one of my products I
[03:21] would rather quit too early and miss an
[03:23] opportunity than quit too late and
[03:25] burnout shipping websites is like a
[03:27] muscle if you on progress you have to
[03:29] practice consist L try looking one hour
[03:31] every day with you and your code editor
[03:33] until it becomes a habit and to avoid
[03:35] losing motivation and stay consistent
[03:38] try what worked for me sh very tiny
[03:39] little projects join some kind of
[03:41] community where there are like-minded
[03:43] people where you can healthily compete
[03:44] against them and quit even if it's too
[03:46] early so you don't burn out in the end
[03:48] entrepreneurs who show up daily will be
[03:50] rewarded I've seen this with my own
[03:52] experience as well as other developers
[03:54] so now it's your time to commit and feel
[03:56] that GitHub contribution board all right
[03:58] if you want to see the 20 plus website I
[04:00] built as an independent developer here's
[04:02] a link to another video and if you enjoy
[04:04] this one consider subscribing to the
[04:05] channel that really means a lot and
[04:07] until the next video I root for you and
[04:08] I hope you just ship it
