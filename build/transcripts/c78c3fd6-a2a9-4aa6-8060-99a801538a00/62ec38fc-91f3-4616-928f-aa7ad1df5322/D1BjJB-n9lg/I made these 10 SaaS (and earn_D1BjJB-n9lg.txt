[00:00] I have built these 10 software
[00:02] businesses. Altogether, they made over
[00:03] $200,000 US at around 90 to 95% profit
[00:07] margin and everything is automated.
[00:09] There is barely any customer support.
[00:10] So, I'm literally making money while I
[00:12] slip. In this video, I'm going to walk
[00:14] you over those seven SAS that are still
[00:16] active. I'm going to show you how I got
[00:18] the ideal, how I got customers for $0
[00:20] when I didn't even have an audience, and
[00:22] how much revenue in total they have
[00:24] generated. All right, first software is
[00:26] Habit Garden. It's a little to-do list,
[00:28] like a habit tracker, uh, that is
[00:30] gamified, so people play games when they
[00:32] track their habits. Uh, it is priced at
[00:34] $5 a month or $47 for the lifetime deal.
[00:37] And it has an iOS Android app. Actually,
[00:40] this is what my uh this is what my
[00:41] habits garden dashboard looks like. This
[00:43] is my actual app. And once I have
[00:45] completed my habits, they have like
[00:47] those uh little missions where I have
[00:49] quests, stuff, I can grow a garden, I
[00:51] can play with friends, etc. Now,
[00:52] revenue-wise, this app started in 2022,
[00:56] and I made around $20,000 with this app.
[00:59] This is a little bit of a complex story
[01:00] because uh it started in 2022. I made
[01:03] around $1,000 with the web app and
[01:05] another $1,000 with the iOS Android app.
[01:08] And then I didn't know how to grow the
[01:09] startup more than that. And someone
[01:11] reached out to me, offered to buy the
[01:12] app for $10,000, zero call, just one DM.
[01:14] I said yes because I was running out of
[01:16] money. And a year later, this person
[01:18] came back to me and said like, "Hey, I
[01:19] don't have the time to uh grow the app.
[01:21] I'll give it back to you for free. This
[01:23] is really mindblowing. I'm so grateful
[01:26] it happened to me. And so since that I
[01:29] started a new Stripe account. So this is
[01:31] the actual Stripe account and it's
[01:33] around uh 40 monthly recurring revenue
[01:35] right now on the web app and on the iOS
[01:37] Android app it's around 140 in monthly
[01:40] recurring revenue. And so I think in the
[01:42] last 30 days it makes around $400. How
[01:45] did I get this idea? So again I started
[01:47] in 2022. Back then I just recovered from
[01:49] a depression. I got a job as a software
[01:51] engineer and got fired. And I just
[01:53] wanted to build stuff on the internet. I
[01:55] played this game World of Warcraft way
[01:57] too much. Undead mage over 200 days of
[02:00] game played way too much. But I know
[02:02] that games can bring people to do right
[02:04] things. And around the same time, I was
[02:06] reading the book Why We Sleep by Matthew
[02:09] Walker and I realized how much daily
[02:10] habits like workouts, sleep, and diet
[02:12] impact my mood. And I wanted to combine
[02:15] those two and I created a habit tracker
[02:17] that is gamified. Now getting customers
[02:19] was the hard part because then I just
[02:20] started the journey like building stuff
[02:22] in public and I had no idea how to get
[02:24] customers. One of the first thing I did
[02:25] is to um create a Twitter account and
[02:27] started sharing like screenshots of the
[02:29] app I'm building. This is how I got the
[02:31] first 10 or maybe 50 users. And then I
[02:33] started to make videos like this that
[02:34] are like promotional videos but in a fun
[02:36] way. So it looks like a it looks like I
[02:39] am playing like a World of Warcraft in
[02:41] real life. And this is what got me
[02:42] attention on Twitter in YouTube
[02:44] initially. I I had to use my wife as a
[02:46] character in the game. This was one of
[02:49] the way of growing this app. The second
[02:50] one and by far my favorite marketing
[02:52] strategy is free tools. So I built bunch
[02:55] of like little website like this one
[02:57] visualizehabit.com
[02:58] where it's like a free website where you
[03:00] can create a little habit grid just like
[03:02] this. So let's say you want to uh
[03:04] meditate like I don't know 10 minutes
[03:05] every day and you want to sleep let's
[03:08] say 8 hours a day. Then you can have a
[03:10] little grid like this where you can
[03:12] visualize how much uh you will achieve
[03:14] in one year. This is very visual. This
[03:17] is uh something that people shared a
[03:18] lot. And when you click next, then it
[03:20] makes a promotion for my habit tracker.
[03:21] And you can click and then it will just
[03:23] start the habit tracker and it's going
[03:25] to automatically import all of those
[03:27] habits inside of the habit tracker. This
[03:29] works so well because um it's sharable.
[03:32] People can share it and it goes viral.
[03:34] In fact, this is exactly what happened
[03:35] on Reddit. I made these posts two was I
[03:38] think it's over two years ago probably
[03:39] like close to three years ago and the
[03:41] pause got almost 6,000 likes. I got
[03:44] really a bunch of users uh coming from
[03:46] this visualize habit tool funnel to my
[03:49] habit tracker. Now in 2025 I think it is
[03:52] really hard to make an app that charge
[03:54] recurring subscription for people who
[03:56] are not businesses or B2C business with
[03:58] a subscription. I think it is really
[03:59] hard. If I had to start again, I would
[04:02] probably do like Instagram and Tik Tok
[04:04] like share bunch of videos like either
[04:06] inspirational videos or challenges etc.
[04:08] I would try to use those platform more
[04:10] in order to grow my habit tracker
[04:12] software. Number two, we have Indie
[04:14] Page. It's a little website builder like
[04:16] a no code builder for people who want to
[04:18] create a little portfolio on the
[04:19] internet. It is priced at $25 a year or
[04:22] $45 for a lifetime deal. On the inside,
[04:25] it looks like this like a a bunch of
[04:27] form for people they can add their
[04:28] website etc. It also connects
[04:30] automatically with a Stripe account. So
[04:32] if you know if you're an entrepreneur,
[04:33] you want to share your revenue on the
[04:34] internet, this is the the place to do
[04:36] it. Now, revenue-wise, I started this
[04:38] project around 2023 and made $43,000
[04:42] from it. So this is the first Stripe
[04:45] account. So when I started in 2023 and
[04:47] since I changed my business, I had to
[04:49] change the Stripe account as well. So
[04:51] this is the secondary Stripe dashboard.
[04:53] By the way, those spikes of revenue here
[04:55] is what happens when I focus on
[04:57] marketing. But uh unfortunately I got a
[04:59] little bit bored and I moved on. Now how
[05:01] did I get this idea and I love this
[05:03] project because it is a perfect example
[05:06] to show that startup ideas don't matter.
[05:08] The best way to find a good startup idea
[05:10] is to create stuff create a lot of noise
[05:12] and then you will find signal out of it.
[05:14] So for instance uh this is an really old
[05:16] website of mine back then I had uh
[05:18] because of the previous software I had a
[05:20] little audience on Twitter like maybe
[05:22] 100 people and I started to create a
[05:25] little website like a personal website
[05:27] where I would showcase all the little
[05:28] projects I work on and I would add this
[05:30] link to my Twitter bio and people
[05:32] mention in my DM I would love to create
[05:35] the same website as you and boom there
[05:37] we go just like that I had this idea of
[05:39] creating a website builder build builder
[05:40] for entrepreneurs who want to showcase
[05:42] their work now getting customers was
[05:44] kind of fun for this one because I also
[05:45] came up with a bunch of ideas. The first
[05:47] one was to get the product into the
[05:48] hands of famous people on Twitter. So,
[05:51] Arvid, Damon, all those guys have
[05:53] already over way over 10,000 followers
[05:55] on Twitter. And I try to get them to use
[05:57] my app so that I have some kind of
[05:58] social proof to show on the landing
[06:00] page. And then the second thing I did
[06:02] once I had a little bit of social proof
[06:03] was to launch on Product Hunt, a popular
[06:05] platform for people to launch startups.
[06:07] And it got a bunch of up votes. It got
[06:09] the badge like number one of the days.
[06:10] So the product was shared on newsletter,
[06:12] social media, etc. And then the part you
[06:14] see here where it's like growing and
[06:16] spikes is because then I decided to
[06:18] build more free tools. For instance, I
[06:20] built this like a little Twitter bot
[06:22] that is connected with my software and
[06:24] then it's basically going to share
[06:26] whenever someone makes a sale. So for
[06:28] instance 6 hours ago, I know that I made
[06:30] a $25 sale for this product. So it's
[06:32] basically like a feed of all the makers
[06:34] that are registered with the platforms
[06:36] and how much money they're making. And
[06:37] on top of that, and I think one of the
[06:39] features that at the moment drive the
[06:40] most revenue is because there is now a
[06:42] solid user base. Uh I created this like
[06:45] slash leaderboard page where I kind of
[06:47] frame it as a challenge. Can you make
[06:49] $1,000 online? Uh people here are
[06:51] verified with Stripe. So they have
[06:52] connected their Stripe account and I
[06:54] compute their revenue in the last 30
[06:56] days and alltime revenue. This guy is
[06:58] absolutely crushing it and all the other
[07:00] guys as well. This is something that you
[07:02] can share on social media cuz it's very
[07:03] interesting. You see all those people
[07:04] making money online. It's inspirational.
[07:06] It's sharable and this drives a lot of
[07:08] traffic and creates a bunch of new user
[07:10] accounts every day. Up next, we have SAS
[07:12] number three and probably my biggest
[07:14] mistake, workbook PDF. It's an AI
[07:17] educational platform where people can
[07:19] create workbook to practice their
[07:20] language and learn a new well a new
[07:22] language. It is priced at um it's a it's
[07:26] a pass system. So, it's kind of like a
[07:27] monthly without the recurring part. So,
[07:29] if you want to access the app for 30
[07:30] days, you'll have to pay $29 and you can
[07:32] create unlimited workbooks. And students
[07:34] will just go here, pick the language
[07:35] they want to learn, what is their levels
[07:37] and then they will pick topics on which
[07:39] they want to create this workbook. They
[07:41] would basically create a customized
[07:43] language platform for them. Then they
[07:45] would get PDF like this ones where um in
[07:48] this case I'm want to learn Portuguese
[07:49] with topics like the beach, surf, etc.
[07:52] And then you will create a grammar
[07:53] exercise, vocabulary exercise on based
[07:55] on those topics. Uh revenue wise it uh
[07:58] it's pretty much of a failure compared
[07:59] to all of my other project. It made in
[08:01] total $2.4,000. $4,000. I launched the
[08:04] app somewhere in July 2023. There's a
[08:07] little spike because then back then I
[08:09] started to have a little audience. So
[08:10] some people tried the app and then it
[08:11] went down to almost zero. It's slowly
[08:14] picking up at the moment. I will explain
[08:16] what is going on with the marketing. How
[08:17] did I get this idea? Uh well, I got
[08:20] married to a beautiful Korean wife back
[08:22] in 2023 and I was thinking I have to
[08:24] learn Korean at some point. Since I am a
[08:26] kid, I hate school. I hate the way
[08:28] people teach me stuff because it's
[08:30] usually very boring. And I was like,
[08:31] what if I create a way for me to learn
[08:33] Korean on topics I like to get
[08:35] customers. So again, I did the launch
[08:37] part at the beginning which created a
[08:38] spike. And then the big part of the
[08:40] marketing was on SEO site on this
[08:43] workbookf.com. There are like hundreds
[08:45] maybe thousands of pages indexed on
[08:47] Google. The Google search console
[08:48] actually looks like this. At the moment,
[08:50] I tried to rank for a bunch of keywords
[08:52] like English workbook PDF for
[08:54] intermediate people, English workbook
[08:55] PDF for advanced people, pre-workbook to
[08:58] learn Japanese. There really are a bunch
[08:59] of keywords out there and I'm just
[09:00] trying to rank them on Google. SEO wise,
[09:02] it's making sense because it's driving
[09:04] at least 100 clicks per day and it keeps
[09:06] growing up. Uh the thing is I don't
[09:09] think this kind of educational app would
[09:12] be a best feat on Google. I think it's
[09:14] more something like you discover on
[09:16] social media like you watch a Tik Tok of
[09:18] someone that says they learn to learn a
[09:19] language in like seven days and then
[09:21] you're like, "Oh, what is the app you're
[09:22] using?" I think if I had to grow this
[09:24] app again, I would probably do this
[09:26] social media strategy. Sess number four,
[09:28] here we go. This is by dispute. It's a
[09:32] no code tool to help people who have a
[09:34] strap account not getting banned by
[09:36] analyzing their payments and refunding
[09:38] or at least alarming them if there is
[09:41] something suspicious. For instance, if
[09:42] the account received two payment with
[09:44] the same card within 15 minutes, um you
[09:46] might want to refund the last payment
[09:48] because it's likely a fraud or someone
[09:49] who made a mistake. On the inside, it
[09:51] looks like this. It's a product that I
[09:53] use for every single of my other
[09:54] products. So um anyone can add a little
[09:56] new stripe account. There are few sets
[09:58] of rules and there are some actions to
[10:01] prevent an eventual dispute. It is
[10:03] priced in a system of credit. So for
[10:05] instance a 100,000 protected transaction
[10:08] would cost $219. Revenue wise uh we are
[10:11] sitting at almost $8,000 since I
[10:14] launched it about a year ago. Uh so
[10:16] again I have two Stripe accounts. This
[10:18] one uh back in 2023 and this new one
[10:22] right now my new business. That's
[10:24] roughly $8,000. I think that will bring
[10:26] me to the uh idea, how I found the idea.
[10:28] I'm going to go deeper into that. So,
[10:30] back in 2022 when I was working on the
[10:33] first SAS, I got banned overnight
[10:35] overnight from Stripe. And being banned
[10:37] from Stripe meaning like all my other
[10:39] Stripe account will be frozen. This as a
[10:41] business owner, even now in 2025, I am
[10:43] scared as this is literally the worst
[10:46] thing that can happen to me as a
[10:47] business owner. And then I analyzed a
[10:49] little bit of what happened and I
[10:50] realized that all of those payments were
[10:52] made by the same customer, the same
[10:54] email address. And that's how the idea
[10:56] of creating um a little tool that sits
[10:59] in between Stripe and your business to
[11:00] listen for transaction and find some uh
[11:03] likely fraudulent patterns to eventually
[11:05] refund payments so there's no dispute
[11:06] possible. Getting customers initially
[11:08] was launching on Twitter. I make this
[11:11] video with Leonardo DiCaprio
[11:16] where uh I I educate Leonardo DiCaprio
[11:20] on why disputes are a big deal for
[11:23] Stripe businesses and how to prevent
[11:24] them. I already had a little audience
[11:26] back then, but it did not matter. The
[11:28] tweet went viral. I think it's like half
[11:30] a million views and 2,000 likes. I
[11:32] believe that anyone who would make a
[11:34] similar kind of videos would also go
[11:35] viral. And that brought the first batch
[11:37] of users to the app. Uh the second thing
[11:39] I did is is SEO like pure SEO boring
[11:42] writing articles. I wrote around 10
[11:44] articles that are now indexed on Google
[11:46] and they bring somewhere from 7 10 um I
[11:49] would say 5 to 20 uh qualified clicks
[11:52] per day. The SEO articles are targeted
[11:54] toward like stripe dispute. So this is
[11:56] talking for people who are already
[11:58] looking for a solution and I believe
[11:59] this is how I get customers at the
[12:02] moment for this product. So one more
[12:03] time here marketing wise um the problem
[12:05] here is I am not the right person to
[12:06] grow this kind of product. Uh I think I
[12:09] would need to target bigger companies
[12:10] and for that cold emails and cold emails
[12:13] to CEOs of big companies or if I really
[12:15] wanted to stay in my niche of
[12:16] entrepreneurs making smaller amount of
[12:18] money then I would do to do some kind of
[12:20] like fear-based marketing to make people
[12:22] realized you could literally get banned
[12:24] from Stripe tomorrow and all your
[12:26] businesses will be closed. And that's
[12:28] the truth because this is exactly what
[12:29] happened to me. But I don't feel like
[12:31] doing this kind of marketing. Like I
[12:32] don't want to spread fear on Twitter. I
[12:34] want to spread positivity. I want to
[12:36] inspire people to do stuff. And so it's
[12:38] just not a like a funer marketing fit.
[12:41] Software number 565. Software number
[12:44] five, Zenvoice. Oh, by the way, this
[12:46] little um notification thing on the
[12:47] right side brought a lot of customers
[12:49] for this product. So what is this? Uh it
[12:52] is for people who are using Stripe and
[12:53] do not want to pay the 4% fee for every
[12:57] invoices. It is priced at $49 for one
[13:00] stripe account or $69 for unlimited
[13:02] Stripe account. I do not charge a
[13:04] recurring subscription even though it's
[13:06] costing me a few cents per month. The
[13:08] reason behind as I mentioned in other
[13:09] videos is that uh subscriptions are
[13:11] really hard to sell and I think I made
[13:13] much more money by selling one time
[13:15] payment than I would have if I were
[13:16] selling like a$5 or $10 a month
[13:18] subscription. Inside this is what the
[13:19] customer dashboard looks like. So uh
[13:21] they can just like buy dispute they can
[13:23] add uh anyone can add a new Stripe
[13:25] account right here by adding a Stripe
[13:26] API key. And then all the Stripe
[13:28] accounts will be listed right here. And
[13:30] then people will get a link that they
[13:32] can send to their customer. It looks
[13:34] like this. Uh their customers can input
[13:36] their email address right here and
[13:38] receive a magic link with uh a link to
[13:40] just download their invoices. Uh revenue
[13:42] wise, it's a newish startup. I launched
[13:45] it about a year ago. Actually, I
[13:46] launched it exactly one year ago. It
[13:49] made $15,000
[13:51] since the launch. How did I get the
[13:52] idea? And this is actually this one is
[13:55] coming out of a pure frustration. Uh
[13:57] this is one of my other stripe account
[13:59] for one of my product called ship pass.
[14:01] It is not a software. So uh the fact
[14:03] that I made $200,000 here does not
[14:05] count. But at least when I did my
[14:07] accounting thing back at the end of
[14:09] 2023, I realized that for every
[14:11] transactions on this account, I paid
[14:13] around $1 extra dollar on top of the
[14:16] Stripe fee. So, I was curious what was
[14:18] happening and I realized that if you
[14:20] activate this option in Stripe, whether
[14:22] you're using the Stripe user interface
[14:24] or using the Stripe API to create a
[14:26] checkout, Stripe will charge.4%
[14:29] per transaction just to generate a PDF
[14:32] invoice. I did the computation and
[14:34] realized I lost $1.6,000
[14:36] to generate PDF invoices. This this
[14:39] drove me mad. And just like this, I knew
[14:41] I had a new startup idea. And somehow
[14:43] this $1.6,000 $6,000 loss converted into
[14:46] $15,000 in revenue. So that's a 10x
[14:49] investment. How did I get customers? Uh
[14:51] what I did exactly a year ago again I
[14:53] started doing YouTube videos. One of the
[14:55] first thing I did on YouTube as you can
[14:57] see here streamed one year ago is to
[14:58] just stream myself building software and
[15:00] I built this entire software. So from
[15:02] day one just you know coding,
[15:04] brainstorming etc. Today I think seven
[15:07] or eight whatever launch like I did
[15:09] marketing, coding, struggling, bug
[15:11] design. I did everything in 9 days on
[15:14] this YouTube live stream. And for some
[15:15] reason YouTube pushed those videos to
[15:18] more people to developers. And just like
[15:20] that, before even launching the startup,
[15:23] I already had a few batch of customers
[15:25] who bought it because of the live
[15:26] stream. Because it was live, people
[15:27] could actually see me. They knew who was
[15:29] behind the product. This builds trust
[15:31] with customers. That's how I was able to
[15:33] make money without even having a
[15:35] product. This is a cheat code. You can
[15:37] literally right now stream yourself even
[15:39] if you don't feel comfortable with it.
[15:41] You don't even have to talk. You can
[15:43] just mention what you do in the
[15:44] description. YouTube will push your
[15:46] content out to developers because nobody
[15:48] is doing this at the moment. Make a
[15:50] beautiful visual thumbnail and you could
[15:52] get people helping you debug, design,
[15:54] and even purchase your product in the
[15:56] live stream. And the second marketing
[15:58] hack I did for this one, and it's
[16:00] driving all of the revenue at the
[16:01] moment, is adding this little badge
[16:03] right here. So every of my customers
[16:05] will get a unique link to share to their
[16:07] customers. So this page could get
[16:09] hundreds sometimes thousands of views
[16:11] and this little badge here drive a bunch
[16:13] of traffic to the website. And since
[16:15] it's driving like people who are already
[16:18] know how the product works instantly you
[16:21] I can tell what happens sometimes is
[16:22] like I have someone who sign up for
[16:24] Zenvoice. They share the link with their
[16:25] audience. They get 100 visitors and
[16:27] within the next hours I would make
[16:28] hundreds of dollars worth of sales.
[16:31] Right. S number six and my favorite
[16:33] pop-up. Uh this might sound like a joke,
[16:35] but it actually made money and and
[16:37] people are actually using it at the
[16:38] moment. Those are like pop-up
[16:40] notifications that uh you can you don't
[16:43] have to code in order to display this on
[16:45] your site. The goal here is to replicate
[16:47] what I did with Zenvoice and to catch
[16:49] attention to help whoever using poopup
[16:51] to get more conversions on the website.
[16:53] And for some reason, uh, this product
[16:55] got the attention of the CEO of Versal,
[16:58] and it has a poop emoji and the Damy's
[17:00] poop. Anyway, this is pretty much what
[17:02] the websites look like. I like to add
[17:04] little demos of how you could use the
[17:06] product that helps people know what they
[17:08] could expect from it. Uh, it is priced
[17:10] at $9 for one website and $19 for
[17:13] unlimited websites. I knew I would not
[17:16] push much updates to this product.
[17:18] That's why I also did not force
[17:19] recurring payments and I keep it with a
[17:21] onetime payment. Once you're inside, you
[17:23] have a dashboard where you can see all
[17:25] the websites you've added. Uh if we take
[17:27] this one like Zenvoice for instance,
[17:28] those are some of the notifications I
[17:30] show on the homepage. Uh you can
[17:32] customize the text inside. You can add
[17:34] uh images. You can change and make them
[17:35] clickable. You can also customize when
[17:37] they're fired, how long they stay on the
[17:39] page, and view how it would actually
[17:41] look like. Okay, now moving on to the
[17:43] revenue part. It made six a little bit
[17:46] close to $7,000.
[17:48] I launched the product back in right
[17:50] after Zenvoice actually in March 2024.
[17:53] Uh getting the idea was unique. So when
[17:57] I launched this website Zenvoice and
[17:58] people keep mentioning about those
[18:00] notifications here on the right and one
[18:02] of my friend Dan told me like bro you
[18:04] have to make a product out of it. There
[18:05] was no business mindset behind it. I
[18:07] just thought it was really fun. I
[18:09] thought it would be an easy product to
[18:10] make and I was like all right yeah let's
[18:12] do it. Uh how did I get customers for
[18:13] this one? Uh there is no secret sauce
[18:15] source. I had already a little uh
[18:18] Twitter audience. I knew it would be a
[18:21] one-time thing. Product I launch and
[18:22] then I just maintain the product and
[18:23] move on. And so I didn't bother doing
[18:25] any marketing. I did basically like a
[18:27] launch strategy where uh I went on
[18:30] product hunts and other launching
[18:32] platforms. And that's pretty much
[18:33] everything I did. There are two
[18:35] takeaways from this product. The first
[18:37] one is that it's really good to surround
[18:38] yourself with good friends because if it
[18:40] wasn't for Dan, I would not have built
[18:42] this product and I wouldn't have a story
[18:44] to tell you right now. And second is
[18:46] that every startup idea I get comes from
[18:49] the previous startups I built. So I
[18:51] would never ever even think about making
[18:54] poopup if I didn't create Zenvoice. And
[18:56] Zenvoice would not exist if my other
[18:58] onetime payment product didn't exist
[18:59] before. Everything somehow connects. And
[19:01] the only solution to get good at
[19:03] marketing and to make money online is to
[19:05] build stuff. Even though if it seems
[19:07] pointless at the beginning is to just
[19:08] create something. And that brings me to
[19:10] SAS number seven and the last one, Dataf
[19:12] Pass. It's currently in beta. It's a
[19:14] tool that I launched just 3 months ago.
[19:16] It's a web analytic tools for
[19:18] entrepreneurs to link web analytics
[19:21] traffic with their revenue data and try
[19:23] to find some insights on how to grow
[19:25] their startup. It is priced per kind of
[19:27] like traffic or events. Uh the it starts
[19:29] at 9 a month and it goes up as the
[19:31] person gets more visitors and traffic.
[19:33] Uh on the inside it looks like this. So
[19:36] it's kind of like a central dashboard uh
[19:38] where for each websites you can see in
[19:40] orange the revenue and in blue the
[19:42] traffic and then for any website it's
[19:45] going to uh link those data. So for
[19:47] instance I can see that on that day I
[19:49] got 2.4,000 visitors and made almost
[19:51] $1.5,000. It's going to calculate some
[19:54] metrics like revenue per visitor
[19:56] conversion rate. It's also going to link
[19:58] the revenue to which traffic source
[20:00] people are coming from. Uh same for the
[20:02] country browser etc. Okay. Now,
[20:05] revenue-wise, it's an early uh product
[20:07] because it's been only 3 months, but it
[20:08] made almost $6,000 so far. This is what
[20:12] the Stripe dashboard looks like. Uh the
[20:14] monthly recuring revenue is at one
[20:16] almost $1.4,000 and it keeps growing up
[20:18] while the subscriber turn rate is going
[20:21] down. Uh this is potentially explained
[20:23] because this is where I'm putting 80 or
[20:25] 90% of my focus at the moment. How did I
[20:27] get this idea? Well, it's very simple
[20:29] and it's exactly the same way I got
[20:31] ideas for most of my product. It come
[20:34] from a personal need. Since I have built
[20:36] now all of those tiny internet
[20:38] businesses in the past three years, I
[20:40] need to have a place to centralize
[20:42] everything and having web analytics is a
[20:44] great thing, but if it doesn't connect
[20:46] with payment data, it's kind of useless.
[20:48] And I yet haven't found a good solution
[20:50] that's easy to use, sexy, and that
[20:52] connects a web and and payment data. So,
[20:54] I just build it myself. And now talking
[20:56] about getting customers, uh since the
[20:58] product is very new, it is hard for me
[21:00] to confidently tell you what's working,
[21:02] what's not working. What I'm doing at
[21:03] the moment, I'm building this SAS
[21:05] publicly on Twitter. So, this is how I
[21:07] got my early customers. And I'm also
[21:09] trying a new marketing strategy that
[21:11] I've never tried before. That's Mr. R Y
[21:14] seems to be working well so far, but I
[21:16] will keep that for another video. Just
[21:18] before I let you go, I wanted to share
[21:19] with you three tips I've learned along
[21:21] the way and as well as show you the
[21:23] revenue for my other three SAS that are
[21:25] now disconnected. Here they are. This is
[21:27] what I made with those other software.
[21:29] So, Viralbot is a project I started back
[21:31] in 2018 when there was no one sharing uh
[21:34] info about how to make money as a
[21:36] developer on the internet. I had no idea
[21:37] what I was doing. I was learning how to
[21:39] code. It took me years to grow the
[21:41] software. Uh I finally reached at some
[21:42] point, I think over 4,000 in monthly
[21:44] recurring revenue, which I was really
[21:46] happy of, but the marketing was
[21:47] extremely boring. I was sending cold
[21:49] email to uh cold businesses. And that's
[21:51] the entire marketing strategy. If you
[21:53] think it's worth a YouTube video, let me
[21:54] know and I'll create one. Uh then the
[21:56] next one is game widget which made
[21:57] $4.5,000.
[21:59] Uh this is
[22:00] Hey, my name is Mark. I am the creator
[22:02] of the game widget. And in this quick,
[22:04] this is me. Like this is a demo of me
[22:06] back in 20 I think 21. I was awkward. I
[22:08] was shy. I didn't know what I was doing.
[22:10] I was really bad at marketing. I had no
[22:12] idea how to sell anything. I built like
[22:14] this uh little widgets that would sit on
[22:17] a website to increase conversion rate of
[22:18] a website. I made $200 with the product.
[22:20] I sold it for $4.3,000.
[22:23] And finally, make lending. This one,
[22:25] it's a website generator using AI. It's
[22:28] like basically you input text and the
[22:30] the SAS will create an entire website
[22:32] for you. I made around $15,000
[22:35] in revenue, I think, in three to four
[22:37] months. And then I sold it for $35,000
[22:40] because I just had no idea how to grow
[22:41] the product. All right. Now, three
[22:43] takeaways from this. The first one is
[22:45] that you don't need a brilliant startup
[22:47] idea to get started. It's actually a
[22:49] trap. Stop looking for ideas. Instead,
[22:51] go build something. build just anything.
[22:53] Either try something new like a new
[22:55] hobby, a new sport. Go talk to some new
[22:57] people and think about a potential app
[22:58] idea that you could use along this way.
[23:00] And if you still have no idea, just
[23:02] rebuild something that you already use.
[23:04] Rebuild your habit tracker, rebuild your
[23:06] alarm clock, whatever it is, build
[23:08] something because it's by building stuff
[23:10] that you will discover real problems
[23:13] that people will be willing to pay for.
[23:14] Number two, find the right marketing
[23:16] channel. This is so important. I burned
[23:18] out back in 2018 because I was doing
[23:21] marketing the wrong way. I was like
[23:22] sending cold emails to cold businesses
[23:23] and it was so boring. Now that I found
[23:26] marketing with programmatic SEO,
[23:27] building free tools, making fun launch
[23:29] viral videos. This is making me happy.
[23:32] If you think the product has some
[23:33] potential, but you don't know how the
[23:34] marketing, just just move on to the next
[23:36] one. Find a product where marketing does
[23:38] not feel like marketing. And finally,
[23:40] number three is learn when to quit. I
[23:42] see lots of people spending like a month
[23:44] building something and then months
[23:46] trying to grow it without getting
[23:47] significant numbers. There's a little
[23:49] voice inside of our head called
[23:50] expectations. The longer you spend on
[23:52] something, the higher your expectations.
[23:54] And if the results never meet your
[23:56] expectation, at some point you will just
[23:58] burn out. Now that I have built over 30
[24:00] tiny businesses, there's one thing I
[24:02] noticed is that whenever I launched
[24:03] after getting a,000 visitors, I know
[24:06] instantly whether or not this product
[24:08] could be a good fit. All right, that's
[24:10] the end of this video. Now, if you're a
[24:11] developer and you want to avoid some of
[24:13] the common mistake I see other
[24:14] developers make, you can watch this
[24:16] video. And if you're just getting
[24:17] inspired and you want to learn how to
[24:18] code, I made this three hours long video
[24:21] to learn how to code an entire software
[24:23] from zero. Just make me a promise after
[24:25] this video. Do not watch another video.
[24:27] Go build something. Cheers.
