[04:18] grow and and whatever
[04:21] um okay we are
[04:23] this is a setup for today
[04:26] a coffee cup he makes me nervous me too
[04:34] Argentina Sunday afternoon nice man oh I
[04:37] was skating yesterday with a bunch of
[04:39] Argentinian people you like your people
[04:42] from the country are just so friendly
[04:43] man
[04:47] this is squirrel in the tree
[04:50] a little squirrel running
[04:53] Argentina Amsterdam oh
[04:57] you know yeah it's getting late for you
[05:01] all right
[05:02] um okay so where are we we um
[05:06] so this is what has have been done
[05:08] yesterday
[05:12] um these are the goals for today
[05:15] so the app right now it's a very ugly
[05:19] landing page but this there's a sign up
[05:21] process and pretty much everything is
[05:23] working
[05:24] um people can log in and sign up with
[05:26] Google or their emails
[05:29] um this is the app as it is uh you have
[05:33] your account you can complete your uh
[05:36] whatever workout that you're doing you
[05:38] can add more Sports avatars set up your
[05:41] goal
[05:43] um
[05:44] you can edit your stuff if you want to
[05:47] complete you gain some experience and
[05:49] your avatar is growing
[05:52] this is a leaderboard for people who are
[05:54] level three
[05:55] and um as I grow into levels uh I will
[05:59] see different people from different
[06:00] levels
[06:01] there is a payment system in the app
[06:03] already that's working
[06:06] um I think this account yeah this
[06:08] account is a free account so if I want
[06:10] to create more than one Avatar I'll need
[06:12] I'll need a another subscription a
[06:15] one-time payment
[06:17] so on the web we do this through stripe
[06:20] links uh if I pay here it's going to
[06:22] send an event to my API and the API will
[06:25] update the user accounts and let the
[06:27] user access the premium features
[06:30] and on the
[06:34] on the the the native apps
[06:39] um I'm gonna run it
[06:41] so the app is using capacitor which
[06:43] helped me turn this app that you just
[06:46] saw
[06:47] into a native app
[06:50] which I'm going to show in a second yeah
[06:52] there we go so that's the app on iPhone
[06:54] it's pretty much the same on Android as
[06:57] well
[06:58] it is working uh fine we have a native
[07:01] payment system for users
[07:04] or maybe it just need notifications
[07:08] um
[07:09] and this is working so I've submitted
[07:11] the app I think on Saturday so two days
[07:13] ago for me and I haven't checked the
[07:16] stores so I don't know how is it going
[07:18] and I'm gonna check live with you so
[07:19] this is the app on Android and this is
[07:20] the app on iOS it's still pending review
[07:24] it's Saturday so I mean it was on the
[07:26] weekend so it's probably still a pending
[07:27] review but still we're gonna check
[07:33] and we're gonna refresh
[07:36] see where are we on okay so still we're
[07:39] still waiting for review
[07:43] um oops no that's the wrong app it was
[07:46] still waiting for review and for this
[07:48] one
[07:50] on Android we're still in review
[07:56] Activia in review okay
[08:01] so
[08:02] going back to the to-do list
[08:05] um the goal we are on day six so today
[08:07] and tomorrow are supposed to be the last
[08:09] days for this mini startup to be
[08:11] launched
[08:13] um if we got accepted on the stores I
[08:15] hope I can stream the product time to
[08:17] launch after tomorrow but basically
[08:19] those two days will be focused on mainly
[08:23] two things
[08:24] the first one and today will be the last
[08:26] day of coding we need to finish the
[08:28] landing page because again
[08:30] the landing page is this
[08:32] so with this landing page definitely
[08:34] needs some work you can actually put it
[08:37] first
[08:41] um also we have a little issue on mobile
[08:43] with the viewport so I need to fix this
[08:46] this is important
[08:48] this is probably a note for myself it's
[08:51] not needed here
[08:54] um and then so that's probably two days
[08:56] ago this is probably two days goals and
[08:59] I think I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do
[09:01] next
[09:04] uh maybe last day
[09:07] we're gonna do
[09:09] so we're gonna do the product demo video
[09:11] so this is not going to be a coding day
[09:14] I'm just gonna be somewhere in my uh in
[09:18] my apartment uh shooting the video for
[09:20] the product hunts I was it's an app
[09:23] where you grow a workout Avatar as you
[09:26] complete your workouts
[09:28] so I was thinking uh the rock the public
[09:31] personality could be a fun person to
[09:33] make a prank video with
[09:35] so I'll check some videos of him with
[09:37] Kevin Hart and see if I can get some
[09:39] nice clips and make a short video that I
[09:41] will use for the product hunt launch but
[09:44] this is not a coding tomorrow will not
[09:45] be a cutting day it's just going to be
[09:46] me shooting videos and uh I don't know
[09:49] if that's interesting
[09:50] um if it is uh I'm happy otherwise it's
[09:52] just you'll see guys some weird stuff
[09:55] and if this is done by tomorrow and if I
[09:58] have all the meta stuff I need like
[10:00] pictures and and screenshots for the
[10:03] launch on product tones
[10:05] um then I'm gonna move on and I'm
[10:07] probably gonna do notifications like the
[10:09] local notifications where you can send
[10:10] daily reminders to track your workouts
[10:13] so you don't forget
[10:15] and at the end a public profile where
[10:17] you can have a profile where people can
[10:19] see all your workout avatars those are a
[10:22] bit ambitious but who knows if we finish
[10:25] earlier today we maybe can jump on those
[10:28] things
[10:30] um yeah so we're gonna start coding
[10:32] landing page stuff
[10:35] um
[10:36] this is the live app if you guys want to
[10:38] trade actually
[10:40] you can try the landing page is not
[10:42] there but you can actually sign up and
[10:43] go to the app and and play with it
[10:48] um okay okay okay okay I think we can
[10:51] close the stores
[10:53] um also we need oh yeah we have a login
[10:55] with Google and this on mobile needs to
[10:57] be approved
[10:59] and I've already done that so I'm just
[11:02] waiting
[11:03] for Google to approve my
[11:06] um login with Google stuff
[11:08] so I'm gonna wait for this
[11:13] and moving on uh
[11:17] stuff
[11:19] so good
[11:22] all right if you guys are have been
[11:25] following the stream at the very
[11:27] beginning of the journey
[11:29] we had like a very ugly app
[11:32] that that I designed
[11:35] um
[11:36] it was green and that's super cool and
[11:38] there's a guy this amazing guy uh
[11:46] yep
[11:48] yeah these guys
[11:50] um
[11:53] if you guys are into design or something
[11:56] he turned he just tuned up on the stream
[11:59] and he just made this he created those
[12:02] amazing screens
[12:04] of how the app would look like if he
[12:07] designed it
[12:09] and I just took inspiration so I just
[12:11] um basically the whole app looks great
[12:14] now thanks to him
[12:16] so I just copy past what he did and he
[12:18] also sent me a few meta like uh for the
[12:22] social stuff so social sharing
[12:27] so now what's happening if I share the
[12:29] app on Twitter
[12:32] um
[12:34] oops
[12:35] if I share it on Twitter
[12:39] supposed to show me the card
[12:42] yep
[12:43] you're supposed to shoot me the card
[12:45] Twitter no
[12:48] maybe you made that
[12:51] all right do not have the meta tags I
[12:53] think this one could be important
[12:56] no we have it I think just Twitter is
[12:57] being lazy
[12:59] or maybe we don't have it on the social
[13:02] stuff
[13:06] um maybe we could just use a Facebook
[13:08] debugger
[13:12] I'm checking uh you know what people
[13:14] would see if they share the car the link
[13:25] okay it seems to be working grow your
[13:27] workout avatars
[13:31] all right what do you guys think
[13:33] um I have two options here this is the
[13:35] stuff I designed so if I share a private
[13:38] link to a friend this is what my friend
[13:40] will see
[13:41] um and on the other hand I have the work
[13:43] from uh Manu who sent me this that I
[13:48] could actually use
[13:52] so either we could have this card or
[13:56] the king
[13:59] I was talking about you bro I'm actually
[14:02] thinking um
[14:05] replace the car the
[14:07] image I have when I show the link to
[14:10] friends to the one you sent me
[14:13] that looks freaking awesome
[14:18] the one I'm thinking about okay
[14:20] there we go
[14:22] actually this is very simple
[14:26] way too simple okay the one on the thing
[14:28] [Music]
[14:33] foreign
[14:39] actually I think I like the name better
[14:41] the way you wrote it because for me the
[14:43] app name was hero fit
[14:45] I think it makes more sense like this
[14:51] okay any preference anyone
[14:54] um maybe we can just pull them
[15:02] I'm gonna zoom on the screen
[15:21] right you can
[15:24] not make this smaller in this same I
[15:27] gotta make it smaller
[15:29] okay
[15:31] what do we have
[15:48] all right you can just say whatever one
[15:51] you prefer top one
[15:54] uh top right bottom right whatever
[16:04] I think for me my favorite would be this
[16:07] one
[16:07] because it's
[16:09] trophy it's somehow reminds of a
[16:14] leagues and stuff it feels like
[16:17] whatever feels like I'm competing
[16:21] separate
[16:23] but I'm right oh [ __ ] it's good my
[16:27] bottom right bottom right but I'm right
[16:29] top right top right
[16:30] we have
[16:32] two top right and three bottom right
[16:35] let's pull those a bit bigger
[16:41] those are actually exactly the same
[16:44] despite this emoji
[16:52] okay
[16:54] because your Mains are green Avatar but
[16:56] I'm not super openated
[16:59] all right Ellie the designer said bottom
[17:02] right we go for bottom right
[17:04] oh maybe I just need to put the right
[17:05] size for it so those are what I'm using
[17:08] for oh yeah this is how the app looked
[17:10] like before menus work
[17:15] so the color and everything was changed
[17:18] um
[17:20] oh this is what you did okay oh nice man
[17:29] okay I get it
[17:31] here you are
[17:34] um so we're gonna change this
[17:39] all right so I need to
[17:41] um I need to check what you just did
[17:43] here
[17:45] I'm gonna put it around here
[17:59] I think I can
[18:02] or agreed
[18:08] I'm going to struggle
[18:12] or dimension for this
[18:17] maybe I'm gonna try something a bit
[18:19] dirty
[18:21] unload
[18:22] and I'm gonna put it in back somewhere
[18:24] here
[18:36] all right it's a bit dirty it's just I
[18:38] need a specific size for those cards
[18:42] so yeah
[18:46] okay I think that works
[18:50] um and I'm gonna put it in the project
[18:52] hero feed
[18:53] oblique I'm gonna replace what I have
[19:01] ngu
[19:03] here it is and we're gonna make it just
[19:06] a little bit smaller
[19:10] okay so normally we have it here
[19:15] all right this is live
[19:25] okay
[19:33] okay let's go for the for the design of
[19:37] the landing page I think it's going to
[19:39] be a very simple one
[19:42] I need my console somewhere I need my
[19:44] Dev server it's here
[19:47] okay index page so this is the landing
[19:50] page
[19:52] I'm gonna go back to the localhost
[19:56] um
[19:58] so we will need a login button somewhere
[20:02] terrific great workout avatars oh no
[20:09] um max with three Excel and makes Auto
[20:18] cutting forward
[20:20] okay
[20:24] um yeah I think for the landing page I'm
[20:26] just gonna have
[20:28] something super simple the top of the
[20:31] fold
[20:32] with a demo of the product somehow I
[20:34] think I'm gonna let people play with
[20:35] images or something then
[20:38] foreign
[20:39] ly going deeper into the problem so like
[20:42] explain why sticking to work out is hard
[20:44] and how making it fun with game is a way
[20:48] to help you be more consistent and then
[20:51] I think I'm gonna have two or three like
[20:53] little blocks that shows features of the
[20:56] app the leaderboard part the fact that
[20:57] you're growing your avatar and the fact
[20:59] that oh that's an important part I did
[21:01] yesterday as well every day the database
[21:05] is being checked and if your avatar has
[21:07] not been updated within the last seven
[21:10] days you can start losing some
[21:11] experience points so it'll shrink
[21:13] so that's something I want to talk about
[21:15] in the landing page as well
[21:17] and probably a pricing page because
[21:20] there is a paid version of the app
[21:24] and whatever some footer links or
[21:27] anything
[21:29] yours now
[21:31] you must admitted just curious to know
[21:33] if there's a reason use capacitor versus
[21:34] react native uh yeah there is a very I
[21:37] actually wanted to learn react native
[21:39] and I'm using capacitor uh because these
[21:42] same another Legend not for the design
[21:45] part but for the coding part this guy
[21:48] here
[21:51] um he told me that I should be using
[21:53] capacitor
[21:54] and he helped me turn my first app into
[21:57] a native app with capacitor and he took
[22:00] in less than two weeks I went from
[22:02] having no idea how things work on the
[22:05] app stores and everything I've never had
[22:06] an app shipped before
[22:08] and capacitor allowed me to turn it into
[22:10] an app and being live on the store in 15
[22:13] days
[22:14] and I I wanted to learn react native
[22:16] this year
[22:17] and just
[22:19] um it's like it's I think direct native
[22:22] is awesome but it's just like you have
[22:23] to learn a whole new language
[22:26] and I think that would have taken much
[22:28] more time
[22:29] and that's why this be it's mainly a
[22:31] reason for like speed to Market that I
[22:33] decided to learn capacitor and now I
[22:36] have three apps shipped on the stores
[22:37] and I learned earlier this year so I'm
[22:40] definitely no regret
[22:43] yay
[22:45] Series 3 Jason is going to do pretty
[22:47] good 3GS I have no idea what that is I
[22:50] usually code them from scratch
[22:55] oh it's a it's animation something
[23:01] for Minecraft
[23:03] oh the okay those are examples
[23:07] I hope uh well if you have any idea of
[23:11] how I could use this library to make it
[23:13] fun
[23:15] um if you're free to share it man for
[23:16] now I think I don't have any special ID
[23:19] I think I'm just gonna make the hero
[23:21] like something your benefits with the
[23:23] call to actions and the buttons to the
[23:25] source
[23:26] then I wanted to make a so for the demo
[23:28] for the app I think either I can make a
[23:31] video that auto plays that shows your
[23:34] workout growing and creating new Avatar
[23:36] like basically someone using the app
[23:38] in a fast motion
[23:40] or other option
[23:44] I just copy what I did here I removed
[23:48] the leaderboard I just clicked the Emoji
[23:51] and I let people complete their workouts
[23:53] throw some competees
[23:56] and grow the Avatar and because it's a
[23:58] demo you could you would be able to go
[24:00] from Level zero to level 10 by just
[24:03] clicking 10 times
[24:05] pretty much like I did for habits Garden
[24:10] uh
[24:13] um we could have something like this
[24:15] where you know you could
[24:16] test the app
[24:20] let's see let's see I'm going to set up
[24:22] the the layout for now
[24:26] we're going to have a section in this
[24:29] section would have
[24:32] um a header maybe you know the H1
[24:35] uh gamify your workouts
[24:41] and we're gonna have a second text
[24:45] um
[24:49] create workout create
[24:53] Live It Up
[24:55] your
[24:58] workouts atars
[25:01] is sticky
[25:21] level up your workout Avatar
[25:24] maybe just take the stick to your balls
[25:28] to level up your workout avatars and
[25:31] climb
[25:34] beat the rewards
[25:43] okay uh we're gonna have a sections with
[25:46] buttons
[25:48] um
[25:58] maybe we have a link to the stores I'm
[26:00] gonna copy that
[26:02] which app are we
[26:06] um index page I'm just gonna take the
[26:10] App Store and Play Store badges I use
[26:13] for my other apps
[26:19] um I think that's the one
[26:24] that's the one we're gonna put it
[26:26] somewhere
[26:28] here
[26:30] we need image
[26:34] from next we also need
[26:43] public
[26:45] I'll need to copy past those two
[26:49] uh I have the logos already for the
[26:52] store so I'm gonna take it from other
[26:53] apps
[26:55] um public
[26:57] badge okay I'm gonna use those two and
[27:00] I'm gonna put them in here
[27:05] ready right
[27:10] um probably true object contained done
[27:13] on the App Store App Store badge
[27:16] oh yeah we need the links from the
[27:17] stores uh in the config file
[27:22] stores iOS
[27:25] and Android
[27:29] I'm gonna have to go back here pick the
[27:31] links
[27:32] Store Play Store
[27:35] getting hot here in Bali
[27:37] it's 7 30 a.m and I feel like it's
[27:39] already 35 degrees
[27:43] so nope that's not the right app
[27:49] Rove it
[27:52] View
[27:54] the Android link and the iOS
[27:59] link
[28:07] where can I have information maybe
[28:12] yeah store
[28:17] terrific gamify is that the I think it's
[28:19] the right one to use it's G fate when I
[28:23] use on habit's Garden
[28:35] I don't remember
[28:41] is that correct stuff
[28:44] uh
[28:46] the US apparel
[28:48] that is curtain and then there is the ID
[28:50] okay I think that's the right one yeah
[28:52] okay
[28:54] so app stores iOS link Android link
[28:59] and here config app stores iOS
[29:02] run over okay
[29:05] we import the badges okay that should
[29:08] work nope it does work because I didn't
[29:11] import the config fight
[29:16] okay I have the link to the stores
[29:21] sorry my new I missed your message
[29:29] I don't know I don't know if that's your
[29:32] actual name but uh I think just go with
[29:34] what you used to
[29:36] that works well
[29:41] oh yeah yeah definitely check it out
[29:47] the Hero season replies the line
[29:50] with the flowers by the Avatar sport car
[29:53] yeah yeah yeah 100 bro
[29:55] what I'm gonna do here
[29:57] I was just thinking um so you think it's
[29:59] better to have a demo where you could
[30:01] click and grow an avatar and when you
[30:04] reach level 10 you will just swipe your
[30:06] avatar for another one and you just keep
[30:08] playing with it
[30:09] or do you think I should make a video a
[30:11] square video
[30:12] that shows the use of the app I think
[30:15] yeah I'll let you think about it
[30:20] nope I mean
[30:22] look this is where I am this is the
[30:24] setup
[30:25] this is my little garden
[30:28] uh yeah I mean Indonesia Bali in my
[30:32] little uh
[30:35] or using a hybrid Guardian with the
[30:38] little profit between the Stars on your
[30:39] landing page I've seen it before I think
[30:41] I'd say I think
[30:43] I don't know uh
[30:47] Roby I think I just use whatever I could
[30:52] if you're talking about this I'm it's a
[30:55] designer made from scratch it's not
[30:56] perfect
[30:58] the Stars I think those are hero icons
[31:00] and and this is something I coded
[31:05] okay so give me free workouts don't know
[31:07] get in the Play Store and also we want
[31:09] to link for
[31:11] uh start here
[31:14] we want some kind of Link
[31:16] or people who don't want to download the
[31:19] app
[31:21] and the link go to app will be somewhere
[31:23] else oh we have a section here which is
[31:26] I guess is going to be a header
[31:30] [Music]
[31:31] um
[31:32] where we need
[31:33] a div with the app name
[31:36] and here we're going to have a login
[31:38] button
[31:42] um
[31:45] actually no it's going to be a link
[31:49] href equal
[31:53] uh login
[31:56] this is going to be a button button
[31:59] ghosts
[32:03] and here
[32:04] we have we're gonna need the logo so I'm
[32:07] gonna use the image
[32:11] and the image will pull the logo from
[32:16] our public stuff
[32:20] logo.png
[32:22] is it import import
[32:26] you go
[32:31] we're gonna get the logo here
[32:35] um profit logo should I rename the app
[32:39] hero fit with no space in between or
[32:41] just keep hero fit
[32:43] the the sorry if it's not clear the
[32:46] question is this one should I do hero
[32:49] bits
[32:52] or
[32:54] hero bits
[32:58] I don't know if I should link them or
[33:01] just separate them
[33:03] I don't know if I'm not sure this is big
[33:06] deal I think it's important
[33:13] no I just fondled
[33:22] okay uh for the image we are going to
[33:26] do with uh maybe 14.
[33:31] rounded Excel
[33:33] shadow
[33:35] LG
[33:37] you just feel like it's an app
[33:39] it can work
[33:42] um here we're gonna do Lex yeah two
[33:45] my name is Cena
[33:53] maybe it's a bit too big maybe just 12
[33:56] and here we're gonna do Texas LG
[34:00] all right
[34:03] uh and then here in the header we want
[34:06] Flex
[34:10] justify between
[34:16] maybe just a button
[34:21] yeah that's not perfect we'll gonna
[34:22] we're gonna see how that goes after
[34:28] um for now I'm gonna do something
[34:30] like this just to make it Little Bits
[34:33] more space everywhere
[34:35] let me find your workouts
[34:38] last text
[34:39] per pixels
[34:41] black
[34:44] wrecking tight
[34:47] even we can go 5xl
[34:50] give me five workouts
[34:52] your class text LG
[34:56] that section would have a space y 8
[35:00] probably
[35:03] this is
[35:05] way too big
[35:07] margin bottom
[35:15] eight give me a workouts
[35:23] doing oh
[35:26] nice
[35:31] mlks
[35:34] zero fits
[35:36] okay
[35:38] it's hard to read the vs good taste like
[35:40] the stream is oh yeah
[35:48] oh yeah correct
[35:52] um
[35:56] again here repeat gamify your workouts
[35:58] take your goals to level up your workout
[36:00] avatars and climb the leaderboards
[36:03] Bingo dingo to go
[36:04] maybe the start here button should be
[36:08] a bit less
[36:13] um
[36:17] this will be dirty
[36:22] picture
[36:24] do we no actually it's gonna be a big
[36:28] one
[36:38] um
[36:46] that's a good point how do other ABS do
[36:49] that
[36:56] uh
[37:06] see you guys now
[37:08] it started
[37:19] oh maybe we just have one call to action
[37:21] and we detect whether the user is on
[37:24] mobile
[37:40] maybe make the weightlifting look very
[37:42] much interactive when someone
[37:43] accidentally click on it
[37:46] you can do something like this uh
[37:50] over
[37:52] animates
[37:54] we're gonna read a
[37:56] pop-up
[37:58] boom boom boom
[38:01] fine
[38:36] I'm Gonna Leave This for now until I uh
[38:38] come up with something smarter
[38:40] let's do the demo
[38:43] um this is going to be another div
[38:55] so we want a little Avatar with a button
[38:59] that says
[39:01] me or whatever
[39:03] and then when you tick you're gonna have
[39:04] comfort tea Avatar will grow grow grow
[39:06] grow and then when you reach a certain
[39:08] level I'll swept your avatar and I will
[39:11] give you whatever other Avatar
[39:15] I think they can be fun
[39:18] um so that can be something like this uh
[39:21] it would just the first avatar will be
[39:24] this one
[39:30] okay
[39:33] um and you're gonna have a button to
[39:36] grow the avatar
[39:38] through me
[39:40] plus button button ghost
[39:47] and we're going to do a text Center
[39:54] space
[39:57] or
[39:58] two
[40:01] okay
[40:02] [Music]
[40:02] um
[40:05] click grow Avatar
[40:12] constant grow Avatar
[40:14] what is this thing going to do
[40:16] I think we can import we have a list of
[40:20] avatars already this one
[40:24] are all the avatars available in the app
[40:25] so maybe I'm gonna import it
[40:28] import the list
[40:35] and we're gonna use the weight lifter as
[40:38] a default so we'll need also use states
[40:41] to keep the avatar
[40:45] crack
[40:46] um
[40:47] Sports
[40:51] these states
[40:53] um I'm gonna do least zero I guess a
[40:57] little lifter
[41:00] okay
[41:03] uh maybe I'm just gonna do in case it
[41:05] changes ID
[41:07] enture
[41:16] it's Sports
[41:17] wait uh weight lifter
[41:22] um and we're going to do sport.emoji
[41:26] here
[41:29] or dot emoji okay
[41:34] um
[41:37] right what else we need the class as
[41:39] well the game
[41:42] um we're gonna we're gonna need a little
[41:44] function that calculates the current XP
[41:46] for the user
[41:49] so we're going to export levels
[41:53] and level
[41:58] Imports
[41:59] levels
[42:02] and also get current level
[42:15] set level
[42:19] by default we're going to start level
[42:21] one right get one
[42:26] and then we're gonna do level dot class
[42:29] name
[42:31] or Mr Avatar
[42:40] level dot class name
[42:45] uh and grow Avatar we're going to do
[42:53] we have nothing that tracks the current
[42:57] XP so we're gonna do constants
[43:01] XP
[43:05] oh actually we don't need that
[43:08] okay wait anyway it says XP
[43:12] you state you're gonna start with zero
[43:15] XP
[43:16] and here we're gonna get get current
[43:19] level
[43:22] yeah I did a mistake so we're gonna have
[43:26] hit current level
[43:29] uh and I think you pass XP yep that's
[43:33] what I did
[43:34] current level XP and we don't need this
[43:37] anymore
[43:40] okay if I put 100xp
[43:45] it does work
[43:47] everything running
[43:51] uh XP get current levels oh probably get
[43:54] current level dots
[43:57] [Music]
[43:57] um
[43:58] what is it last name here
[44:07] I'm just going to console log that thing
[44:10] get current level you return
[44:13] your return oh oh yeah okay
[44:16] so you you return the level I am
[44:21] I give you the XP and you give me the
[44:23] level
[44:25] and then I need to get the level by the
[44:27] level
[44:39] at least I tried
[44:42] really gets here
[44:44] I'm gonna do a we're going to console
[44:46] log
[44:56] what are we getting back from here
[45:08] level four okay that makes sense
[45:10] level four
[45:12] so now you need to tell me
[45:17] this is supposed to be working no it's
[45:20] level by level
[45:24] yeah it's working
[45:26] what did I do wrong then
[45:30] hit Level by level
[45:33] and then you just put a little class
[45:34] name here
[45:38] why wasn't working what did it do
[45:40] home components reference get level Baza
[45:43] is oh
[45:45] oh I didn't import it okay
[45:49] okay then I give you the class name
[45:51] which normally should grow your avatar
[45:54] okay
[45:56] it takes oh yeah
[46:02] uh and here if I give you a thousand XP
[46:05] you're supposed to grow congratulations
[46:09] okay
[46:13] so I got my emoji here which is very
[46:15] small and every time we grow XP we're
[46:17] gonna do
[46:19] um
[46:21] all right we'll need we need companies
[46:25] this is the most important part
[46:28] app
[46:30] I know it's index
[46:32] I'm pretty
[46:34] those are the companies we need
[46:37] and how do we throw the competes we
[46:39] throw them this way
[46:44] um
[46:51] yay
[46:54] all right let's throw some companies and
[46:57] we are going to
[47:00] get you more XP
[47:02] um
[47:03] sets XP
[47:06] we're gonna do previous state
[47:10] previous state Plus
[47:15] a much xp the first level is
[47:21] the first level is
[47:25] an XP so maybe
[47:27] when he explained it see how
[47:37] okay
[47:38] oh yeah I need to get the page
[47:45] uh
[47:47] I'm just gonna get the Avatar that class
[47:50] name
[47:51] duration 1000
[47:57] yeah duration 1000 let's go
[48:01] you are here bro
[48:04] yeah
[48:07] the nominee should grow but a little bit
[48:13] okay we need to throw less comfort in
[48:15] maybe send more
[48:17] XP uh 30 and confetti maybe we're gonna
[48:21] remove it
[48:24] um too nerdy
[48:26] red 50.
[48:28] it was pretty actually it was nice
[48:36] oh maybe no maybe we just need to throw
[48:38] a comfy when you level up
[48:40] okay that makes more sense
[48:46] um
[48:58] extra experience equal 30.
[49:05] foreign
[49:13] XP
[49:21] level
[49:26] if get level by level
[49:29] of git
[49:32] double
[49:39] Oh no just just to get the current level
[49:43] if you get your if the current XP
[49:47] is
[49:48] [Music]
[49:48] um
[49:54] if it's smaller then get current level
[49:59] at XP plus extra EXP
[50:02] then we throw some companies
[50:06] normally it should not throw some coffee
[50:09] oh but grow me doesn't make sense then
[50:15] it only gonna send comforties
[50:19] oh yeah I think a maximum level already
[50:28] yeah it only sends the company
[50:31] and I level up right that doesn't make
[50:33] much sense
[50:41] yo Federico yo Camille
[50:47] good time you should keep doing these
[50:49] videos
[51:00] good idea for the app I need a game
[51:02] before I workout you get
[51:04] the data from that no I don't get the
[51:06] data from Strava I just user click to
[51:09] add a data number of clicks on grow me
[51:12] you're redirected to the app you create
[51:14] your avatar
[51:18] a rarity George is a man nice
[51:29] [Music]
[51:30] um
[51:32] maybe okay maybe I'm gonna display the
[51:35] level maybe that will make more sense
[51:40] oh yeah that's why I need to read
[51:45] um
[51:47] oh yeah I think I need okay and I know
[51:49] what I need I need to
[51:51] have a mini design of the app I think I
[51:54] need to show
[51:56] um
[51:58] go to app
[52:00] I think the demo still needs to have
[52:03] level two
[52:04] and this and this it doesn't make sense
[52:07] for people to just click to grow
[52:10] something
[52:11] yeah
[52:12] exactly that's yeah
[52:16] um
[52:18] that we're gonna
[52:19] feel the code from this
[52:22] the card
[52:31] all right now we need to change all the
[52:34] little details
[52:37] uh creation
[52:40] bottom Auto
[52:43] hit current
[52:58] okay the sports Emoji we're gonna keep
[53:01] this one
[53:04] and level by level
[53:18] and uh
[53:21] we need a tracker for this as well that
[53:23] takes place sets
[53:26] um
[53:29] score set score
[53:36] let's score
[53:51] um
[53:59] we need to grow this core and here we're
[54:01] going to call it score
[54:09] we don't need the link to the settings
[54:13] we don't have a name for the avatar
[54:18] just for the record we're going to keep
[54:20] it empty blah blah
[54:23] the progress bar will be so XP
[54:28] and here will be
[54:33] it
[54:34] current level
[54:38] dot XP
[54:40] required
[54:46] I'll be the max
[54:49] and here
[54:51] we have XP divided by
[54:57] the same number
[55:03] here once again next level XP required I
[55:07] hope this is going to work
[55:09] of course not s is not defined
[55:17] 810
[55:20] oh yeah
[55:24] there's dots
[55:30] I can remove this guy
[55:41] okay something is going on this is not
[55:43] working but at least
[55:48] all right now is something working
[55:50] somehow
[55:53] um
[55:54] not everything so
[55:56] the progress the max value I think
[56:01] oh okay get level by level and here we
[56:04] need to do plus one
[56:09] yeah
[56:10] and I guess it's going to be the same
[56:12] for
[56:15] p
[56:17] uh yep same here
[56:24] and here same as well
[56:26] because we need to show the next level
[56:27] oh yeah okay that makes sense and then
[56:29] the guy will slowly grow
[56:33] that's addictive
[56:37] all right and here it's [ __ ] up
[56:38] because there is no more next level
[56:42] um oh yeah so that's the part when we
[56:44] grow the Avatar we need at some point
[56:49] uh
[56:52] we just need a little function that says
[56:55] if
[57:00] your current level what's going to
[57:01] happen if we are too much hit current
[57:05] level
[57:08] you know what I'm just going to test it
[57:09] and let's see
[57:11] console log
[57:13] what are you gonna show me
[57:18] start level four oh yeah because I
[57:19] already said okay
[57:21] don't even start this way
[57:23] that's
[57:24] I F4
[57:29] 50
[57:31] and you're gonna show me 10 11 okay
[57:38] I just need a function that check uh if
[57:40] we don't go over the current the maximum
[57:43] level
[57:44] uh which is this one here
[57:48] oh cancel the cloud
[57:51] these at some point you will return 11.
[57:53] but there is no more level after that
[57:58] maybe we just need uh
[58:03] we do something like Eve
[58:06] hit current level plus x-ray speed it's
[58:08] Superior to or equal what's the size of
[58:11] this level one two three four five
[58:12] eleven
[58:15] so if it's super
[58:17] to level that length so if there's no
[58:21] more level left word
[58:22] or we grow
[58:25] so this is what we do here
[58:29] dingo
[58:32] um
[58:33] and what we're going to do we're going
[58:35] to replace the Avatar in that case
[58:38] and Sport
[58:42] said Sports
[58:45] set score we're gonna do we're gonna go
[58:47] for zero
[58:52] set XP we're gonna go for zero as well
[58:57] um in the sports we're going to do get
[59:00] Sports
[59:02] and then we just put something random
[59:05] so we do we have a list of sports here
[59:08] the list
[59:11] um
[59:12] we do a math.rent
[59:16] math that's random
[59:19] uh
[59:21] times at least I know at least I think
[59:25] at least that's length
[59:29] that's going to give me a number from
[59:31] zero
[59:32] to
[59:34] whatever 37 I think
[59:37] is that links
[59:41] at least that's at least that links
[59:45] just to be sure I'm going to do -1 I'm
[59:47] not sure I need it but
[59:49] right
[59:51] zero to another
[59:54] and then so I will have a random sport
[59:57] and then I need to do dots
[60:00] breaking up here
[60:03] the
[60:08] dots
[60:11] ID
[60:16] wait no no I don't need to do get Sports
[60:19] I just need to do list
[60:23] I go to my list
[60:25] I take a random Sport and I give it the
[60:28] ID the correct
[60:38] I have no idea if this is gonna work
[60:39] that's right
[60:45] levels is not defined oh
[60:48] okay so maybe that actually works
[60:51] game yep
[60:54] but I imported it
[60:59] get a level by level and not read
[61:03] expertly yep
[61:07] number two
[61:09] I'm just gonna console log those two
[61:10] things
[61:18] throw me
[61:19] and eleven okay
[61:22] and then we arrive at 11 11.
[61:25] oh because there's no more level
[61:32] so get current level
[61:36] and that's a default email function here
[61:38] get current level
[61:41] hey Google
[61:43] lower
[61:56] oh maybe we just do if get current level
[62:02] equal level that length
[62:05] maybe that should work
[62:08] and still grow
[62:09] and then
[62:11] now at least we get inside the function
[62:13] that's already a point let's board list
[62:16] is not defined yet that's very true
[62:21] or the Emoji
[62:28] oh
[62:30] hey I don't need to put the idea I just
[62:32] need to put a sports okay
[62:36] nope
[62:38] um what are we getting here console.log
[62:43] oh it's a math that's random so it's
[62:46] probably not
[62:52] probably a math.round
[63:02] again
[63:03] yep it's working
[63:10] okay but something else is not working
[63:11] here
[63:14] 240
[63:28] right there's an issue here
[63:32] um
[63:35] because you're so you're you have zero
[63:37] XP so that's probably why something is
[63:40] wrong
[63:42] um
[63:43] you have zero XP what is your
[63:50] console log
[63:52] what is your current sport or
[63:55] big
[64:00] [ __ ]
[64:08] all right that's what I put somewhere
[64:10] here
[64:12] but for some reason it doesn't find
[64:15] doesn't tell me
[64:21] uh where are you
[64:23] in the class name here get level by
[64:26] level
[64:28] get current level mine oh
[64:33] okay that's here it's turned level minus
[64:35] one
[64:37] why did I do minus one again
[64:39] and then it's supposed to be just
[64:42] this
[64:43] maybe this y
[64:46] I'm confused
[64:54] oh I have another issue here okay
[65:00] all right I'm gonna fix this after I
[65:02] just finished this one
[65:07] so addictive
[65:10] oh [ __ ] I missed it no we're gonna
[65:13] restart
[65:15] thing and no here
[65:18] okay you have the class name
[65:22] you are okay everything is fine okay
[65:27] you're level two
[65:29] you have 30 XP out of 40
[65:32] okay that's the issue here
[65:36] it's getting super hot in here I'm gonna
[65:39] go in my room turn on the AC
[65:48] oh
[66:05] [Music]
[66:11] oh
[66:17] it's a little bit at work yes you can
[66:20] add an expectations working my own
[66:23] decisions
[66:26] happy if it's inspiring
[66:30] the company comes to play
[66:32] okay
[66:36] however I have his gamification of your
[66:38] life
[66:40] hello
[66:41] Alexander I don't
[66:44] um I think I don't know I I think it's
[66:47] fun to launch new apps
[66:49] and um this is a separate mobile app so
[66:53] it is going to have a dedicated mobile
[66:54] apps on the stores
[66:56] and um yeah I feel like it's it's not
[66:59] really connected to habits I mean it's
[67:01] connected somehow to have his garden
[67:02] because it's using game but
[67:04] um I think it's to be if you just have a
[67:06] website it's okay to have a sub domain
[67:08] or something
[67:09] for mobile apps it's a bit tricky
[67:11] because you have all the details the
[67:13] pictures and stuff so I'd rather make it
[67:14] like a standalone app
[67:23] like
[67:31] yep Roger that
[67:33] but uh still to be to Frank um I've I've
[67:38] had habits gardening for a year and I
[67:41] spent a year without having a mobile app
[67:43] and I try to you know tell people oh you
[67:44] know you can just add the app to your
[67:45] home screen and and that would do the
[67:47] work
[67:49] um and it
[67:51] it does it still doesn't work like
[67:52] people want the app because they don't
[67:54] know how to add to their home screens
[67:56] and when you have to think for something
[67:57] that is not uh a pain it's like a habit
[68:00] tracker it's a plus stuff it's more like
[68:02] a vitamin
[68:03] and so people are not uh super committed
[68:06] into you know putting on the work to add
[68:09] the app to your home screen
[68:11] but yeah I think it's it's exciting for
[68:12] people who don't want to have the app
[68:14] it's smart
[68:16] butter
[68:19] and nope Alexander never try floater
[68:21] react native or native I just actually I
[68:23] have no idea how to make apps I just use
[68:26] capacitor
[68:30] um okay so we have our little Avatar
[68:33] here it's growing
[68:35] um
[68:37] I would like to understand why
[68:41] the value here should be zero you should
[68:44] start again when you
[68:49] oh no
[69:26] okay I have the problem everywhere so
[69:30] oh yeah okay I see what I'm doing
[69:33] I should
[69:36] go from zero and it should tell me you
[69:38] need
[69:43] to get the math are is not good here
[69:46] so
[69:48] go back to thinking
[69:50] [Music]
[69:51] um
[70:00] legs cap or
[70:26] item Center
[70:40] okay um
[70:49] my progress bar here ding dong
[70:54] a little over level what is this oh yeah
[70:55] that's the text
[70:58] [Music]
[70:58] um
[71:01] okay we're gonna do something here we're
[71:03] just gonna need some logins
[71:06] we're gonna do XP
[71:09] so I have 120 XP
[71:13] [Music]
[71:19] the next level needs 130 XP
[71:26] and the level I'm in
[71:37] okay so in total I need uh 55 XP to
[71:43] level up
[71:45] so if I do something like this uh
[71:54] I just need okay what I want as a total
[71:57] I want to see the difference
[71:59] I want to see 55.
[72:00] and same as my XP I want to see my XB
[72:04] but minus what I already got
[72:07] and levels expected I have 40 out of 55.
[72:12] which means no
[72:14] if I go on okay I have 15 out of 65.
[72:19] I think that's the solution here
[72:25] um
[72:26] my value is this
[72:29] and here is this
[72:34] and then the total value is this
[72:40] the max is this
[72:42] in here
[72:51] all right
[72:52] is it gonna work
[72:55] hey no
[72:57] uh
[73:00] 65 level five okay
[73:03] I'm supposed to have way more
[73:07] uh
[73:09] okay I did something wrong here
[73:17] my current
[73:20] oh yeah okay okay
[73:22] current XP should be minus
[73:27] exp that I required
[73:29] okay
[73:30] so I have 45 XP and I need 65.
[73:34] I grow up
[73:36] all right
[73:38] all right 70 then I have 20 out of 110.
[73:44] what if I just keep the
[73:52] okay
[73:54] you have 20 XP you have 50 of 80 okay
[73:58] you have zero
[74:00] 30 60
[74:03] 90 and 20 so 50.
[74:07] okay looks like it's working
[74:13] okay that makes all right that's cute
[74:29] okay
[74:30] um maybe select known
[74:38] all right I think this is working we
[74:40] have a demo
[74:44] um and I need to change that also in the
[74:46] app because in the app it's not working
[74:47] currently so
[74:50] um
[74:52] in the progress bar
[74:55] here I need
[74:57] this is my XP
[75:00] so I need to
[75:04] the current level
[75:06] next level do we have access to the
[75:08] current level here
[75:10] we have access to the current level this
[75:12] is my XP and I need to do XP minus level
[75:15] Dot
[75:17] level expert required
[75:23] uh nope I'm just gonna do
[75:42] I don't think I have a
[75:45] nope I don't have access to these
[75:47] accounts
[75:48] all right I need to authorize
[75:58] and I tried to add that home screen yeah
[76:00] yeah I think developers don't mind but
[76:03] as soon as they put someone who is not
[76:05] developing it's uh it's hard to get
[76:07] someone to do that
[76:10] I remember true
[76:27] so my expect level dot XP required
[76:32] and
[76:34] same
[76:37] here the maximum
[76:42] is the next level minus the current
[76:45] level I just basically removed current
[76:47] level everywhere okay
[76:49] and then
[76:51] on my XP here I do
[76:54] minus
[76:57] n minus this thing
[77:00] makes more sense
[77:02] and same here
[77:12] and basically I just needed to remove
[77:13] this everywhere okay
[77:16] completed
[77:22] okay
[77:24] all right I think that's working
[77:27] uh we're going back to the laying page
[77:31] I have my avatar that I can grow
[77:34] um I'm probably going to put this in the
[77:36] card
[77:38] please uh I'm probably gonna do
[77:41] something like our ground base huh
[77:43] putting
[77:45] or
[77:46] a rounded
[77:49] rounded 3XL
[77:55] oh yeah we need the SVG from that
[78:00] let's do the one nope
[78:03] link user pictures you know
[78:08] where are you SVG
[78:13] render sport yeah there we go is it
[78:17] it's not this one
[78:19] on this one it is
[78:26] this one SVG
[78:29] by the King menu
[78:34] the current level energy
[78:39] except for
[78:40] what am I doing here
[78:42] oh yeah okay
[78:49] that's in accents
[78:52] enter
[78:54] go to block
[78:57] uh okay so we have this this
[79:03] um
[79:06] space y four
[79:17] okay so if you restart again
[79:19] the demo is here
[79:22] no you're not supposed to start with
[79:24] this you're supposed to Target at zero
[79:26] XP bro
[79:27] oh maybe we're gonna start with
[79:30] 2xb no that is zero
[79:36] okay
[79:39] all right I think we have it guys
[79:42] that looks like this bigger size uh
[79:48] on mobile
[79:53] okay book Shadow
[79:56] oh yeah quarter radius RGB
[80:02] I mean I can add Shadows simply with
[80:04] Tailwind um
[80:07] um I show you what I can do it's just
[80:12] you're the you're the designer here so
[80:13] you let me know what you think
[80:16] I think
[80:17] because I'm using or I can use Shadow LG
[80:20] something like a bit softer I could use
[80:22] I could do something like this
[80:25] but it's just that uh
[80:27] I have a feeling that either I use
[80:30] Shadows everywhere or I just don't use
[80:32] Shadows at all
[80:33] and I kind of have a feeling that
[80:35] because we have the color the white
[80:37] color
[80:38] of the card
[80:39] that the shadow is not needed
[80:42] I just did it here
[80:44] because it's an app so somehow I wanted
[80:46] to you know tell people like uh it looks
[80:48] like an app icon but I'm feeling that we
[80:51] should not use Shadows at all everywhere
[80:52] that's the feeling
[80:54] for my poor coding perspective
[80:58] you can
[81:00] good man good good good
[81:03] are you based is it Sunday night for you
[81:05] or late nights or just a Monday morning
[81:08] from Asia
[81:15] Wuhan fried bats
[81:19] I think you have you have the coolest
[81:22] name
[81:23] ever bro
[81:25] Canada nice
[81:31] okay bro yeah I was thinking yeah
[81:34] this could be it's tempting to redesign
[81:37] everything and add Shadows everywhere
[81:39] yeah and it's actually I think
[81:40] that's what I was doing in habits Garden
[81:42] for a while
[81:44] and I was doing it the wrong way so I
[81:46] added Shadows somewhere and not at other
[81:48] places and I was like what's wrong with
[81:50] my design and then I remove all the
[81:51] shadows I'm like oh okay and I feel like
[81:53] it's either you have it everywhere or
[81:55] you don't have it otherwise just
[81:57] sometimes this is a yeah
[82:00] so here like I have some drop Shadows
[82:03] here but I don't have them here and it
[82:05] feels a bit disconnected but anyway
[82:08] all right moving on we have the card
[82:10] here
[82:14] you can grow your avatar you have some
[82:17] confettis Maybe
[82:19] I can throw more confidence now maybe 50
[82:22] so crazy
[82:43] through me
[83:02] maybe level
[83:13] oops
[83:22] maybe to make things a bit clearer
[83:26] nothing is happening
[83:29] and he made
[83:42] yep no okay that's not working
[83:44] all right it's pretty not perfect but
[83:45] working
[83:52] UAP yeah man about my I had the previous
[83:55] one 2018 and it drove me crazy I was
[83:58] like it's just so slow and so hot
[84:01] especially hearing buddy it's like even
[84:02] a hotter I work with it on my legs and
[84:04] like my legs were burning
[84:06] but no it's so good I can stream
[84:08] um I can do figma
[84:10] I can have my little simulator running
[84:13] for iOS and uh and just working it's
[84:16] also nice
[84:18] it's the uh the latest one the one I
[84:21] think 2022 or something the M2
[84:24] voted in Singapore
[84:26] a few weeks ago and five to life changer
[84:30] which since you have a third name for
[84:32] basketball to Liberal instead of Jordan
[84:36] yeah can if you're maybe I've updated
[84:39] the app you can actually uh
[84:41] I think now it it doesn't force you to
[84:44] have this thing you can choose
[84:49] oh yeah okay yeah I feel you bro I know
[84:53] the feeling of having something that
[84:54] gets so hot as soon as you open the
[84:56] Navigator
[84:57] crazy
[84:59] uh the name yeah the name here is a bit
[85:02] crappy oh maybe I can just okay I think
[85:04] I'm gonna
[85:09] uh where is my name
[85:12] I put oh yeah I didn't put the name yeah
[85:14] it's here
[85:18] um
[85:24] name
[85:28] is it gonna work no it's not gonna work
[85:30] because I don't have the sport I just
[85:32] keep this sport ID no
[85:36] actually now I get this board so it
[85:38] should work
[85:47] yeah bro what are you doing
[85:51] score that name nice man
[85:55] uh yeah okay so we have a legit name
[86:01] level seven
[86:09] okay

[86:19] reward claim MP3 should be played all
[86:22] right you know why guys you decide the
[86:23] sound we use um
[86:25] when you level up you can have something
[86:27] uh I'm gonna send you the link
[86:30] on effect
[86:35] okay you guys find something in here
[86:37] that you think is uh a good sound when
[86:41] people level up you have a lot of packs
[86:44] a lot of stuff you can I think there's a
[86:46] search here you can search stuff like
[86:47] love it up
[86:50] um
[86:52] yeah one two lots of gamification stuff
[86:56] here uh if you find one that you like
[86:58] ready send it to me and I'm gonna add it
[87:00] when people level up
[87:03] um all right I'm going to move on to the
[87:06] next screen so we we can log in
[87:12] uh hero feed the app is here give me
[87:14] your stick to your goals to level up and
[87:16] Avatar secondary divorce but here
[87:20] uh those buttons are a little bit

[87:37] place for
[87:52] uh start here or
[88:02] phone I want to know
[88:10] foreign

[89:11] Garden that points to the Avatar and
[89:14] click on Avatar to make it grow
[89:15] something like this
[89:17] oh okay way smaller so we have less
[89:19] buttons
[89:22] okay
[89:24] yeah because actually that's true it's
[89:26] getting a bit
[89:28] getting a bit big
[89:38] [Music]

[89:44] don't want to you know to
[89:46] um but tell you to do anything but if

[114:47] I think I want to reuse what I did for
[114:49] habits Garden
[114:53] I'm not gonna bother too much with this
[114:54] because it's pretty similar in a sense
[114:56] that it's a habit
[115:01] um maybe I just reuse the problem
[115:02] components
[115:10] as a look
[115:12] uh

[115:31] store
[115:32] because now it's spending they're still
[115:34] review there it's waiting for review I
[115:36] think I don't want to mess up with this
[115:37] I'm going to let them review the first
[115:39] version and then ship it the next one
[115:41] but uh
[115:43] what I'm doing but what I'm doing now
[115:44] will be available on the web in a few
[115:46] just a few hours
[116:17] I'm just doing this real quick uh
[116:21] I kind of want to reuse that thing that
[116:24] template I feel is quite nice
[116:29] um
[116:31] there we go so we're going to rotate

[121:59] building uh
[122:03] exercising consistency is hard
[122:13] consistently is hard
[122:18] all right we have a mini landing page
[122:21] now
[122:36] all right so the next part is going to
[122:39] be about features in this app
[122:43] um
[122:46] we're gonna have three features each
[122:48] three features uh the first one
[122:54] uh
[123:01] um what the first one would be
[123:04] but I think the last one will be
[123:06] um don't miss your goal
[123:10] or your character will
[123:14] shrink
[123:16] the second one would be about the
[123:18] leaderboards
[123:23] words
[123:25] and the first one is
[123:27] of it up
[123:30] here
[123:34] level up your Fitness to level up
[123:38] your character
[123:41] yeah Avatar
[123:45] that's probably gonna be the three
[123:46] features we want to introduce
[123:49] and we're going to have another section
[123:52] that says available on all platforms
[123:57] iOS web
[124:00] Android
[124:02] and the last section probably
[124:06] of the pricing
[124:10] and the last last section
[124:13] about a CTA sign up
[124:18] and of course we are going to have a
[124:21] footer
[124:22] with links and stuff
[124:28] okay that's the landing page we need to
[124:31] fill and I need to edit that ugly button

[124:44] like
[124:51] where is it oh yeah something like this
[124:53] maybe

[150:30] stuff uh
[150:34] gamification
[150:42] uppercase
[150:44] uh let's
[150:47] semi bold
[150:50] accept X accents
[150:55] tracking wide
[150:59] are we gonna get something cute or not
[151:02] gamification make workouts fun
[151:05] okay
[151:10] here we go and moving on we're gonna do
[151:12] this dates for three features uh the
[151:16] next one will be uh social
[151:21] um how do you how do we call social
[151:25] um
[151:27] you would have
[151:32] no more shirts actually I always I am
[151:35] always shirt off I just uh
[151:37] I don't know
[151:39] I feel like
[151:40] I don't know maybe some people don't
[151:42] like hits and um that's not the purpose
[151:45] of the stream so I just go on and
[151:48] keep it off social proof boom uh social
[151:51] accountability no
[151:53] the the
[151:55] um the fact that you have leaderboards
[151:57] so people can see your
[152:00] your progress
[152:01] I think I would I think it's social
[152:05] accountability
[152:12] I don't know if you see what I mean
[152:14] um
[152:15] I say I'm I'm not English native so
[152:17] sometimes my words are not the right one
[152:20] yeah
[152:21] I think I can't say or just
[152:22] accountability
[152:24] accountability
[152:26] accountability
[152:29] I gotta have I'm gonna need the help of
[152:32] Google for that
[152:39] accountability or maybe just
[152:40] accountability
[152:55] it's about
[152:57] um
[152:58] the little board stuff
[153:00] the fact that you see other people
[153:02] you're being competing you're competing
[153:04] against them
[153:06] um you see their current score
[153:08] um it's just a quick like I did here
[153:11] it's the topic of that paragraph here
[153:14] it's about gamification here it's about
[153:16] social accountability or positive peer
[153:20] pressure
[153:21] that kind of works
[153:24] fomo
[153:31] yeah I mean it's some kind of it's some
[153:34] kind of familiar
[153:35] if it had a positive uh Vibe I would I
[153:38] would definitely put it
[153:39] Victorious
[153:44] really benchmarking
[153:49] delicious citizens
[153:52] social positive peer pressure
[153:58] there's something encouragement for sure
[154:02] maybe social accountability
[154:11] I think social accountability or just
[154:14] accountability works
[154:24] uh we can change that later later why
[154:28] um
[154:33] Chef is coming home
[154:41] special accountability
[154:52] make workouts fun
[155:07] workout maybe you work out with friends
[155:10] or yeah
[155:12] or exercise
[155:16] com compete against users
[155:21] exercise
[155:24] with users
[155:27] my little boards
[155:33] let me just climb into the boards
[155:36] pulling into boards make workouts when
[155:38] again climbing into boards
[155:40] um
[155:48] culture ranking better ask chat DPT yep
[155:52] social ranking
[155:55] yep yep social ranking works too
[155:58] maybe just social
[156:01] I think I think the word accountability
[156:03] is important in the sense that it's it
[156:06] it's a positive emotion people want to
[156:08] be accountable
[156:11] um
[156:14] I claim leaderboards uh

[165:06] social Academy the claimed leaderboards
[165:08] here we get something here we're gonna
[165:10] do some video editing stuff I guess
[165:13] because we need something that shows on
[165:16] those
[165:17] pages
[165:19] uh what could we have
[165:24] gamification make workouts fun
[165:31] I think it's time to show the app in use
[165:33] huh
[165:48] all right I think I'm gonna have to
[165:49] create a new character
[165:52] um
[165:53] is there remark clue I'm going to delete
[165:54] sorry bro all right
[165:59] uh I want to sign up with Google
[166:16] maybe you're covered so it's okay
[166:22] foreign
[166:36] Square video
[166:42] probably screen size should be this way
[166:47] as this Square
[166:51] as the size of this
[166:54] computed
[166:57] 540 by 90 okay
[167:03] I will just make it square like this
[167:21] oh it created uh
[167:28] we create one Avatar
[167:32] then we level it up
[167:37] I think that's going to be
[167:39] good enough
[167:42] good morning Mark your Legend all right
[167:43] I'm gonna do a little screen recording
[167:47] of the use Mic no actually yeah I'm done

[167:53] you had some good time
[167:56] yeah it's hard
[167:58] I'll take place tomorrow
[168:07] all right
[168:13] are we on track with I think yeah the
[168:17] pixels are aligned
[168:20] oh yeah it does it for me no it no it
[168:23] doesn't does you
[168:25] all right this is pretty much good
[168:29] video recording three two one go
[168:34] all right oh I have no idea what I'm
[168:36] gonna say in my video uh what should I
[168:39] say
[168:41] who should I pick airG maybe basketball
[168:43] and Air Jordan okay we're gonna do Air
[168:46] Jordan no someone said LeBron okay I'm
[168:48] going to call it LeBron James
[169:09] foreign
[169:10] here we go Final Cut Pro
[169:19] a new collection
[169:24] I guess a new library here
[169:27] is it
[169:30] I'm gonna call you we're gonna call you
[169:32] hero of it
[169:37] import
[169:39] ant and we are
[169:42] my download stuff
[169:46] is it the one yes the one
[169:48] here we go project new
[169:55] um
[169:56] feature create workout
[170:02] a square
[170:05] I think 700 should be okay
[170:08] good
[170:11] and then we're just gonna crop a few
[170:13] stuff real quick
[170:15] make sure the video is fast enough but I
[170:18] don't have my mouse or anything
[170:36] all right I think it's the speed how is
[170:39] the speed
[170:43] yeah it's a bit slow so
[170:50] system
[170:54] start again 10 second video
[171:07] okay I think that should be enough
[171:17] uh
[171:20] yes are you okay
[171:36] [Music]
[171:37] um
[171:38] bingo
[171:40] what's the name of it
[171:47] megabytes
[171:49] apology is okay
[171:52] oh this is okay
[171:54] and I have to host this on AWS
[171:57] and maybe we do a move
[172:00] to MP4
[172:02] or these on the next good simulator to
[172:04] have the app course sorry sitter
[172:06] we record this on the xcode similar to
[172:08] have the app cursor
[172:10] the add cursor
[172:14] you see because I'm using uh the web
[172:17] version
[172:18] but with capacitories it looks normally
[172:20] it looks exactly the same
[172:23] oh okay
[172:27] okay
[172:30] there's oh yeah you're gonna see the
[172:31] pointer yeah
[172:36] okay
[172:38] because I think I also use
[172:41] um
[172:42] something that's normally yeah you see
[172:44] this blue stuff that shows
[172:46] like or you can see it's a mouse but uh
[172:49] somehow it's cool to have like the
[172:51] little roof
[172:53] and uh
[172:55] yeah I don't I don't even honestly I
[172:56] don't even know if someone will watch
[172:57] the video I'll just move I will just uh
[173:00] I'll finish this way real quick and
[173:07] and download Move
[173:13] hurts
[173:18] um signing to the console I'm gonna need
[173:22] 2fa normally
[173:31] okay Royal um yeah okay
[173:38] you're not gonna show
[173:55] Amazon web services
[173:59] yep
[174:01] and it is
[174:21] and we're gonna have to create a new
[174:24] bucket
[174:26] create a folder that we're gonna call
[174:28] hero bit
[174:33] and here
[174:41] we're going to upload that
[174:44] oh maybe I need to download the video
[174:45] first
[174:49] oh man it's so nice it goes from two
[174:52] megabytes to 657.
[174:54] so I'm not going to burn my AWS credits
[175:00] uh we're gonna say feature one okay
[175:09] oh
[175:12] uh in the meantime I'm going to need the
[175:14] code
[175:16] maybe this thing
[175:19] video yeah
[175:22] the config as well
[175:28] uh check
[175:36] Hero Kids
[175:45] for the first video in here will be
[175:53] I'm not gonna do a poster
[175:56] we're gonna round this to LG aspect
[175:59] square with full SM with 94 LG with 32.
[176:05] one
[176:11] right let's see how that goes
[176:14] hey hey it's working
[176:25] oh maybe it's confusing
[176:27] maybe it's confusing because it's people
[176:29] don't know it's a video
[176:32] so it doesn't because of the background
[176:34] is the same so maybe I need to add some
[176:36] kind of borders
[176:39] a ring or
[176:41] Shadow Maybe
[176:45] no
[176:47] um
[176:50] or otherwise I just make the whole
[176:51] section with a white background
[176:56] EG base 100.
[177:02] is it working oh okay
[177:04] uh because I have the padding there
[177:16] it's
[177:25] um
[177:30] actually that would make sense
[177:32] if I do instead if I remove this
[177:37] and
[177:39] and this
[177:44] and then let each elements take care of
[177:46] the width
[177:48] what that looks like
[178:06] each section
[178:09] is the master
[178:25] this is gonna work
[178:27] uh no you didn't get it
[178:29] did you yeah you did it
[178:33] but that still works
[178:36] [Music]
[178:39] and this one here would have
[178:47] no margins for now
[178:56] foreign
[179:00] s
[179:07] I'm gonna wrap this
[179:10] inside of another div
[179:13] which then is going to be less
[179:27] all right that's a bit better I mean it
[179:30] looks ugly still but I need
[179:32] to finish
[179:33] and space y
[179:40] EP
[179:42] and something like
[179:44] m y 12 oops
[179:51] um
[179:54] opening X
[179:56] I think by 12.
[180:01] but I need to finish this later but I
[180:05] think it could be something here
[180:06] at least we see it's a video
[180:09] and also it means
[180:12] this thing here
[180:14] would be a just a div
[180:17] last name this
[180:22] should be a flex
[180:25] all MD legs row
[180:31] in this
[180:34] last name
[180:37] base word okay
[180:39] uh
[180:44] get four
[180:48] and ND Gap 12.
[180:55] video is way too big
[181:00] but if we resize
[181:02] we get the video at the right place so
[181:04] that's good
[181:07] and maybe the video will then be
[181:12] um
[181:13] smlg MD
[181:18] my computer is slow for the first time
[181:20] ever
[181:21] are you okay bro
[181:26] all right yeah it's a bit better 20 20
[181:28] 24 yeah
[181:46] yeah okay not bad
[181:50] maybe just
[181:51] yeah we just don't need this one
[181:57] my computer is being slowest uh
[182:01] I haven't had this oh maybe it's because
[182:02] of Final Cut Pro no
[182:07] close figma
[182:11] feels like I'm back to my old computer
[182:14] and the video maybe we need to make it a
[182:17] bit more shiny we're gonna make it a
[182:19] border two or something
[182:24] okay
[182:40] make workouts fun
[182:47] okay video number two never miss your
[182:49] goal
[182:51] um
[182:55] oh are we gonna show that
[183:13] it doesn't have to be a video
[183:26] when I'm using the gray Square as a mess
[183:28] for your video
[183:31] let me know what I mean
[183:33] the gray is Queer as a mask for your
[183:36] video
[183:38] I don't think I thought
[183:49] if you like the screen if you want
[184:33] his life
[184:34] the Creator just below the video is
[184:37] around its Square
[184:42] oh
[184:48] I'm gonna remove these bro it's it's
[184:50] just I put it as a placeholder so when I
[184:53] was building I know a bit where elements
[184:55] would be but I'm gonna replace that
[184:57] square here by either another video or
[185:01] a picture or something
[185:06] and um in the radius I think
[185:10] oh what are we I think we're gonna I'm
[185:12] just gonna use the same I use we're
[185:13] using the app
[185:15] uh
[185:19] okay yeah we're using oh I don't really
[185:22] remember that okay
[185:23] we're using
[185:25] whatever Index app
[185:28] rounded to excel nope
[185:31] we're using a three Excel export Avatar
[185:38] yeah I think it's a 3XL okay okay
[185:42] okay I'm gonna use rounded 3XL pretty
[185:46] much everywhere
[185:49] um
[185:51] starting by the video
[185:53] okay rounded maybe the border is not
[185:56] needed now
[185:59] and just above these things
[186:03] is it around it
[186:11] okay for the logo I think I need to use
[186:14] maybe 2XL I think 3XL will be too much
[186:17] yeah it's way too much
[186:20] it's too small
[186:22] maybe we can use 2XL that's fine
[186:27] gee
[186:30] hey that's for this that makes sense too
[186:38] what is that thing what am I using here
[186:42] it's a card oh yeah because it's an old
[186:44] design yeah
[186:46] um probably I don't think it's rounded
[186:48] 3XL
[186:51] it is
[186:54] oh no it's the wrong one
[186:56] I think it's in the card here
[187:01] card
[187:09] I think anyway I should not be using
[187:11] this should not have a card I should
[187:13] just go back to whatever I was doing
[187:15] before
[187:18] only 3XL
[187:21] uh
[187:23] was I using their pudding
[187:28] it's a putting four in here it's a
[187:30] padding for two
[187:32] oh probably the card buddy
[187:37] okay
[187:47] okay
[187:52] so I'm using the same padding everywhere
[187:54] and also the rounded Edge
[187:58] rounded three XL whatever you are
[188:02] okay
[188:04] I'm gonna replace all those cards card
[188:07] body likes
[188:09] and here we are going to remove that and
[188:12] do
[188:13] it in 24.
[188:18] in uh what size this
[188:21] xlg
[188:24] 88.
[188:45] your best
[188:48] nocturnal
[188:54] 16 16.
[188:57] is that enough I think it's enough
[189:00] I think it's good
[189:02] car car card and the last one card card
[189:06] compact
[189:09] four and here just Flex
[189:15] all right that does it
[190:04] think of the Eraser okay never mind then
[190:10] right
[190:14] oh [ __ ] it looks [ __ ] though
[190:18] of course
[190:20] um
[190:23] maybe that card
[190:25] forget my new habits putting
[190:29] maybe what it's MD it should be headings
[190:31] okay
[190:36] Twitter
[190:46] I think eight Let's Go Crazy
[190:50] all right if I think eight works
[190:53] for
[190:56] adding eight
[190:57] ah my computer is slow it's so strange
[191:02] please MacBook don't leave me you're so
[191:04] hot
[191:14] okay what is actually going on in that
[191:15] computer
[191:16] why are you so hot
[191:19] foreign
[191:27] [Music]
[191:36] OBS Studio
[191:39] are you okay obs
[191:41] I just I'll just try a little thing real
[191:44] quick face
[191:47] hello
[191:53] and if I do this
[192:05] I don't know um the ram 25 I don't
[192:09] remember check it out
[192:12] 32.
[192:15] would be enough for what I'm doing
[192:19] we're going to give it a little bit more
[192:21] time to process
[192:23] what's going on because I've never had
[192:24] any issues before and I was doing the
[192:27] same thing
[192:29] let's see
[192:31] um
[192:32] oh it's laggy damn it
[192:34] no fun
[192:40] [Music]
[192:44] opening four in here maybe empty I think
[192:47] eight I'm doing too much into details
[192:52] but I think yeah we need this padding
[192:54] okay
[192:55] four cents
[192:57] and so here
[193:00] I'm going to be adding a top
[193:04] of
[193:07] minus 12.
[193:13] minus 14.
[193:16] bro
[193:26] all right that's enough
[193:29] to grow bingo
[193:31] this is working uh
[193:34] invocation make workouts fun use your
[193:38] workout avatars okay
[193:44] yep
[193:46] oh good point
[193:48] I mean it is here maybe I just quit it
[193:52] uh it's
[193:56] I'll relaunch it again let's see
[193:59] anyways my mic is telling me that this
[194:01] Visual Studio that is consuming a lot of
[194:03] energy
[194:05] uh
[194:09] who knows maybe I'll just gonna console
[194:11] [Music]
[194:11] um
[194:13] add stuff and then I'm probably going to
[194:16] close the dev server
[194:19] and close them all
[194:25] yeah quit
[194:27] I quit
[194:31] doodle Purge
[194:33] what
[194:35] I thought you were a designer who know
[194:37] how to code that now you're a designer
[194:39] you know how to code and you're a system
[194:40] engineer
[194:42] what's going on
[194:46] right now actually I think cleaning uh I
[194:48] think maybe xcode was having some issues
[194:51] because now it's way faster
[194:54] I'll keep the that thing in mind I
[194:57] didn't know you could Purge around this
[194:59] way
[195:01] and
[195:03] I don't have it anymore
[195:06] okay you reopen all the versions perfect
[195:10] so

[204:27] is those
[204:28] those like belly lizard that looks like
[204:31] mini crocodiles
[204:32] they ate my chicken last year I had two
[204:35] chickens in my garden and I came back
[204:36] one day and they were destroyed it
[204:38] they're like this one is about this size
[204:41] maybe this size with the tail
[204:44] and he just he's climbing on the wall
[204:50] it has been quite active during the the
[204:52] streams
[204:54] normally if you're gonna see anything
[204:55] it's really
[204:58] he's actually looking at us right now
[205:03] it's very hard to see I think you need
[205:04] to have good quality because it's uh it
[205:06] is between the windows stuff
[205:11] if you can see
[205:16] there it is let me know if you can see
[205:19] it on this on the
[205:21] the chat I want to know if the quality
[205:22] is good for you
[205:27] yay
[205:32] I think lizard
[205:35] I'm sorry
[205:37] um all right
[205:45] import
[205:49] image from
[205:59] the future
[206:02] what do they call it I call it feature
[206:05] one bro
[206:06] what are you doing your name
[206:27] I'm gonna replace this by the image
[206:31] and no priority
[206:34] um
[206:36] you
[206:37] work out
[206:40] three
[206:42] workout avatars
[206:47] Church image
[206:49] and we're going to reuse the same size
[206:51] of the video
[206:54] aspect square around the 3XL
[207:11] I have a white background so it doesn't
[207:13] make sense
[207:16] uh
[207:19] never miss your goal
[207:23] all right anyway it's okay
[207:27] yeah it's gonna be all right
[207:43] throw your legging again
[207:48] what is going on
[207:53] yeah it's pretty hot
[208:16] [Music]
[208:54] this is another 24.
[209:00] oh yeah
[209:03] but anyway there isn't only one so that
[209:06] this doesn't make sense
[209:08] here 24.
[209:15] never miss your goal oh no
[209:24] maybe you can do this
[209:59] in the leaderboard
[210:01] editor board we are going to take um
[210:08] oh maybe menu you've done some stuff
[210:10] that could reuse
[210:12] here
[210:16] yep I think I'm gonna reuse that
[210:19] that is perfect
[210:26] I love lemon
[210:28] saving me
[210:38] um and here again
[210:46] League level one
[210:50] level three
[211:02] recently
[211:10] just nothing you were gonna make
[211:14] this
[211:17] something like
[211:20] maybe 350 by 350.
[211:32] all right it doesn't make sense to keep
[211:33] a square image in that sense
[211:52] frame feature three
[212:07] okay and here we go
[212:28] wait I need to import that
[212:40] hello vs code why are you slow

[213:42] I don't know if I should have made that
[213:44] background that color
[213:47] it should just keep it the right way
[213:50] and do something like border
[213:57] yeah I think I'm gonna stay with this
[214:00] a bit simpler
[214:06] okay

[233:45] other
[233:52] yep
[233:53] it's using stripe if you want to try and
[233:55] so it's using stripe on the web
[233:58] and it's using the native stuff on the
[234:01] mobile apps
[234:03] and you can try actually if you want you
[234:06] can create an account and try to create

[234:17] hey manui it's
[234:19] um do you think so I have those two
[234:22] plans here
[234:23] I'm trying to make this one shine a
[234:25] little bit more
[234:27] oh maybe just by making the button
[234:29] normal and not outlined
[234:35] I was thinking I could add some whatever
[234:40] I could add some border like they do on
[234:42] childwind but it's just a bit weird
[234:43] because I don't have much Waters in this
[234:45] uh in order to order accents
[234:59] I do this
[235:01] look
[235:12] okay put it in here
[235:15] I need to rework on that
[235:18] wait actually let me finish that you see
[235:22] Flex row
[235:24] justify Center
[235:32] item Center

[235:46] bases

[235:58] and I'm going to give them Max width of
[236:01] 4 XL Maybe
[236:04] right that's better
[236:12] um and maybe the text here could be
[236:14] Center
[236:17] MD
[236:24] Center
[236:30] right
[236:34] this cover premium well I think that's

[245:46] let's take your loss level up level up
[245:49] to work and climb the little boards okay
[245:54] have to grow
[246:12] huge
[246:32] um yep capacitor allows you to do that I
[246:36] think you need a plug-in or something
[246:39] I haven't tried myself but uh
[246:42] and if you have any questions on the
[246:44] about capacitor the guy the capacitor
[246:47] King
[246:48] no joke okay this guy turned my app into
[246:50] a
[246:52] a native app in like two weeks if my
[246:55] tutor allows me but no I just send you
[246:58] his uh
[247:00] oh yeah this guy
[247:05] there is this guy is a really really
[247:09] like he tweets about capacitor and he
[247:11] shares the the pros of it
[247:14] and I think he has made a plugin that
[247:16] lets you ship live update on capacitor
[247:34] for your work yeah

[414:24] um
[414:25] read up okay
[414:28] so we left here uh go for today we have
[414:30] to finish the landing page and we have
[414:32] to fix that error that is a bit uh
[414:34] annoying on Android
[414:38] yo Leonard
[414:41] um
[414:42] yeah if I have time I would love to
[414:45] implement this
[414:46] I don't think it's going to be possible
[414:48] but um
[414:50] anyway
[414:52] maybe all right I'm gonna put it that
[414:54] way
[414:55] um
[414:57] I think we're good with that so we're
[414:58] good with the good with that goes with
[414:59] that
[415:02] hey man I was doing some maths at what
[415:03] time do you wake up
[415:05] at what time do I wake up uh I think
[415:07] around 6am
[415:09] I don't have an alarm I think yeah 6am
[415:12] something like that
[415:14] and I go to bed at around 10.
[415:19] oh you're a hero okay let's finish the
[415:22] landing page you are a hero
[415:28] oh it was
[415:35] or Excel
[415:38] okay
[415:42] that works I'm gonna do some credit guys
[415:45] um if you haven't already send me your
[415:49] um Twitter
[415:50] handle I'm gonna credit everyone on the
[415:53] stream who's been tuning in for a little
[415:54] while because I think it's a
[415:57] very fun app that we've built together
[416:01] I'm honestly not sure I would have ever
[416:02] been able to do that on myself
[416:04] well at least he would have never looked
[416:06] that good
[416:08] um
[416:09] at least I posted on the live stream on
[416:11] YouTube massive things to
[416:15] [Music]
[416:17] all right we're gonna have to create the
[416:19] designer who's the king
[416:22] design
[416:26] Martin
[416:35] deck
[416:46] or she could do that I'm assuming it
[416:48] let's see me at 4am it'll give it 11 A.M
[416:51] anyway if that works for you bro I mean
[416:53] 4 am 11 am what was it seven hours
[416:55] you're getting enough sleep you can just
[416:58] be a late night person and I think it's
[417:01] fine
[417:02] here in Bali it's hard to sleep until at
[417:04] 11 because um it gets at 6 a.m the sun
[417:07] rise up and then it gets really hot
[417:09] it it's uh it's kind of common to wake
[417:12] up early
[417:15] you can also move the body and that's
[417:16] another option
[417:19] over a given level
[417:23] also when the Emoji is over a given
[417:25] level it gives an undefined and not an
[417:26] object evaluating g dot image o
[417:29] oh [ __ ] bro you found it back um are you
[417:32] talking about this little test here
[417:34] or something in the app if you're
[417:37] talking about something in the app how
[417:38] come you've been able to level up that
[417:40] fast
[417:42] you want a bug or something
[417:58] other test okay
[417:59] let's see it together then um so over a
[418:03] given oh maybe because you're trying the
[418:05] previous version
[418:08] oh I think you're training this one and
[418:10] I made a mistake
[418:14] uh well we're gonna see it together
[418:16] no actually I think you have the latest
[418:18] version
[418:20] over a given the ball gives an undefined
[418:26] [ __ ] I don't see any error on my site
[418:47] all right so here you said that
[418:49] over a given level I'm not an object
[418:53] I don't know
[418:57] all right I don't know if
[419:05] I am stuck
[419:06] [Music]
[419:08] around till we potentially get some more
[419:11] ink on this I'm gonna finish the page

[430:32] very fun we need to find a maybe a new
[430:34] hashtag for this so that was the
[430:36] building public hashtag here maybe it's

[431:11] wait the real Emoji has this on it
[431:16] oh yeah
[431:19] what I'm learning something to do did
[431:22] you guys know that the popcorn Emoji the
[431:23] french fries images have a happy Emoji
[431:27] inside of it
[431:29] thank you
[431:30] I don't understand why
[431:34] what is that for learning stuff
[431:37] okay
[431:38] um
[431:45] yeah yeah I know what you're doing oh
[431:48] wait I'm trying to understand your code
[431:49] I want to I want to see what's the logic
[431:52] behind do you have a reality overflow
[431:53] hidden grounded
[431:58] he made known transform the blur oh wow
[432:03] Smart Bro super smart
[432:24] um and that is absolutely dope okay all
[432:28] right
[432:29] well the goal was to build the up in
[432:31] seven days but
[432:33] sometimes there are little things like
[432:35] these are the two nice not to add
[432:39] we're going to have to add this thing in
[432:42] here so I'm going to commit
[432:44] this stuff
[432:47] and move on with the demo maybe we will
[432:49] start first with the app because I think
[432:52] this look the best in the creation page
[432:54] in this page
[432:56] here yeah here would be just perfect
[432:59] so sign up page
[433:01] and the dot Emoji is here this is the
[433:04] Emoji right
[433:06] okay
[433:08] uh so what you're doing is you have a
[433:12] div with two stuff inside
[433:22] um
[433:23] we need the keys
[433:26] I do LG maybe we don't need the shadow
[433:28] for this Beijing cover yep uh rounded XL
[433:32] overflow Eden and the width
[433:36] um I think I'm Gonna Leave the width oh
[433:39] maybe I need a fixed width
[433:41] let's see
[433:45] um the right Emoji the one hit this
[433:49] and this
[433:52] uh
[433:53] we put it for excel
[433:57] maybe just Excel blur or maybe we're
[433:59] going to keep this one like this
[434:02] uh okay cursor pointer
[434:07] we need this as well
[434:09] duration
[434:12] of the transform away we'll see after
[434:14] this
[434:15] let's give it a try on click we want to
[434:17] click keep that function
[434:20] and we are going to delete that
[434:24] right it seems to be working it is it is
[434:29] completely working
[434:32] I'll need to adjust a few things
[434:34] maybe reduce a blur or something
[434:41] oh yeah if I release ah this is dope
[434:47] a legend
[434:49] you're an absolute Legend
[434:52] um can we remove the skill
[434:55] oh maybe we shouldn't remove the scale
[434:57] because it's the blur stuff
[434:59] all right we are now going to remove the
[435:01] scale and we're going to also put the
[435:03] 4XL for the text
[435:05] here
[435:06] [Music]
[435:07] um
[435:08] we don't need that normally okay we need
[435:12] somehow
[435:13] Focus there oops oh they're absolutely
[435:15] positioned okay so maybe we'll reduce to
[435:17] 16. oh
[435:26] exchange Maybe 18.
[435:29] no it doesn't exist okay
[435:32] um we're gonna have to create 18 or
[435:34] notes is it too big or not too big
[435:37] how was it in the current app
[435:52] it's dope man I think yeah just a little
[435:54] bit bigger
[435:56] um
[436:04] 4.5 I think should be enough
[436:10] yeah it looks good man hot it's dope
[436:17] all right we need to keep those function
[436:20] the stuff we've had before we need to
[436:23] show a border somewhere
[436:28] foreign here
[436:52] it's so nice
[436:58] um see what we have here Z index 50 that
[437:02] is 50.
[437:08] I think they should be 40 you know yep
[437:13] you know
[437:16] transform translate up that index
[437:21] left okay this seems to be
[437:23] perfect
[437:24] maybe just for fun we're gonna do LG
[437:27] I think LG is a little bit too much we
[437:32] can do it Excel yeah just just
[437:35] lovely
[437:36] absolutely lovely
[437:40] all right I think we're gonna move on
[437:42] with that
[437:43] does it work yep he works
[437:46] here we go
[437:49] brand new app
[437:53] are these are English separation I'm
[437:55] using on Twitter soon hope you'll get
[437:56] too much yep it's Dopeman
[438:00] I'm curious what's actually happening if
[438:03] I remove the Emoji others have learned
[438:06] look like
[438:08] okay
[438:09] okay sweet

[442:07] to have the background here but still I
[442:10] mean those two pages that with the

[452:21] and we can just put it for Excel
[452:24] everywhere
[452:29] available everywhere all right our
[452:33] lovely

[453:55] and Google next to it and then
[453:56] underneath

[454:01] or
[454:03] I delete
[454:05] the one you're not on the right device
[454:08] so if it's
[454:15] weird
[454:21] what does the app look like on a mobile

[508:31] let's see what I do in habits card and
[508:35] it's
[508:36] use sound
[509:00] it's an mp4 MP3
[509:04] and an ncme use
[509:09] sound I think it's called
[509:12] the correct
[509:14] uh in the index we're gonna use
[509:17] this
[509:20] and here we're gonna import
[509:22] place on completion
[509:25] uh and I think the name is
[509:34] re uh completion
[509:37] so OGG that we're going to put in here
[509:42] multiplication
[509:44] dot Ogg
[509:47] volume we're gonna put it one for now
[509:52] and then when we level up
[509:57] we're gonna say this
[510:07] right I think that's too much
[510:10] [Music]
[510:13] yeah it needs to be a like
[510:17] uh
[510:21] game Arts
[510:29] sound effects
[510:32] up
[510:34] maybe power
[510:36] in
[510:40] sound effect search
[510:44] [Music]
[510:46] maybe this stuff
[510:48] one two three
[510:53] [Music]
[510:59] cannot send links in here you can DM me
[511:03] on Twitter if you want
[511:04] foreign
[511:10] [Music]
[511:11] actually sounds like Mario
[511:16] let's try it
[511:17] [Music]
[511:29] [Music]
[511:32] not bad maybe a bit too much okay
[511:35] [Music]
[511:37] yes
[511:38] all right you know what first thing I'm
[511:39] gonna do is
[511:41] [Music]
[511:43] I want you
[511:45] in the video
[511:50] so just make sure I don't miss them
[511:54] where should I lost you
[512:00] all right you're there
[512:06] can you not make this sound anymore
[512:08] thank you
[512:13] I think it's a good one the thing is
[512:15] um the reason why they want to have a
[512:17] really really short one
[512:19] is because here you go from levels one
[512:22] to level two whenever you click and then
[512:24] again you go level three and then again
[512:26] you go level four that's a lot of like a
[512:28] a lot of progress in a very short time
[512:32] and here what's going to happen because
[512:34] the user will click once twice or three
[512:36] times and you're gonna be like and the
[512:39] sun will not stop so I'm looking for
[512:40] something very short like
[512:44] it's maybe one of those
[512:48] but thank you thank you bro I really
[512:50] appreciate you sending this on
[512:52] maybe mushroom like in Mario
[512:55] okay
[512:57] hey we're making the whole pot I don't
[513:00] have you in the list as well we're
[513:01] making the
[513:03] that's just so fun we're making this
[513:05] together
[513:11] yo
[513:13] maybe even we can have departments at
[513:15] the end like a poll and see it where the
[513:17] sound Department
[513:20] [Music]
[513:21] hey hey let's see complete task maybe
[513:24] the first one
[513:31] yeah I like it it's pretty short thanks
[513:33] man I'll go with this one
[513:37] uh completion I can remove this
[513:42] oh maybe you know I can keep it for
[513:44] later
[513:46] here
[513:50] we are completion MP3
[513:54] let's try can you guys hear the sound
[513:56] from my computer if I click
[514:00] [Music]
[514:06] I just put it to the wrong place
[514:11] you're not supposed to play the song bro
[514:22] oh
[514:24] beef
[514:26] company
[514:29] oh yeah it's supposed to be yeah okay
[514:31] I'm supposed to play it but I'm supposed
[514:32] to play it with the company
[514:35] so now I don't play it and then you
[514:39] and here
[514:42] Bingo okay
[514:44] also I'm gonna reduce this to 20 because
[514:46] I think it's too much
[514:48] oh dingo
[514:51] oh maybe just a
[514:54] interesting too
[515:03] [Music]
[515:08] okay
[515:10] that makes a little bit more sense and
[515:11] we are also going to do the same thing
[515:15] in the Index app where you have your
[515:21] own avatars
[515:24] there it is
[515:27] playing some competition I'm probably
[515:30] gonna play the OGG one because this time
[515:33] user can only complete once
[515:36] which means
[515:38] they're not going to be like uh
[515:40] Orchestra stuff
[515:43] so level up
[515:46] um add record company
[515:48] [Music]
[515:50] oh or maybe I just played the sound
[515:54] whenever you complete okay yeah maybe
[515:56] I'll just play the sound that you since
[515:59] maybe it's even simpler wait
[516:03] how do people know they have level up
[516:06] uh all right but I have to create an
[516:08] avatar and see
[516:13] oh by the way there's a good news

[518:23] have so they check this and they didn't
[518:25] see the privacy policy
[518:28] and probably what we have to do is on
[518:32] the sign up page Maybe
[518:34] we'll need to add this stuff
[518:47] page footer
[518:55] an assignment page we are going to add
[518:59] these
[519:01] future
[519:05] neutral the Maps iOS Android we're not

[530:40] yeah because I think I'll I will only
[530:44] use the footer components uh I never
[530:47] know where
[530:49] you know how the app will change in
[530:50] things so I try to not make reasonable
[530:52] components until I know this is going to
[530:54] be the final version if that makes sense
[531:03] I think we're good with that
[531:08] let's check the stores let's say if we
[531:09] have any answer from Apple or Google
[531:12] because we submitted the app on Saturday
[531:14] I think
[531:17] yeah Saturday
[531:19] so inshallah we get uh
[531:22] we get a feedback maybe Google because
[531:24] they're usually faster
[531:27] internal testing
[531:31] it is still in review okay
[531:35] okay an apple is uh
[531:40] yep that's not the right one
[531:42] it is still in review alright both apps
[531:45] are still in review it's gonna be tricky
[531:47] to be up and running tomorrow
[531:50] uh anyway we don't have control over the
[531:53] stores
[531:56] let's check the phone version of this
[531:58] landing page

[536:26] and normally
[536:29] likes rep
[536:31] ah yeah it could have been I just
[536:32] because the picture is a bit vertical I
[536:34] just wanted to keep it like a list
[536:37] not Super 60 but uh
[536:39] I think that works now
[536:41] thank you banaya
[536:44] I save things too
[536:47] and send me your Twitter bro
[536:51] anyone who has been contributed on this
[536:53] app will need to be created somewhere

[537:00] oh yeah
[537:13] yeah okay okay
[537:16] let's

[537:57] [Music]
[538:23] here we go
[538:26] there you know yep
[538:33] um
[538:36] right I think we're good with the app
[538:38] for now
[538:43] all right so I'm having a few issues on
[538:45] that thing maybe I'll need an iPhone
[538:50] you can just I can do it on my phone for
[538:52] now
[538:54] all right anything I think the URL is
[538:56] thank you buddy I appreciate it it's uh
[539:00] actually if you are curious about design
[539:02] this guy is the one who made the design
[539:04] for that app
[539:07] check out his work
[539:08] super cool
[539:12] uh okay
[539:20] all right so we have these errors to
[539:23] think we have to check the payments
[539:26] working well and then you got an Android
[539:29] and tomorrow we'll need to make
[539:31] everything that we need for product ends
[539:35] so that can be done in one day and today
[539:38] we can finish the day with this error
[539:41] eventually I think notifications
[539:47] all right let's connect Android Studio
[539:49] to my phone I'm going also to build the
[539:52] app
[539:54] and mobile
[539:58] the best duplicate already registered
[540:00] okay
[540:03] um pair using Wi-Fi
[540:26] okay maybe I can surf
[540:31] ah it's windy
[540:41] let's build
[541:01] better okay grow or create your support
[541:05] Avatar
[541:13] okay that's the issue I have
[541:22] maybe I can show you my screen so you
[541:25] guys can see what I'm struggling with
[541:27] and the last bug needed to be fixed
[541:31] so
[541:32] um
[541:34] your feet maybe you're just gonna remove
[541:35] all that
[541:38] maybe I can
[541:39] I'll never be able to find
[541:45] closed alt tabs
[541:48] and I am supposed to find
[541:52] why are there so many webview okay
[541:58] okay so that is The View on my phone
[542:02] for the app so I built the app on my
[542:05] phone so it's it's here
[542:09] um
[542:12] I'm just curious I'm gonna go back so on
[542:15] the sign out page in here
[542:17] I have a little issue where
[542:21] if I close it it's fine
[542:23] but if I start to type something it's
[542:25] going to push the view up as you can see
[542:27] here
[542:28] because of the keyboard basically or
[542:30] underneath the keyboard
[542:33] and then
[542:34] if I close the keyboard and I create my
[542:37] avatar
[542:42] it is
[542:43] fine or it's not fine
[542:46] yep no because so here the what happened
[542:50] is that
[542:51] I'm not supposed to see that I'm
[542:53] supposed to see the view has been pushed
[542:55] up and it doesn't go down
[542:59] and that's tricky
[543:06] um let's see maybe
[543:08] if it's also buggy on iOS
[543:14] could be interesting to see that
[543:19] and I think
[543:26] oh the ranges are now working here
[543:29] Orange
[543:32] y o with
[543:36] uh create
[543:39] sign up
[543:43] page
[543:45] the Emoji stuff is
[543:49] here
[543:52] overflow hidden
[543:55] right what's going on if it's supposed
[543:57] to be hidden why are you here
[544:03] because the container has overflow y O2
[544:09] um
[544:11] I think it's somewhere I'm I I think I'm
[544:15] fix this real quick and then I'm going
[544:16] to pull on the console and I'm going to
[544:19] show you the structure of the code there
[544:21] is a
[544:24] yeah I'll show you
[544:27] I wonder why yeah this isn't working
[544:29] anymore
[544:37] and
[544:39] here I have this stuff in here
[544:48] you're supposed to hide
[544:51] the stuff that overflows you bro you
[544:54] overclav
[544:56] what's up
[545:01] uh
[545:03] why are you overflowing
[545:08] maybe I can test without the simulator I
[545:10] think it's a safari
[545:12] issue
[545:35] all right they have two bugs in here
[545:38] it's book time yay
[545:42] all right this is a safari issue so we
[545:43] don't have to
[545:46] pull on the emulator we can just go on
[545:48] with this
[545:49] um console server is running
[545:52] maybe I'm even going to do something
[545:55] like that
[545:59] nope
[546:02] on the right please
[546:12] get off
[546:17] explain me why you overflow the
[546:19] container
[546:21] right I can't move you all right
[546:26] um
[546:36] see these are the said intakes
[546:41] okay okay the Z index [ __ ] up the
[546:44] thing
[546:50] Safari did not like my Z indexes
[546:53] um
[546:59] if I remove the Zen index now will I
[547:02] have any issue with this
[547:05] if one goes on top of the other
[547:09] oh actually there is no problem
[547:12] I just for fun we're gonna try tense
[547:15] on the one that is supposed to be
[547:16] blurred
[547:19] absolute
[547:22] or maybe I'll just do something simpler
[547:24] and I will say
[547:27] relative
[547:32] oh yeah of course no I cannot do that
[547:35] all right anyway it looks like there is
[547:36] no overlap actually it looks like it's
[547:38] working this guy has sunglasses playing
[547:42] a handball and he has sunglasses like
[547:45] looks like he's in the movie or
[547:47] something
[547:49] what up bro
[547:54] no let's zoom out
[547:58] okay I think we fixed it let's check in
[548:01] Chrome
[548:05] by the way I'm meant to ask for using
[548:07] for UI
[548:08] yep yep that's right it's using Daisy UI
[548:13] yeah
[548:19] okay it's still working okay we fixed
[548:21] one little bug
[548:24] and details
[548:26] right now we need
[548:30] uh I don't like Cube Safari
[548:33] I guess I have to play with you
[548:35] why are you
[548:37] showing me the previous avatar on the
[548:40] back
[548:44] you are cropped
[548:52] oh maybe I have an ID
[548:56] um oh I I need to do it as well here
[548:58] create Sports
[549:00] and we need to remove the exit index
[549:02] here as well
[549:07] um random emoji
[549:10] you have the Emoji size that is totally
[549:13] fine
[549:17] I really don't like Safari for the for
[549:20] coding
[549:22] I guess I'm not used to it
[549:24] um
[549:26] a sign up page
[549:30] the sign up page here create sport
[549:32] Avatar the random Emoji is supposed to
[549:35] be somewhere
[549:36] okay we have it here
[549:40] maybe it's the petting that makes an
[549:41] issue
[549:44] and maybe
[549:49] no I still have the issue with
[549:53] why are you showing me something
[549:57] earlier
[550:02] I think I don't really care
[550:08] hey it's showing the previous Emoji the
[550:10] one with the handlebar
[550:15] it looks like it's somehow there
[550:20] and if if it's too small for you guys to
[550:22] see it I'll try to zoom in
[550:26] it looks like sometimes the random emoji
[550:29] oh wow
[550:31] eight issues leading known all right
[550:37] um
[550:44] again
[550:48] yeah I know I think it's still happening
[550:52] that what I don't understand is that
[550:55] emoji is not even supposed to be there
[550:56] because
[550:59] see like it looks like it's printing the
[551:02] Emoji and it leave it there somehow and
[551:05] it's not even in the Dom like
[551:08] the one that is behind it
[551:15] ah
[551:25] all right I guess that's not a big deal
[551:34] right now it's not a big deal anyway
[551:37] thanks for the advice appreciate it
[551:40] I think we're gonna leave this in the
[551:42] weird bug category from Safari
[552:01] all right a close Safari for good night
[552:04] safari I'm gonna pretend uh this browser
[552:07] doesn't exist and I hope my iOS
[552:09] customers will not be used
[552:14] uh ding ding ding yeah it seems to be
[552:16] working fine okay
[552:20] you think because it's not even a
[552:22] picture
[552:24] see
[552:41] no it's still happening
[552:44] right now I think I'm gonna give up on
[552:46] this one this is not very important it's
[552:47] just the design
[552:49] stuff
[552:51] um
[552:53] what is going on here
[552:55] there's no change in this side bro
[552:58] there's a change there we go
[553:01] all right so I'm going to pull on my
[553:04] phone again oh maybe I'm gonna try to
[553:06] see if we have the issue on X codes in
[553:10] the simulator as well
[553:15] so normally it happens with the physical
[553:17] keyboard
[553:19] which we don't have here unless I ask uh
[553:23] keyboard
[553:28] use the same keyboard toggle software
[553:31] keyboard
[553:41] yes you're stuck here as well
[553:45] um okay we're gonna get a debug on
[553:46] Chrome because it's a bit
[553:48] easier
[553:52] on my phone
[553:59] hey
[554:01] our friendly Safari
[554:04] Chrome
[554:10] okay so there we go so here
[554:13] we have these
[554:16] View
[554:17] so what I do when I start project on
[554:20] capacitor because he uses 100 it should
[554:23] use I mean it has 100 of the view or
[554:26] tayden with
[554:28] until I add those things
[554:33] I add HTML
[554:35] minimum heat 100
[554:38] and
[554:40] 8 and I add also this for the Buddy
[554:43] um this is needed because on iOS there
[554:46] the viewport goes underneath the time
[554:50] and the notifications bars and stuff so
[554:53] I need to have make sure that it doesn't
[554:55] reach above those borders
[554:58] and so the hate would be 100 viewport
[555:03] and then
[555:05] there is no overflow and then here the
[555:08] body lets whatever inside
[555:11] its overflows
[555:13] and so if you go back we have our HTML
[555:17] here which is 100
[555:19] I pull on my keyboard still 100 and I
[555:21] remove my keyboard
[555:23] and see here like what's happening is
[555:24] like because I pulled on the keyboard
[555:27] and put it down and it pushed everything
[555:30] up
[555:31] um so the body is still 100
[555:35] and the next so the the div that next
[555:38] adds is somewhere pushed up
[555:43] and it doesn't go down
[555:46] and that's my issue
[555:48] and that's annoying because now I cannot
[555:50] do anything with the app and pull the
[555:52] keyboard by typing here but I cannot do
[555:54] anything else
[555:55] she's gonna get the app projected from
[555:58] the stores I'm pretty sure oh if I press
[556:00] any of those then I can pull it down but
[556:04] still it's not it's definitely not a
[556:06] good experience
[556:08] yeah because then after I push
[556:10] everything up okay
[556:12] so toasty fine this is my class name
[556:15] um so the documents it looks like this
[556:18] uh
[556:21] we have the buddy that's he's 100
[556:25] on my app
[556:26] last name
[556:28] I guess this is this
[556:39] and we have this stuff
[556:45] should we go bold and just say that
[556:49] this stuff should be
[556:53] the screen size
[557:04] then as we just did for this
[557:08] and let it overflow
[557:14] maybe I'm gonna I'm gonna do some tests
[557:17] on Chrome and bake a slower
[557:21] um
[557:27] yep yep I think we're in the same um
[557:31] um Perfection that's that's yeah that's
[557:35] what I'm trying to explore here
[557:38] so I'm going to
[557:42] uh I think what I'm gonna do is
[557:50] maybe if I pretend
[557:52] I pretend that the documents
[557:55] HTML
[558:00] uh
[558:03] we're gonna keep it this way
[558:07] maybe if I add a fake div here
[558:10] and I'm gonna pretend that this is you
[558:12] know the mobile app
[558:13] I'm gonna say like viewport eight uh
[558:16] eight
[558:18] if you work hate
[558:25] uh
[558:43] it's a bit strange
[558:45] okay because I think I put I hate screen
[558:48] no
[558:50] why I can do this I can
[558:55] this is a layer
[558:57] oh no no what wait
[559:01] I need a bathroom break I'll be back
[560:09] hateful
[560:14] eight full yep
[560:25] what does hateful does again 100 yeah
[560:30] and we have a layout but I think the
[560:32] layout is not here
[560:34] is
[560:36] I think it's okay so those don't matter
[560:43] um
[560:44] I think you just explain why
[560:48] order
[560:53] what is going on
[561:17] okay
[561:19] and now we're gonna do eight
[561:22] eight
[561:34] Scrolls
[561:38] uh
[561:40] we're just going to go in the loading
[561:41] page
[561:43] and
[561:56] all right I can try
[561:58] this
[562:07] next this is where we're gonna be
[562:14] and then we have our main here which is
[562:17] going to build overflow y
[562:20] 'all right I don't know if this is going
[562:21] to work we're gonna try
[562:23] and mobile
[562:36] are you gonna build it again
[562:43] my phone now
[562:45] um I push the screen up
[562:50] all right I got something
[562:52] I got a little something
[562:59] um I can show you my screen so you see
[563:02] what's going on
[563:04] from webview
[563:07] here you go so now that I have the
[563:10] Overflow
[563:11] uh when I type something so it pushes
[563:13] everything up
[563:15] and then when I
[563:17] whatever I do I click
[563:21] and then it pushes it back again so for
[563:26] now it looks like this is not too bad
[563:33] um we're going to create a fake account
[563:38] and they sign me up bro
[563:42] um so now if I create another Avatar
[563:46] and I do this and I try to create create
[563:48] Avatar
[563:54] yeah I cannot create it but at least the
[563:56] view is not [ __ ] up
[564:04] the leads
[564:09] um here we're going to try it again
[564:14] it looks like adding the Overflow fixed
[564:18] veneer
[564:19] oh no no I don't want to log out I don't
[564:21] remember my password
[564:23] ah you remember the password for me
[564:29] all right
[564:31] all right we're gonna check also on
[564:33] um
[564:34] iOS
[564:36] because that might make a little
[564:38] difference
[564:41] xcode
[564:42] hello Pearl
[564:45] um hey Mark when it comes to design do
[564:46] you do it yourself you work with this I
[564:48] do everything myself and but for this
[564:50] app especially I work with all of you
[564:53] guys who suggested some improvements
[564:56] and also with a menu a guy that has been
[565:00] on the thread a couple times
[565:02] and he's on Twitter and he's a really
[565:04] really good designer and he basically
[565:06] remade the whole app
[565:08] so now it looks cool
[565:11] oh I needed you with my wife phone
[565:13] [Music]
[565:14] forward to me I have to check back um
[565:18] maybe I can try just a keyboard
[565:24] oh I need to make it wait
[565:26] now that I have the app on my phone on
[565:28] Android I need to make sure the payment
[565:29] Works normally does
[565:33] um

[566:11] description of the video if you want to
[566:12] check it out
[566:17] and keyboard device using keyboard
[566:19] language use Hardware toggle software
[566:21] keyboard
[566:45] alrighty things like we don't have any
[566:48] issue that is good
[566:52] wait it's looking too fast I know okay I
[566:56] didn't click it that's why
[567:11] um let's see let's try the payment here
[567:13] again
[567:16] yep uh oh yeah I don't have the tests so
[567:19] I'll turn my wife's phone later
[567:28] all right I think it's working
[567:30] all right let's say it's working that
[567:32] was a line one line of code to fix that
[567:34] thing
[567:36] big weird
[567:38] bug
[567:41] bingo
[567:44] uh dingo fix inputs with their layouts
[567:48] this is done right tomorrow we'll do
[567:51] marketing maybe today just to finish the
[567:53] day we can add notifications
[567:58] local notifications I think for that
[568:00] local notifications capacitor I think
[568:02] capacitor is a plugin
[568:06] um
[568:10] and I think this is super awesome
[568:12] because you can it's set notifications
[568:15] uh
[568:17] schedule you can do something like
[568:24] schedule
[568:26] option let me get better get it again
[568:29] I delete certification at a time
[568:33] um that's yeah
[568:35] on oh yeah you can do this you can do
[568:37] repeats notifications so I can send
[568:39] notification daily at nine a.m for
[568:41] instance
[568:42] Android
[568:48] on
[568:49] and we can add chromes
[568:53] hey hey
[568:57] can you
[569:02] um
[569:07] right so the guy won't work out I mean
[569:11] it's work out maybe three times a week
[569:13] and you want to receive a notification
[569:15] chickens have it
[569:20] I think I will not bother too much at
[569:22] the beginning and I will just do
[569:25] a daily notification
[569:28] so wherever
[569:32] um it doesn't matter
[569:34] you know how how much you work out
[569:36] you're gonna get if you want you can set
[569:38] up a daily notification at whatever time
[569:40] you want
[569:43] which means that on my ad Avatar page
[569:46] create Avatar
[569:48] create sport
[569:53] and here you'll be able to receive a
[569:55] notification
[569:59] um go per week
[570:08] oh are we gonna set up those
[570:10] notifications you need to set up uh
[570:31] schedule on
[570:33] maybe you can just remind me on
[570:36] Monday
[570:38] at that
[570:41] all right so I get a little bit of work
[570:43] here
[570:44] constant uh
[570:46] as notification
[570:49] that has notification application
[570:53] we use dates bubbles

[572:18] item Center
[572:21] text accents phones
[572:26] semi bold
[572:29] um
[572:43] not super good looking
[572:48] uh maybe we need a plus
[572:51] and
[572:57] add notification
[573:00] uh margin
[573:04] one personal order
[573:15] adding y cursive pointer and
[573:16] notification okay
[573:18] do something like this and on click it's
[573:21] gonna say uh
[573:24] sets has notification
[573:29] as notification no notification proof
[573:36] I'm gonna be gone okay
[573:39] how is this gonna look like you want to
[573:43] pick the day
[573:44] and you want to pick the time I guess
[573:52] give me a sec
[574:01] uh
[574:15] you could use the picture yep yep yep
[574:20] and
[574:24] that terrified maybe reminder
[574:26] notification
[574:28] and here uh HTML date picker
[574:34] what is the default type date oh yeah
[574:41] oh I need a Time picker HTML time
[574:43] feature
[575:06] type okay
[575:08] the easy UI please tell me you have a
[575:11] component like this
[575:13] input I don't think you have now
[575:17] input the text input input group nope
[575:28] uh maybe data
[575:30] data inputs type input toggle select
[575:35] no okay
[576:06] maybe just a Time picker and we can
[576:09] react see
[576:19] there's your react date picker okay
[576:22] I have this one time picker I think
[576:25] it's secure
[576:28] I'll just check because um well maybe
[576:31] this one
[576:32] GPD that's the answer to everything
[576:39] oh I checked it out before
[576:42] perfect
[577:07] just a date picker please
[577:14] get bigger
[577:18] that's cute honestly it's not that
[577:22] yeah okay I don't understand how that
[577:24] works
[577:25] uh maybe we'll just need the date native
[577:28] HTML stuff
[577:31] uh so if he doesn't have notification
[577:34] maybe I'll just do the react
[577:38] react time
[577:39] here
[577:41] uh
[577:46] you know what week I'm working on um I
[577:48] think we're done with all the features
[577:50] of the app the landing page is ready a
[577:53] fixed this stuff
[577:56] and tomorrow will be marketing day
[577:59] making the product demo video and
[578:00] scheduling all the product and stuff
[578:02] there are two things that I think are
[578:04] valuable for the adverse is the getting
[578:06] daily notifications to tick your habit
[578:08] and the second one is a public profile
[578:12] um I think notifications is more
[578:14] important so I'm going to set this up
[578:17] today if I can at 5 p.m yeah I'll try to
[578:19] do it in one hour or two before I go off
[578:21] and then tomorrow we'll move on with
[578:23] this and the apps have been submitted on
[578:25] the stores Apple iOS Android and iOS
[578:29] um we're still waiting for their review
[578:31] I know it's probably never gonna be um
[578:33] accepted first time but um there's
[578:35] something
[578:42] okay
[578:43] um
[578:45] what is what is what is what is the
[578:47] default time picker so if you don't have
[578:50] notification
[578:52] I'm gonna have this form
[578:56] and
[578:59] um inputs

[579:09] wait uh
[579:47] what do you usually do after 10 hours of
[579:50] long cutting session
[579:51] um normally I would surf but today the
[579:54] waves are not don't seem to be good this
[579:57] windy
[579:59] um otherwise I will just work out at
[580:02] home

[580:15] and we're gonna keep the D for now
[580:18] um
[580:21] kind reminder
[580:24] input type
[580:29] uh does that look like
[580:35] okay it's quite ugly but it's okay oh
[580:38] yeah because we need capacitoring we
[580:40] need to put this only on mobile
[580:42] uh it's okay
[581:29] we add uh
[581:32] my time class name
[581:35] what does that do
[581:37] okay we have some kind of control around
[581:40] it
[581:41] yeah
[581:43] okay
[581:45] we have some controls that's fine
[581:49] um
[581:50] in line
[581:53] with 50 with 24.
[582:07] and change
[582:12] it's all about log dot e Dot
[582:16] Target dot value let's see what's going
[582:19] on in there
[582:25] um oh yeah
[582:30] no idea what's going to happen I've
[582:33] never used a beaker before okay it's
[582:35] friendly
[582:39] all right
[582:40] remind me at blah blah blah
[582:46] all right
[582:52] uh
[582:58] okay and here value
[583:00] [Music]
[583:02] instance
[583:05] notification at at
[583:09] notifications
[583:21] up
[583:27] um I'm just trying to see the first time
[583:30] I use a Time picker
[583:32] so I don't know if I'm gonna be able to
[583:34] do something that works
[583:37] with a just controlled HTML stuff
[583:42] let's see
[583:44] all right it seems to be working we have
[583:46] a control components
[583:49] we give it a little padding of Y Maybe
[583:52] yeah that's friendly
[584:01] I'm just curious how that looks on the
[584:03] phone I'm gonna build it and try try it
[584:07] here
[584:23] that's what you're doing nice curious
[584:25] what's your main source of income now
[584:27] um I if you want
[584:30] I share this on Twitter
[584:32] I have two apps I have one that is
[584:36] called
[584:37] spirally Bots
[584:40] yeah I'm just going to build this in the
[584:41] meantime I have this app that I quit
[584:44] running I'm not running it anymore but
[584:46] this is making something between six to
[584:48] eight hundred dollars a month
[584:51] the other app is this
[584:54] um
[584:56] um happy tracker with a subscription
[584:58] this is making
[585:00] somewhere ranging from 400 to 600 a
[585:03] month
[585:04] that's pretty much all my comments
[585:06] sometimes if I'm lucky I get a customer
[585:08] on 50 hacks or you can buy a sponsorship
[585:11] shop sponsorship
[585:13] spots for 200.
[585:16] a month
[585:22] okay
[585:25] they pick here on my phone
[585:27] all right on my phone
[585:30] the reminder ads is just absolutely
[585:33] empty I guess I'm gonna have to do some
[585:35] work with that
[585:36] but it's working then if I click on it I
[585:39] have this
[585:43] this is nice I think it's just a matter
[585:45] oh yeah just a matter of background
[585:47] color
[585:48] I think if I just puts inputs I um
[585:52] type equal time
[585:56] here
[585:58] um
[585:59] IC BG please
[586:05] that should work
[586:08] um
[586:08] so yeah I can pick the time it's quite
[586:10] nice quite nice
[586:33] yep okay it's working
[586:35] um and let's see on Android and iOS
[586:52] yeah same we have the issue with the
[586:54] color here
[586:55] and at least yeah same we have a name
[586:58] that's dope
[587:03] that's super dope
[587:06] has much simpler than Authority it
[587:08] doesn't it even looks great
[587:15] nice
[587:17] um I'm going to rebuild it making sure
[587:18] that the background issue is fixed
[587:20] otherwise users will never find
[587:22] that thing
[587:25] and then I'm going to move on with
[587:27] capacitor
[587:30] in the meantime
[587:34] try it again
[587:40] yeah okay
[587:53] oh maybe if I put zero zero oh no no no
[587:56] then he's gonna set up a notification
[588:17] if I do something like uh related
[588:22] I do cutting left eight or margin eight
[588:28] I don't know maybe pending left eight
[588:40] even twelve
[588:42] I'm gonna do something just a little bit
[588:45] dirty you can say the default value for
[588:47] the color because it hasn't changed
[588:49] yeah yeah I have something similar in
[588:52] mind I'm going to show you
[588:54] um
[588:56] I had just a little idea
[589:00] if there is no value inside of it I
[589:03] thought I would add a
[589:07] ear related
[589:16] input here
[589:18] and here I would add this stuff
[589:22] notification
[589:27] that's
[589:29] there's no notification
[589:32] you can add this and this is going to
[589:34] still to stand as absolute
[589:40] absolute
[589:41] left zero top zero I'm gonna have to
[589:45] change this a little bit left up
[589:50] to translate
[589:53] y 1.2
[589:54] [Music]
[590:00] something like this a little you know
[590:03] plus
[590:04] if you don't have it then when you say
[590:06] once you set it up
[590:09] uh
[590:10] oh then the padding is [ __ ] up oh
[590:13] just eight Maybe
[590:19] oh yeah because I put yeah okay this is
[590:21] my mistake here
[590:34] all right I think that could work
[590:37] hey it's in the middle
[590:40] not perfect but it's uh I don't know
[590:42] it's working
[590:44] uh if you set up your notification
[590:47] here
[590:49] and then I need to add a minus sign
[590:53] thank you buddy I'll add this sign here
[590:55] on the side of it that's um
[591:01] if
[591:04] has a notification that
[591:08] so then if he has a notification then
[591:11] you can delete it
[591:14] um same I think I'm going to make it
[591:15] relative
[591:17] right minus four
[591:21] up zero
[591:24] trans of 1.12 Translate
[591:30] one two

[592:12] you're supposed to be on the right now
[592:16] or maybe it doesn't detect the
[592:22] oh
[592:24] in line
[592:27] um
[592:38] oh maybe I should set the width on this
[592:41] guy
[592:42] and not on this guy
[592:56] 32
[593:00] um
[593:01] hey hey buddy what's going on
[593:05] you're 30. so here you should have a
[593:07] width
[593:11] okay
[593:15] but then you're still not at the right
[593:17] place my friend
[593:21] it's better yeah I can do something like
[593:24] this
[593:25] I just I just feel don't you feel it's
[593:26] weird that this
[593:29] or maybe it's not in the re oh okay
[593:34] I get it it's not in the inside div
[593:38] wait it's still working
[593:42] what
[593:43] wait I don't get it
[593:48] I have my inputs
[593:51] I have my notification ads
[593:54] this is supposed to be
[593:57] here
[593:59] release oh absolute
[594:02] dingo dingo okay
[594:05] all right
[594:06] minus four
[594:09] minus eight
[594:13] okay
[594:14] there we go that's working now
[594:18] um and actually that should be a button
[594:22] um
[594:27] Plus
[594:28] a turn button ghost
[594:32] button SM
[594:34] absolute
[594:39] okay and unclick
[594:43] we're gonna do sit uh notification
[594:48] set has notification
[594:51] set the notification ads
[594:54] nothing
[594:58] okay
[595:05] that's so weird you're supposed to ah
[595:16] unchanged
[595:50] oh okay that's why this one was clicked
[595:54] by default
[596:01] okay
[596:04] so we have this remind me that we go
[596:09] and then we remove it
[596:11] we add one more
[596:14] and we remove it okay
[596:19] the signature is gonna go yeah oh yeah
[596:22] yeah you got it for me it made it away
[596:28] all right so let's see how that works on
[596:31] iOS
[596:33] yep fix now
[596:37] debugging together it's fun oh the plus
[596:39] oh yeah because I didn't revealed okay
[596:41] here
[596:43] let's try it again
[596:47] mobile
[596:50] I think I'm gonna make these as you said
[596:52] a reusable components because it doesn't
[596:55] make any API calls
[596:58] and I'm going to need the component
[596:59] three times
[597:01] probably I'm gonna export it
[597:11] all right that's cool
[597:24] but it's not perfect but it is working
[597:30] um right now we need some logic
[597:33] um yeah I'm gonna make these components
[597:36] let's say a time figure
[597:43] of option
[597:45] you go time bigger
[597:48] and we're gonna say
[597:59] um
[598:24] and so here I can import
[598:38] foreign
[598:48] there
[598:52] if I can be here is here and now I can
[598:55] save that thing
[598:58] and you're back
[599:00] also going to import
[599:02] um
[599:05] pass it over
[599:12] and also use effect
[599:19] and I am
[599:22] going to make sure that this doesn't
[599:25] show on HTML
[599:26] [Music]
[599:29] and if maybe is shown
[599:40] use State false
[599:44] if capacitor that is native platform
[599:49] set is shown equal to true
[599:56] and here if
[599:59] not shown
[600:04] nothing and for the sake of the demo we
[600:07] are going to do this
[600:09] [Music]
[600:12] so
[600:13] you can add ear notification and you can
[600:16] delete it
[600:21] um and now I need to install the local
[600:23] notifications from
[600:26] this
[600:28] and pme
[600:32] Bingo and a capsync
[600:37] hidden Vision won't be won't be exact
[600:39] unless this permission is added to the
[600:40] Manifest
[600:45] okay
[600:52] Android manifest
[600:55] Generation boy I don't think it's a
[600:58] really big deal in here
[601:07] um
[601:11] lip sync
[601:16] some icon
[603:00] as we're going to read
[603:06] trade
[603:08] S I think it's in a setup
[603:13] course Main
[603:15] res
[603:21] drawable I see stats logo Android
[603:34] hmm
[603:36] trouble API
[603:43] okay
[603:45] um
[603:46] Android app
[603:49] go icon maker I forget how you call that
[603:54] um
[603:56] create app icons I think that's the one
[604:00] oh maybe capacitor will actually tell me
[604:04] it was no that you tell me capacitor
[604:09] small icon
[604:11] no you don't want to tell me
[604:14] no
[604:17] image asset Studio Maybe
[604:20] uh
[604:24] Android image
[604:26] videos you have gone sleep waking up and
[604:29] you're still programming your Beast mark
[604:31] good morning sir hey Camille
[604:36] a dream
[604:37] what was the name for
[604:39] uh is a website an Android where you can
[604:43] turn icons into whatever stuff they need
[604:46] to display notifications
[604:52] me too I gotta sleep and you're still
[604:54] here yay
[604:58] durable resources
[605:13] is it no
[605:16] all right I think it's maybe
[605:22] accent color
[605:24] Android asset Studio the clipboard for
[605:28] example no
[605:32] yes okay I'm gonna add this somewhere in
[605:37] mobile apps so I remember next time
[605:42] um
[605:47] your feet public logo
[605:50] [Music]
[605:53] oh yeah because I think I need yeah I
[605:56] need to transfer an image okay
[606:09] I think I need some peanut butter
[606:16] all right that's Mr logo and we are
[606:19] going to
[606:22] have field
[606:25] and Export it maybe without the shadow
[606:27] otherwise it might get [ __ ] up
[606:32] port
[606:34] logos
[606:37] logo transparents
[606:44] um nope
[606:48] a little bit transparent
[606:54] ah yeah there we go
[606:57] uh so normally we have the icon
[607:00] somewhere
[607:03] somewhere somewhere somewhere
[607:12] [Music]
[607:13] actually this is way too much
[607:17] Android
[607:20] app
[607:22] Force main
[607:25] res drawable
[607:30] and we get this
[607:33] and that
[607:35] I don't know where I should place it
[607:42] um drawable xx60i maybe we're just going
[607:45] to try to put all that in there
[607:47] looks like there's no conflict
[607:51] okay
[607:53] look at this Tech Deck
[607:56] um what is the name of it in time bigger
[607:59] remind me at
[608:03] you press plus you get your notification
[608:10] oh yes no yes
[608:15] um
[608:19] a bigger
[608:25] oh yeah yeah of course you need to give
[608:28] me your
[608:29] idea
[608:34] uh nope
[608:36] just an idea like this and in here it
[608:39] creates Sports
[608:52] you are going to give me the sport ID
[608:54] that you have
[608:56] so
[608:59] or
[609:03] 40 bus Port ID
[609:06] when you set the time picture you want
[609:08] to give me the ID to be the sport name
[609:11] so then I can know the notification is
[609:15] in the local storage and I know the ID
[609:17] so I can just delete it
[609:22] which means which means which were
[609:25] nutrient chains
[609:31] all right we're gonna do it
[609:33] um
[609:38] add oh no no no I said the one
[609:41] here we are going to
[609:47] do set notification
[609:52] which is going to be our function set
[609:55] set notification
[609:59] of up
[610:01] up
[610:09] uh oh no it's not the same Kindle
[610:11] notification
[610:13] handle notification
[610:24] and no notification
[610:26] so we set the notification ads as a
[610:28] value that's the first step
[610:31] then we'll need to check user permission
[610:37] um we need to add flow so ask
[610:43] ask if no permission
[610:49] then we will add schedule
[610:53] application
[611:01] okay let's start with that
[611:04] MP and kept sync okay
[611:09] um let's keep this Tech Deck
[611:14] okay
[611:15] um we are going to check or enabled
[611:21] big weather or no enabled free channel
[611:24] list three check permissions request
[611:26] permissions
[611:28] check permission and request permission
[611:34] so we're gonna do
[611:36] um
[611:39] import local
[611:42] what is the name of it
[611:45] local notification
[611:49] import local notifications in here
[611:53] I'm gonna do
[611:55] it's a sink is it promise yep so wait
[612:00] look on notifications that check
[612:02] permissions
[612:04] and it's supposed to return permission
[612:06] status
[612:08] display version
[612:11] state but
[612:14] display
[612:16] versus state
[612:19] Ocean State prompt prompt with rational
[612:21] granted denied
[612:25] so I guess from
[612:28] both
[612:30] supposed to have of the display
[612:35] is it correct
[612:39] this is gonna be
[612:49] jumped with rational granted
[612:52] so I'm gonna assume I'm gonna console
[612:54] log that thing first of all
[612:56] I'm gonna probably even do this play
[613:03] also.log display
[613:07] um here if display equal granted
[613:14] I'm gonna need an error constant set
[613:18] as error
[613:21] sit here
[613:23] use state
[613:28] oh
[613:31] so here
[613:37] if okay if it's granted
[613:40] no
[613:42] if
[613:44] it's uh display
[613:46] equal night
[613:50] all right yep we're gonna do set error
[613:53] uh please
[613:55] below notifications
[614:01] and we are going to have uh
[614:06] label somewhere
[614:10] able label Alt
[614:15] text error
[614:23] here okay
[614:26] and else this means that we are in
[614:29] prompt
[614:30] we're gonna do
[614:32] a weight local notification.ask
[614:39] gets permission no what was the name
[614:45] request permission
[614:47] and we get back listen for what
[614:49] notifications are displayed
[614:56] request permission this is the local
[614:58] notifications
[615:05] okay it's exactly the same thing
[615:08] um display is it correct
[615:12] permission status yeah permission says
[615:14] okay
[615:17] um printed
[615:19] here we do constant display equal await
[615:21] request
[615:24] permissions
[615:28] okay
[615:32] install Dot log display
[615:38] so here we're going to have a nested
[615:40] function same that's going to be if this
[615:44] oh maybe display as display
[615:48] or display two
[616:08] um
[616:10] okay
[616:18] all right there's a lot of stuff to
[616:20] process so I'm going to build it
[616:24] and see where we are now
[617:03] okay
[617:05] and the notification uh seems like
[617:09] input on change handle notification
[617:15] display
[617:18] uh it seems like nothing has actually
[617:21] worked
[617:29] level up do we have an error somewhere
[617:35] sorry Siri I don't want you
[617:39] console see you later
[617:43] in five variable e

[635:29] I don't understand the documentation
[635:32] so
[635:34] yeah so they say it's similar to
[635:36] scheduling Chrome jobs but then when I
[635:38] go to the schedule on
[635:40] I don't know if I can put on a star
[635:43] do a chrome job
[635:45] so I I don't know the structure of how
[635:48] my object should look like
[635:52] I want to repeat the notification every
[635:54] day at a specific time
[636:00] I wear a weekday
[636:04] so maybe I can just maybe I take
[636:06] everything
[636:08] uh
[636:16] maybe hit yeah they say it's a number
[636:19] yeah there's a problem here they say
[636:21] it's supposed to be a number
[636:23] but what if I want to repeat every year
[636:29] maybe also by default it repeats
[636:34] so it's it's honestly it's a bit this is
[636:37] a bit um confusing
[636:40] now we can start with this the power
[636:41] will be the notification at
[636:47] oh actually
[636:49] e Dot targets.value
[636:55] um that's lit
[636:59] and we're gonna split those
[637:03] I'm gonna say this is going to be the
[637:05] zero
[637:09] and the minutes
[637:12] will be these at one
[637:15] but for the rest of them I don't know
[637:17] what to put on there
[637:23] um
[637:29] repeat
[637:31] is true
[637:35] every week
[637:37] on day
[637:39] day one
[637:45] oh wait so the okay so it repeats okay
[637:47] every week
[637:51] every maybe every day because I want
[637:54] users are supposed to repeat to get it
[637:56] every day
[638:04] no I that's why it's confusing man it's
[638:07] you can either use at on or every
[638:11] so on your example you're using on day
[638:15] one
[638:16] then do every
[638:18] week will not work
[638:20] that's why I find it confusing is I can
[638:22] only use on
[638:26] the repeat stuff only work with ads
[638:30] so the only option I have is either I
[638:32] use add plus repeat which is not gonna
[638:34] work
[638:36] every schedule on schedule
[638:46] foreign
[638:52] this is what I have weekday
[638:58] that's why I'm trying to find if some
[639:00] people have tried you know to do like
[639:03] tutorials or
[639:05] just to have a quick idea of how that on
[639:08] works
[639:13] every on
[639:15] oh shooting simulators
[639:29] yeah all the documentation and examples
[639:32] are about other stuff
[639:34] chocolate
[639:40] maybe ionic oh yeah someone did an
[639:43] example
[639:45] or these records or the app
[639:48] so the guy here is having an issue is
[639:51] getting everything
[639:52] [Music]
[639:56] he's not currently primary goes on and
[639:59] every option chosen together
[640:01] and there is no one who fixed it now
[640:08] all right so the guy is looping over all
[640:10] the month
[640:12] [ __ ]
[640:13] schedule ads a little while little and
[640:16] this is not cool
[640:21] Institute on and on right I'm gonna just
[640:24] banish the duck
[640:30] keep you
[640:40] all right nothing in there
[640:45] the ads
[640:57] Arch either
[641:04] [Music]
[641:09] yeah and also if how does every work
[641:17] every day
[641:22] or maybe the key
[641:25] monies what's up welcome to
[641:37] hello
[641:50] what general
[641:55] all right bathroom break I'll be back
[643:35] oh this I think it's time for our

[643:49] Waldo come on we gotta we gotta upload
[643:52] that thing
[643:55] you guys want to support
[643:57] um it's a project from someone who has
[643:59] been showing up on the live many times
[644:00] and he's the guy who did all the designs
[644:04] of the app I did all that
[644:08] uh his name
[644:10] is on Twitter and he's launching today
[644:13] if you guys want to support he's a
[644:15] really cool guy

[645:19] we might have something
[645:27] all right bro show me show me show me
[645:31] foreign
[645:47] I think I'm gonna have to dig through
[645:48] the node.js modules and read the code
[645:53] super fun
[645:55] notification you are
[645:59] you are
[646:01] capacitor you're not here you're here
[646:04] yeah local notifications
[646:08] um
[646:13] I feel dizzy just looking at the code
[646:17] oh nice
[646:18] what is this what is okay
[646:21] uh
[646:24] schedule
[646:59] and no that's not gonna be there
[647:04] hello
[647:06] a new Twitter name okay bro I'm checking
[647:08] this right now
[647:15] schedule random ID at
[647:19] in a minute repeats through every day
[647:26] I don't think it's gonna work for for
[647:28] the same reason you can't use repeats
[647:32] um
[647:33] this is why
[647:36] at on every
[647:40] that's every here you have ads in every
[647:45] and those two they say just it's not
[647:48] um what they say here is that it's not
[647:50] gonna work
[647:59] damn it
[648:02] capacitor maybe local notification ionic
[648:06] example
[648:08] maybe ionic has a documentation that
[648:11] could be friendly
[648:21] okay that's all again
[648:38] you don't have anything for me all right
[648:51] yeah it's the same condition
[648:55] damn it
[649:02] [Music]
[649:02] um
[649:05] maybe ionic
[649:07] how to send daily notification
[649:13] and interesting location every day at a
[649:16] specific time ah
[649:17] we might have something here
[649:25] use either
[649:30] I think
[649:32] all right I'm gonna keep these on the
[649:33] side but um
[649:36] all right I just checked this one maybe
[649:37] there's something interesting here
[649:40] you do
[649:42] your
[649:45] I know still no
[649:47] first date
[649:50] dang
[650:21] oh
[650:24] a store
[650:42] yeah they use at and every
[650:46] seriously
[650:48] use either
[650:52] maybe you're right so maybe actually
[650:54] maybe actually we could use several
[651:07] I just tried every
[651:40] all right I'm turning your code bro
[651:43] if it works
[651:45] super amazing
[652:02] these uh
[652:04] maybe I need just to add Plus
[652:13] hello
[652:31] [Music]
[652:35] are you ready
[652:43] this
[653:02] uh check permissions I think it's gonna
[653:04] tell me I don't have them
[653:07] results
[653:09] in idea I just need to authorized
[653:15] [Music]
[653:16] um
[653:20] you can use
[653:26] better
[653:29] we have 18
[653:33] local notification schedule notification
[653:36] missing identifier
[653:41] oh
[653:44] oh maybe he's missing identifier maybe
[653:47] that's the only thing that's missing
[653:50] would be great
[653:55] I'm just going to console log what I'm
[653:57] sending
[654:00] and here we're gonna do whatever
[654:04] that's random
[654:10] why is it 18
[654:26] here we go again
[655:00] missing notification missing events fair
[655:02] so there is something wrong

[655:16] give this
[655:19] ID
[655:31] what is this
[655:36] oh

[656:14] if there's another way because
[656:19] uh How can I
[656:22] because I need to know the user has
[656:24] these notifications for these workouts
[656:27] specifically so then I can delete if the
[656:30] user doesn't want notification anymore
[656:35] because I think to cancel notifications
[656:37] to remove them
[656:41] cancel pending notification
[656:47] remove listener how do I stop one please
[656:50] Channel delete channel okay deliver
[656:52] remove deliver notification removed
[656:55] and depending
[656:57] delete notification Channel
[657:00] nope
[657:02] so the only way
[657:05] is to cancel
[657:09] notification description

[657:18] a notification
[657:28] the notification identifier

[657:59] turn gym into a whatever straight number
[658:07] how did not return
[658:10] uh
[658:13] string to number
[658:18] Card Exchange number
[658:28] how to encode change

[664:33] we're gonna run this on mobile
[664:36] we're going to schedule it repeats every
[664:38] day at this time
[664:44] and uh
[664:47] yep okay
[664:50] I don't know if you're still here but
[664:51] maybe uh you're bored of me doing some
[664:55] mistakes
[664:57] I don't understand
[665:05] simulator and we are going to log all
[665:08] that let's see
[665:14] enable to create notification trigger
[665:16] fails all right so that's another error
[665:18] and there
[665:20] I hope it works

[665:23] enable to create a tradition trigger
[665:25] failed
[665:28] what is the trigger
[665:34] figure filled
[665:36] unable to create notification trigger

[665:45] sounds like uh these stuff all together
[665:47] don't
[665:49] like each other

[667:15] this thing I should repeat every count
[667:18] of the
[667:25] ah I don't know if you can see my screen
[667:28] I found the code where
[667:30] this schedule the notification it's
[667:33] pretty dirty
[667:36] or someone who doesn't speak the Swift
[667:38] language
[667:40] maybe there's something here
[667:43] uh at eight components
[667:46] must be after the current time
[667:52] date in a row
[668:01] oh
[668:04] on gate day components so here it's
[668:07] gonna call this given our schedule for
[668:09] marriage return date of server that
[668:11] containing component invested
[668:24] and you might say oh
[668:30] great info year
[668:39] yep
[668:41] same for Indonesia six six a.m something
[668:51] 18 for City components
[669:27] eight components
[669:31] foreign
[670:58] there you go
[671:16] hello hello summits
[671:27] capacitor
[671:33] the beat
[671:49] butter hey
[671:55] repeats
[671:57] radial group is true every two weeks on
[672:16] so I want to increase her day
[672:19] I did something since day is day 12.
[672:23] notification with
[672:26] and I set the phone date
[672:34] reservation
[672:37] hey Google turn on the bedroom lights
[672:43] bedroom light brightness to 100 percent
[672:56] is struggling with a very similar the
[672:58] case is even simpler
[673:27] repeat on your place
[673:48] maybe I'm overthinking it
[673:52] you read your day is awake what's
[673:54] missing here
[673:56] maybe I'm just overthinking it maybe
[673:58] just schedule
[674:03] on
[674:06] our targeted as plead zero
[674:10] uh
[674:12] DMS again okay bro I'm gonna just
[674:15] try this one real quick
[674:41] that's the
[674:45] schedule
[674:57] on
[674:59] yeah there's something here right let me
[675:01] check this real quick
[675:23] remind me at
[675:26] I schedule it for six uh
[675:30] 26 let's see
[675:36] I know I cannot
[675:38] um now let me delete this boy here
[675:43] at a notification
[675:45] I'm gonna unboxing
[675:48] and we're gonna remind
[675:52] well I think it's working bro
[675:56] it's risky the labor minutes you can
[675:58] probably change this to every day okay
[676:01] and then definitely check this I think
[676:03] I'm gonna check if I receive a
[676:04] notification it looks like it's working
[676:07] at least it looks like one at least I
[676:09] could schedule like the stuff didn't
[676:11] complain
[676:12] the capacitor another gun notification
[676:15] results
[676:17] notification id2
[676:20] I think it had it have been scheduled
[676:23] let's wait until the
[676:26] it's uh
[676:29] time
[676:33] 6 27 it has not been
[676:36] no
[676:38] please send me that notification
[676:45] [ __ ]
[676:46] I was hoping that was really hopeful
[676:50] and just check I have notifications are
[676:52] loaded yeah I do have them
[676:56] hello you said
[677:00] yeah I do every minute
[677:04] notification current features schedule
[677:06] every minute
[677:11] every every every every
[677:18] gig of Avery
[677:24] but do you think then okay
[677:31] how do how do I because then I will have
[677:34] to mix every and at right
[677:38] because otherwise
[677:41] what does every minute says for or every
[677:44] day
[677:50] this is wait
[678:01] um
[678:07] maybe I can also check maybe I'm just I
[678:11] just messed up with the time maybe I did
[678:13] it can I put on a wrong
[678:16] whatever uh
[678:20] big permissions
[678:23] schedule
[678:28] so I give you this and I told you you
[678:30] scheduled power off maybe that's also
[678:32] the mistake here because I I put on a
[678:34] number
[678:37] or maybe it's not a big deal
[678:50] kill every 90 seconds every counts
[679:27] foreign
[680:51] damn
[680:53] ah
[681:36] and maybe I just here I just made a
[681:38] mistake in a code
[681:43] uh
[681:51] plates so the notification
[681:55] notification hour and minutes
[682:06] nope
[682:13] that should be a number this might be a
[682:16] mistake
[682:19] or minutes
[682:22] uh
[682:55] gets pending notification have you tried
[682:57] using on the on yep that's what I'm
[682:59] trying now I think it does work
[683:01] um maybe I just
[683:03] put it the wrong way I'm gonna give it
[683:06] another try
[683:07] and
[683:18] so maybe this needs to be a number
[683:26] remember
[683:30] and I'm going to add a little
[683:34] um
[683:46] click
[683:48] there's a lot of little functions it's
[683:50] going to say uh
[683:53] local notifications
[683:56] cool
[684:00] notifications
[684:02] dot ending
[684:05] that then
[684:23] right as a local notifications okay
[684:27] I'm gonna
[684:29] try something else and also I'm going to
[684:32] try to log
[684:36] um which notifications are pending to
[684:38] see maybe we have some data about how
[684:40] they've been scheduled
[684:46] I made
[684:52] I think there will be the end of the
[684:54] Stream
[685:20] hello I have two pending notifications
[685:22] so we managed to schedule them
[685:26] they're here buddy extra nothing
[685:28] schedule on minutes
[685:33] I agreement that documentation is pretty
[685:35] terrible
[685:39] um right let's schedule another sport
[685:43] and let's say uh 38. I'd go crazy
[685:58] okay
[685:59] and now if I do get pinning I have

[693:29] objective with ID
[693:31] thank you local notifications cancel

[693:51] which is
[693:53] import vinegar
[694:00] is it fixed or not uh
[694:06] looks like it's fixed and we need
[694:09] another thing
[694:12] which is we need to know
[694:18] we can't we can add notifications we can
[694:21] cancel the notification
[694:23] and we need to be able also to check
[694:26] if you have a notification already
[694:29] because now we assume you don't
[694:32] need to do something like use effects
[694:37] and
[694:40] I'm gonna have to check
[694:43] gets pending
[694:49] press
[694:57] in my use effects I want to check if
[695:00] I'm going to do constants
[695:02] um

[695:49] are we gonna do this
[695:51] and okay you don't like this install it
[695:54] checkpointing a sync
[696:02] it's an integration that's going to take
[696:04] this and then raise the notifications is
[696:08] what we're gonna get back I guess
[696:12] we have this array and we're going to
[696:15] need to do like a fine index
[696:18] for these array
[696:21] apres
[696:24] notifications

[696:48] notification notification dot ID
[696:51] if it's equal equal to
[696:54] um
[696:55] number
[696:58] integer ID integer

[697:20] existing existing notification equal
[697:26] press notification that find
[697:28] ification ID equal the current one word
[697:32] check-in
[697:33] and then

[697:38] going to do if existing notification
[697:41] are gonna set up
[697:43] notification and
[697:49] um
[697:51] and we're going to do
[697:54] what does that look like again

[698:24] existing notification that schedule
[698:28] dots
[698:30] power and minute
[698:37] I don't want to mess it up so I'm going
[698:39] to do this
[698:41] thing
[698:44] and
[698:47] a minute
[698:50] all right and over here we do a check
[698:53] training
[699:03] okay ID integer
[699:11] all right so here we check if you have a
[699:13] local notifications and if that's the
[699:15] case
[699:17] we set it up so you can actually remove
[699:20] it because here you have a notification
[699:23] that then you can remove it and then you
[699:25] can call that other function
[699:30] alrighty right oh
[699:35] should we try to build that you should
[699:39] mobile
[699:41] oh and of course we need to change the
[699:43] notification title
[699:46] um I don't
[699:51] forget
[699:56] Archer
[699:58] level up
[700:02] your workout

[701:52] so here we seem not to have a workout we
[701:56] can set up something for this time
[701:59] we want to remove it
[702:09] it's an M Maybe
[702:15] ID integer
[702:18] maybe I want to log that things
[702:23] video on the log
[702:26] console.log
[702:30] resident with notifications
[702:34] I think that would be helpful
[702:38] so I don't know if
[702:42] if I add one here oh yeah yeah he finds
[702:45] it I think he finds it
[702:47] so here there is
[702:49] no I know you're not supposed to do that
[702:55] um
[702:59] oh okay
[703:01] oh yeah because I changed the ID integer
[703:03] it's my check pending
[703:05] get pending
[703:18] oh if there are no pending oh so either
[703:21] notifications Red Dot fine I find the
