[00:01] okay so this weekend project made a
[00:03] million dollar after 18 months just
[00:06] build whatever you have in mind we're
[00:08] going to leave Val and we're going to
[00:09] travel all over the world it's time to
[00:11] work boom a freaking million dollars get
[00:14] the weekend project this is a website
[00:16] build something build it fast code code
[00:19] code and then repeat over and over and
[00:21] over this is the freaking
[00:24] [Music]
[00:27] date meet Mark Lou a millionaire who
[00:30] owns exactly zero pairs of shoes and way
[00:33] more startups than you'd think is
[00:35] reasonable he sits here in this
[00:37] disgustingly beautiful Tropical Paradise
[00:40] to show you how to turn ideas into
[00:42] Brands strangers into clients and your
[00:45] boring job into a distant memory
[00:48] [Music]
[01:01] good
[01:02] morning good morning in doing the food
[01:11] we uh that would be a good thumbnail
[01:14] just came back to Bali full jet lag but
[01:16] it's time to
[01:20] work Houston we have a big problem Brian
[01:23] Johnson just released a new video about
[01:25] calculating your speed of Aging for free
[01:29] so the video looks looks like this and
[01:31] there are six markers that you can do at
[01:34] home for free like how many push-up reps
[01:36] can you do um and and some of many other
[01:39] stuff and of course that gives me tons
[01:41] of app ideas so what I did is I Clon my
[01:44] Bott plates and I ask my AI editor a
[01:47] cursor to build an entire app for me I
[01:50] didn't write a single line of code and
[01:52] this is what I came up with so that's uh
[01:54] this is this is pretty made with AI and
[01:57] those basically more like forms where
[01:58] you enter number push-ups one leg stand
[02:01] U and few of other metrics and then you
[02:03] can calculate your score and in the end
[02:05] it will give you a result on what's your
[02:07] biological age this is extremely
[02:09] lowlevel product for the moment I have
[02:11] tons of ideas like adding leaderboards
[02:14] uh making it verified with uh actually
[02:17] uploading photos connecting your Twitter
[02:19] Google accounts so it could be like a
[02:21] leaderboard with profile pictures for uh
[02:23] like real people I also bought a new
[02:25] domain name bio a.ge for Bio AG this
[02:29] this is a really early stage but there's
[02:31] something going on with health at the
[02:33] moment artificial intelligence is
[02:35] shaping the medical industry and if you
[02:37] are a maker it's a big wave to jump in
[02:40] because things are going to happen in
[02:42] many ways stepping into Healthcare right
[02:45] now is like stepping into that future
[02:47] world the next 10 years are going to be
[02:48] crazy with a mix of AI an AI tool they
[02:51] trained on medical data plus the health
[02:53] wave there tons of things to build and I
[02:56] really really really really recommend
[02:57] you to just jump in just build whatever
[03:00] you have in mind don't spend too much
[03:02] time on it just ship your idea out there
[03:04] I hope the app is ready when this video
[03:06] comes out if that's the case there will
[03:07] be a link in the description and my goal
[03:09] is to get Brian Johnson to see this app
[03:12] and retweet it let's go
[03:18] [Music]
[03:32] all right so something I I believe too
[03:35] is that if you want something to work
[03:37] out on the internet you get to put on
[03:39] the energy you have to leave through it
[03:41] in my case I'm really into mental health
[03:43] and physical health and I'm going to
[03:45] build tons of health related startups
[03:48] but at the same time I try to have a
[03:50] life that is perfectly healthy so that
[03:52] means better food better sleep more
[03:54] workouts that means I learn things that
[03:56] means I discover problems and that feeds
[03:58] my inspiration to build startups and
[04:01] because those startup ideas are based on
[04:03] real fact the life I live then I am
[04:06] almost guaranteed that at some point
[04:08] some of those startup will also appeal
[04:10] to some other people time for
[04:12] [Music]
[04:19] workout and if you don't know what is
[04:21] your thing then try new stuff travel
[04:23] abroad meet some new group of people
[04:25] like go to meetups where people have
[04:26] different skills than yours try
[04:27] something new get out of the comfort
[04:29] zone
[04:32] [Music]
[04:36] now time to C I just got this from
[04:40] Google it's a badge that says I got
[04:42] 10,000 visitors on one of my websites in
[04:45] the past 30 days this website actually
[04:47] was my first ever indie project and even
[04:51] though it's not sexy it's like a Bas
[04:53] simple movie recommendation app this
[04:56] project gave me this batch from Google
[04:58] but it also grew my follow on Twitter
[05:00] gave me tons of new startup ideas and it
[05:03] gave me the confidence I needed to get
[05:05] started so do more not sexy project any
[05:08] kind of project just shap something and
[05:10] maybe years down the road you'll get a
[05:12] website with 300 daily visitors and you
[05:15] can run ads and he could pay for your
[05:17] rent I'm reading the inevitable
[05:20] inevitable by Kevin KY the guy who
[05:24] created the magazine wired and also the
[05:26] author of a book one of my actually top
[05:28] three favorite books ever
[05:30] called excellent advice of wisdom I wish
[05:33] I knew earlier or something along those
[05:35] lines the book itself is is just a
[05:37] masterpiece it's a collection basically
[05:39] of like mini tweets that each of them is
[05:41] a life lesson and uh this one the
[05:44] inevitable is about predictions that he
[05:46] makes about where Tech and AI will drive
[05:49] the world like 12 prediction on how the
[05:51] world is going to change I'm
[05:53] 36% completed with this book and I
[05:56] already love it full rainy season in b
[06:01] meanwhile delicious meal prepar
[06:04] [Music]
[06:13] by it's 7:30 a.m. and I just bought
[06:17] another domain two days two domain
[06:23] names now that I am back in my office in
[06:25] Bali I'm super super happy to add this
[06:29] into my room office whatever this is
[06:32] because it's here in this room that this
[06:34] was made possible and actually same as
[06:37] this little thing here is because at
[06:38] some point I decided to sit in this room
[06:41] and just spend most of my time building
[06:43] stuff that those two things happen so
[06:46] keep
[06:48] shipping I just set up these recovery
[06:52] emails so this is being sent to people
[06:55] who actually uh complete a part of the
[06:58] checkout they leave their email address
[07:00] but they don't complete the payment
[07:01] could be because the credit card failed
[07:03] it could be because they changed their
[07:05] mind at the last minute so what I'm
[07:06] doing here in the stripe webbook event
[07:09] called checkout. session. expired I'm
[07:11] checking if the person left an email
[07:13] otherwise I can't email them and if the
[07:16] person is not already a customer of mine
[07:18] and if that's the case then I send them
[07:20] a very simple email that says hey I
[07:22] noticed you were checking out cut fast
[07:24] yesterday anything I can help you with
[07:26] and then a link to get back to my
[07:28] landing page just in case they forgot or
[07:31] in case something go wrong here what I'm
[07:32] doing with this is I'm opening the
[07:33] discussion so I'm trying to understand
[07:35] why they didn't purchase even though
[07:37] they click the button and left their
[07:38] emails and I just hope this will give me
[07:40] some uh better uh feedback so I know
[07:42] maybe how to tweak the landing page to
[07:44] convert more visitors and if you want
[07:47] the code there is a link to one of my
[07:48] tweets below this video where you can
[07:50] just copy past the code and use it in
[07:52] your own project
[07:53] [Music]
[08:16] okay so I just set up YouTube ads for my
[08:20] course code fast I am very bad at ads
[08:24] really really bad but I want to give it
[08:25] a try because we never know uh sometimes
[08:27] you try stuff and it works and sometimes
[08:29] it doesn't but uh just curious about
[08:31] this one still waiting for Google to
[08:32] approve the ad and um let's see how it
[08:34] goes okay so quick update on Coach fast
[08:37] the course I launched about a month and
[08:38] a half ago uh you can see the revenue uh
[08:41] of course at the launch was going up
[08:42] like crazy and then now it's slowing
[08:44] down and what I'm trying to do uh for
[08:47] this first quarter of the year is to try
[08:49] to find a recurring marketing channel
[08:51] and since it's a course is pretty large
[08:53] I'm targeting like a very wide audience
[08:55] so I'm trying to run ads to this website
[08:58] so I created this sort of uh as here so
[09:01] you want to learn a code to build your
[09:02] own online business go to cast.now
[09:06] enroll for the course learn the basics
[09:09] and everything you need to build an
[09:10] online business ready to get customers
[09:12] so my video editor pH a model in Bell to
[09:15] help me read the script and since I
[09:17] absolutely suck at making a marketing
[09:20] scripts I asked my friend Nico who is
[09:22] really good at marketing to help me with
[09:23] that and then for the format I got
[09:25] inspired by clo which is a very famous
[09:28] software engineer on you YouTube I
[09:29] remember 3 four years ago I was watching
[09:31] a bunch of his videos then I saw a
[09:33] masterpiece of an ad and I use his
[09:35] format to make my own ad and I just
[09:37] started running this uh YouTube video on
[09:40] Google ads so it's only showing on
[09:41] YouTube at the moment I just started
[09:43] spending money so I have two campaigns
[09:45] one uh that is a wide campaign so it
[09:48] targets people who are somehow in the
[09:51] software engineer coding industry so
[09:53] people who visit websites like code
[09:55] academy or who watch a YouTube like a
[09:58] programming YouTube YouTu channels it
[10:00] looks like it's getting a bunch of
[10:01] clicks for the amount spent about $30
[10:04] per day uh but so far no conversion so I
[10:06] don't know if I'm doing something wrong
[10:07] with my code or if it's just not
[10:09] converging at the moment and I set up
[10:10] another campaign where it's more like
[10:12] retargeting people who visited the
[10:14] websites uh usually this is what
[10:15] marketer calls that like a warm audience
[10:18] so people who are more likely to buy
[10:20] your product because they already know
[10:21] what you have to sell and uh Google is
[10:23] going to show this ad to those people
[10:24] where it gets way less click but somehow
[10:27] it converted already uh I think there
[10:28] was one purchase which makes the
[10:30] campaign profitable making ads is really
[10:33] not my uh cup of tea but I feel like if
[10:36] I manage to make it click it could be
[10:38] one way to make sure that the business
[10:40] somehow is steady and then I can focus
[10:43] on for instance um making more lessons
[10:45] adding more things for students so my
[10:47] time and mind doesn't have to be on the
[10:49] marketing side of things and of course
[10:50] if I get good results I'll report that
[10:52] in those videos I can't not put this on
[10:55] the record this should be remembered 15
[10:58] ingredients
[11:00] vegetables and love that's the recipe
[11:03] [Music]
[11:11] important is there wave sir yeah
[11:13] tomorrow is going to be firing W hello
[11:16] little
[11:17] babies hello hello this is uh the place
[11:22] here where we came with tons of ideas
[11:24] for the Vlogs tons of startup ideas
[11:27] walking man it's a such a creativity
[11:30] hack that's true okay so we are deciding
[11:32] where we go this year because we're
[11:34] going to leave Bal and we're going to
[11:35] travel all over the world to meet you
[11:38] we're going to host a Meetup we're going
[11:39] to host Meetup countri first is New
[11:41] Zealand then we're going to go to Japan
[11:44] Japan oh we're going to do a meet up in
[11:46] B first then the plan is right now we go
[11:49] India first then we go back to Europe we
[11:51] were thinking of doing like Norway
[11:53] Finland Sweden North countries just for
[11:56] the peacefulness and quietness and then
[11:58] maybe the US go we know that there are
[12:00] many people living in the North America
[12:03] like Canada us so we're excited to meet
[12:06] you there as well that's very true and
[12:09] if you can maybe St or Central America
[12:12] because it has been my you know dream to
[12:15] go back there and we go back to France
[12:17] for next Christmas the issue here is
[12:19] trying to stay productive while
[12:21] traveling so I still make apps we still
[12:23] make those Vlogs we still make more
[12:24] videos on YouTube right for the news
[12:26] later make some tweets while trying to
[12:28] enjoy traveling this is the really hard
[12:30] part but uh yeah let's see it now it's
[12:32] put on the camera we'll see how that
[12:34] year
[12:39] goes it's so empty there is no one
[12:43] here except this person good wave
[12:47] tomorrow yeah this is where I'm surfing
[12:49] yeah I'm excited I cannot wait for
[12:51] tomorrow
[12:53] wow look at this man such a de Focus
[12:57] mode we're working on I I am designing
[13:01] this was one of the most requested
[13:02] feature so now you can watch your
[13:05] website analytics for specific like a
[13:07] custom date range so you have this
[13:09] option where you can choose to watch for
[13:12] custom and then you have this date biger
[13:14] yeah that's pretty much it so I'm
[13:15] pushing this today I guess I spend too
[13:17] much time on this but I freaking love it
[13:19] I like all the little animations where
[13:21] the mouse cursor moves and even this you
[13:23] know like this little transition when
[13:24] you move the cursor and then it's just
[13:26] super exciting actually to make this
[13:28] kind of stuff I didn't really like at
[13:29] the beginning then you realize design is
[13:32] absolutely not about creativity but more
[13:34] like principles it's a mix of rules and
[13:36] coping what's working adding your own
[13:38] signature on top of it and then a little
[13:40] bit of obsession no coffee and straight
[13:44] wake up code code code
[13:47] [Music]
[13:49] ah quick update on my web analytics
[13:52] software data fast so let's look first
[13:54] at the revenue on stripe now I start to
[13:56] see daily payments which make me super
[13:58] happy like little uh sales notifications
[14:00] uh here we're looking at the last what 3
[14:03] weeks or so of data uh so we can see the
[14:05] monthly recuring revenue is at 925 which
[14:07] is getting close to $11,000 per month
[14:10] that makes me super happy it's overall
[14:11] going up constantly and the number of
[14:14] active subscribers as well and the
[14:16] subscriber turn rate is now around 14% I
[14:19] guess which is uh I I think I can leave
[14:21] up with it I added new feature this uh
[14:23] option here will let users choose uh
[14:26] when they want to query their data and I
[14:29] also spend a little too much time
[14:30] designing this uh loading screen where
[14:33] uh when people change the type of
[14:35] Journey they want to see they want to
[14:37] know what their customers are doing on
[14:38] their sites they're going to see like a
[14:40] little spinner like a loading screen
[14:42] here so they have something to look at
[14:43] and they know it's loading this is not
[14:46] necessarily useful but this just made me
[14:49] so happy I also created a documentation
[14:51] for data fast to help people set up
[14:53] their accounts so this is kind of like a
[14:55] Blog SL documentation this is using a
[14:58] mark down down template right here where
[15:00] I just have to write English and a
[15:02] couple of markdowns and it outputs a
[15:05] nice looking documentation and of course
[15:07] I had to design every little uh things
[15:09] from scratch but now that it's designed
[15:11] I don't do anything I just make
[15:13] beautiful articles uh very simply oh and
[15:15] one last thing I am not sure I mentioned
[15:17] this in the this YouTube video I set up
[15:19] server side tracking which means that
[15:21] now people using data fast and tracking
[15:23] payments with it can link visitors and
[15:26] customers data with almost 100% accuracy
[15:29] so that they know exactly where the
[15:30] money is coming from the goal with this
[15:32] software is to grade to a million dollar
[15:34] in valuation so that's about 20 to
[15:36] $225,000 in monthly recuring Revenue
[15:38] we're far from there and there are still
[15:40] a lot of things to build but uh it's
[15:42] going up so this is a positive
[15:44] [Music]
[15:52] thing are you ready for the cold
[15:55] PL no more
[15:57] Russian what is this head actually I
[15:59] really don't know I hope our Russian
[16:01] friends can tell us what is this okay
[16:03] please leave in the comment what is this

[17:35] 800k we have cross $1 million with ship
[17:39] Fest already wow how many months 18 18
[17:46] months this this is the freaking
[17:50] date we made it what's very crazy to me
[17:53] is we were sitting in the exact place 18
[17:56] months ago we made almost 0 back then
[18:00] yeah and I remember I had this little
[18:01] weekend project that I created for
[18:04] myself and I was like ah I'm going to
[18:05] try to launch it and right here it was
[18:07] 5:00 p.m. I was about to go skate before
[18:09] it's dark and I put the computer and I
[18:12] told you I launched something on product
[18:13] hunt I'll be back in 2 hours we're lucky
[18:16] if we make
[18:17] $300 I had no idea any of this would
[18:19] happen oh yeah cuz back then we didn't
[18:22] have any result so if you can have like
[18:25] one or three sale it was still success
[18:28] you know and then one year and a half
[18:30] later boom a freaking million dollar
[18:34] with a weekend project this is a website
[18:36] the launch day was crazy CU we earn like
[18:39] $4,000 a day yeah about three 3.5 but
[18:43] still like for us like $1,000 was a
[18:46] monthly salary and then yeah we kept
[18:49] having notification and we were in Hong
[18:51] Kong we kept up what is happening is it
[18:53] real like yeah it's was like did you
[18:55] make money we refresh like wow we just
[18:57] drank coffee more Starbucks Cooke wow we
[19:00] made more money in 24 hours than we
[19:04] would in 6 month crazy okay so this
[19:07] weekend project made a million dollar
[19:10] after 18 months and 85% of that is pure
[19:14] profit these are the stripe dashboard so
[19:17] that's the first one back in 2023 and I
[19:19] then I opened a new business and this is
[19:21] the new one so I wanted to tell you a
[19:23] little story about finding
[19:25] million-dollar startup ideas I started
[19:27] the entrepreneurship in 20 2016 back
[19:30] then I had a Grand Vision like a big
[19:32] dream I was working 12 hours a day and I
[19:34] believe that IDs were Priceless and 4
[19:37] years later I made around $70,000 with
[19:40] one of my set which let me pay the bills
[19:43] which is technically not bad I was able
[19:45] to leave anywhere with a computer but
[19:47] with all the sacrifices I made it was
[19:49] clearly not worth it and that's why I
[19:51] had a burnout in 2020 and this is the
[19:54] actual SAS I created I was working with
[19:57] physical businesses Escape rooms and in
[19:59] then in 2020 Co killed my set it went
[20:01] literally from about $4,000 in monthly
[20:04] recurring Revenue to zero in a single
[20:07] month and after that I had almost no
[20:09] savings no ideas to start next and not
[20:11] even motivation to start again so I
[20:14] started to look for a job and I work as
[20:16] a software engineer for someone that you
[20:18] might know tylerz and they offered me a
[20:20] salary that was way beyond what I ever
[20:22] thought I would earn so obviously I
[20:24] accepted and I worked for them for 9
[20:26] months but of course there was this it
[20:28] ins inside of me this Freedom itch that
[20:30] keeps scratching back and called me back
[20:32] and so in November 2021 I started
[20:34] entrepreneurship again and this time I
[20:36] had a different set of rules I dit all
[20:39] the ambitious and the Big Dreams that I
[20:41] had before and instead I would work on
[20:43] tiny little project that I could launch
[20:45] on a weekend I would share everything
[20:46] publicly on Twitter and then I would
[20:48] just launch move build while making
[20:51] sleep my number one priority and back
[20:53] then my goal was to create something
[20:55] that I can control and the goal was to
[20:57] create a massive portfolio of websites
[21:00] sometimes those websites are not even
[21:01] monetized like this one here where you
[21:03] can vote for your favorite quote from
[21:04] Naval ravikant about this websit where
[21:06] you can like visualize how much you can
[21:09] achieve in one year with tiny habits I
[21:11] build this directory of gamification
[21:14] apps there was no goal really it was
[21:16] just purely I want to build this
[21:18] portfolio of websites and 12 months
[21:20] later I had made around $10,000 and grow
[21:24] a little audience of 5,000 people on
[21:26] Twitter which is definitely good but
[21:28] clearly knowing that I was working all
[21:30] day and then I was already in the game
[21:32] for 5 years this is also not crazy but
[21:35] it doesn't matter because I was actually
[21:37] having tons of fun and since my
[21:39] obsession was to build a portfolio
[21:41] massive portfolio a website I wanted to
[21:43] create a little tool for myself so that
[21:45] I can make those websites faster so I
[21:47] created this tool called ship fast and
[21:49] launched it on the last day of August
[21:51] 2023 2 days later it made
[21:55] $6,000 what I would typically earn in 6
[21:57] months and now day 18 months later it
[22:00] made a million dollar this is just
[22:04] absolutely crazy because in my journey
[22:07] it was just yet another website with uh
[22:09] no marketing strategies no big plans
[22:12] nothing just a little tool I need for
[22:14] myself but this experience took me one
[22:16] thing that is crucial startup ideas are
[22:18] not found they are crafted from your own
[22:21] experience so instead of waiting for uh
[22:24] something a good idea to come and strike
[22:26] you instead here is what you can do [ __ ]
[22:28] around and find out build something
[22:31] build it fast share it to the world
[22:33] whether it's on Twitter Youtube or
[22:34] Instagram repeat the same process but
[22:36] this time build something different or
[22:38] share it in a different way and then
[22:39] repeat over and over and over and then
[22:42] in all the noise you create when it's
[22:44] time some luck something some signal
[22:46] will find you so if you're a developer
[22:48] like me who loves to create stuff this
[22:50] is your advantage ship stuff no matter
[22:53] the outcome no matter if you get lots of
[22:55] users no matter if it makes some money
[22:57] just ship it for the sake of it ship it
[22:59] to create the noise so that luck can
[23:01] find you later keep
[23:08] shipping I want to confess
[23:11] something I bought a new domain
[23:14] name damn it
