[00:00] boom and we're live thanks for doing
[00:01] this man I appreciate it Hey Joe thanks
[00:04] for having me I was looking forward to
[00:05] this podcast
[00:06] do you ever do yoga oh well you're going
[00:09] straight to the point uh but yeah I used
[00:12] to feel very stiff in my body so I pick
[00:14] up yoga to feel more flexible how did
[00:16] you become that guy uh you mean the type
[00:18] of guy who gets things done yeah oh yeah
[00:21] but uh I just started stretching one
[00:23] minute per day until it become a habit
[00:25] wow and now I can easily touch my toes
[00:27] probably a [ __ ] ballerina at this
[00:28] point yeah do you want me to show you a
[00:31] simple exercise so you can do it too
[00:33] yeah um okay so sit straight open your
[00:37] arms and breathe with your nose
[00:40] now close your eyes and visualize
[00:42] yourself touching your toes yes it's
[00:45] painful to imagine it but it feels good
[00:47] right it's fuel for me I mean I I love
[00:50] that [ __ ] I live off of it
[00:52] so what do you do now yeah so I just
[00:55] created an app called visualize habits
[00:57] it's a calculator to show you how much
[00:58] you can achieve with tiny habits so
[01:00] let's say uh you start to read 15
[01:02] minutes per day in 2023 but by the end
[01:05] of the year you would have read 12 books
[01:08] man maybe Joe you can tell your audience
[01:12] about it no go after it you
[01:15] [ __ ] come on
[01:18] that doesn't fire people
