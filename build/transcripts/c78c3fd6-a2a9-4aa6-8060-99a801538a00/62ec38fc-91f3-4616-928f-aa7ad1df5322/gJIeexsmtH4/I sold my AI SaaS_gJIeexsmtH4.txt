[00:00] in 2023 I built a landing page generator
[00:02] using gp4 and stable diffusion within a
[00:05] few month after launching I made $15,000
[00:08] in Revenue but for some reason I
[00:09] couldn't grow it so I ended up sending
[00:11] the product for
[00:12] $35,000 in this video I'm going to break
[00:15] down how I got the IDE how I built the
[00:17] first version of the product and got the
[00:18] first customers and how and why I ended
[00:20] up selling it in March 2023 AI is so big
[00:24] and everybody is talking about AI tools
[00:26] chpg and all those AI services that I
[00:28] decide to go all in and build bu my own
[00:30] AI tools as well as a solo developer
[00:32] who's built about 20 websites in the
[00:34] past 2 years I thought it would be
[00:35] really cool if we could just input text
[00:37] and get a learing page or many websites
[00:39] generated for like something like a
[00:41] portfolio a yoga studio um a software
[00:44] learing page and so I start to build and
[00:48] the product was extremely simple um
[00:50] customers would have to fill a form uh
[00:53] describing the tone of the voice they
[00:55] want to be using uh the colors they
[00:57] would like to choose for the landing
[00:58] page uh describe their product describe
[01:00] their customers and choose among one of
[01:02] those three packages so for $19 they
[01:04] would get an entire Ling page generated
[01:07] and they will get more variation more
[01:09] illustrations more images uh with bigger
[01:12] packages here's a demo of a ling page
[01:14] that's been generated with my first
[01:16] version of the product um you can see
[01:19] here it's like a website uh the
[01:22] components are those that I built myself
[01:25] and they are basically empty so you
[01:26] would have this pressing section that I
[01:28] built that was empty and then when the
[01:30] customer would pay I would make a
[01:31] request to the gp4 API to fill in uh
[01:35] information uh by titles and
[01:37] descriptions based on the customer input
[01:39] it will also create um not always really
[01:42] good images uh but that would be
[01:44] relevant to the to the headlines um it
[01:47] would also try to match the colors of uh
[01:49] the websites based on on the image and
[01:53] the customer would be able to update a
[01:56] few things here so if they want to
[01:57] change the theme for instance they can
[01:59] go with whatever they want from the
[02:00] theme and if they're happy with it they
[02:02] can download the code HTML code or just
[02:05] share the code with their team
[02:08] members um it was really minimal the
[02:10] resit were not incredible but it was
[02:12] working and it was pretty impressive to
[02:13] be able to make these with just a few um
[02:16] inputs and so I decided to launch on
[02:19] product tense and the product ended up
[02:20] being uh ranking third of the day which
[02:22] I was really happy with uh back then I
[02:24] was building in public on Twitter so
[02:26] sharing my progress there and I already
[02:28] had um probably 15,000 followers which
[02:32] helped me boost the product hunt launch
[02:35] I also launched on Hacker News uh didn't
[02:38] get much traffic but little push and uh
[02:41] nice comments surprisingly from Hacker
[02:43] News so I was pretty satisfied with it
[02:45] as well within about 2 month the product
[02:49] had made about â‚¬7,000 which is roughly
[02:52] $8,000 I was pretty satisfied with it
[02:55] but then I realized the name of my
[02:57] startup was the same as a bigger soft
[02:59] software company so I had to Rebrand the
[03:02] entire website and so I rebranded
[03:04] lending AI into Mech lending I got rid
[03:07] of the AI wordings so that anyone who
[03:10] wants to make a ling page but is not
[03:11] familiar with artificial intelligence
[03:13] would still understand the product uh un
[03:15] likee before it would be simpler no form
[03:17] just people type what they want to make
[03:19] the site I also added this little demo
[03:21] on the landing page that uh was quite I
[03:24] catchy to still show that you can input
[03:26] a text and get a website generated also
[03:29] added some of potential landing page uh
[03:31] that were actually made with the product
[03:34] and I bumped the price a little bit from
[03:36] 29 to from $19 to $29 per landing page
[03:40] the big difference lie in the user
[03:43] dashboard uh unlike before where you
[03:45] would get the lending page generated and
[03:46] not be able to do much with it now users
[03:48] would log in and be able to edit the
[03:50] entire landing page so that includes um
[03:53] changing the headlines changing the
[03:55] images by using either stock photo
[03:56] library um uploading your picture or
[03:58] generating AI photos um adding removing
[04:02] buttons adding sections to the site
[04:05] changing the colors of the site just
[04:07] like before the themes um also the
[04:10] phones as well a bunch of things that
[04:12] could be done here um then people could
[04:15] preview the site and if they are happy
[04:18] with it they would get uh a link so that
[04:20] they will be able to share that with um
[04:23] anyone and start to bring traffic to the
[04:25] landing page and convert into whatever
[04:27] this is they wanted I also added
[04:29] Analytics
[04:30] uh per landing page so that people uh
[04:32] have a little clue of what's going on
[04:33] there the new product was more polished
[04:35] and I decided to launch it so I went
[04:38] back to my Twitter I shared uh this time
[04:40] a little video that explains how it
[04:41] works and I launched it on product tant
[04:44] I did not get the batch this time but I
[04:46] think uh people were used to what I
[04:48] shipped before so these got a bit less
[04:50] attention but I was getting really
[04:52] decent traffic um after the launch
[04:54] people started to reshare this on AI
[04:57] newsletter and it it got 10 to 15K
[05:01] visitors uh per month and I think within
[05:04] 3 months I had made almost 9,000 Us doll
[05:08] uh which was quite nice I'm living here
[05:10] in Bali and it would definitely pay more
[05:12] than the bills um although there were a
[05:16] little less conversions in terms of
[05:18] visitor to uh paid customers and I think
[05:21] it's because I entered the market of big
[05:24] landing page Builders so framer word
[05:27] WordPress um webflow would compete with
[05:30] I would compete with those uh big guys
[05:32] and as a solo prer with limited
[05:35] resources um it was really hard to
[05:37] commit users to pay for my uh entire
[05:40] website generator when they have framer
[05:43] as a competitor and from that moment I
[05:45] knew it was time to sell because I had
[05:47] no idea how to get it to the next level
[05:49] in October 2023 when I decided to sell
[05:51] the startup I abandoned it which means I
[05:54] would still do customer support but I
[05:55] would not add any feature or I would not
[05:57] do any marketing meanwhile I listed the
[06:00] startup on aire.com which is a uh small
[06:03] startup acquisition marketplace where
[06:05] you have a bunch of uh buyers that are
[06:06] willing to have a look at your product
[06:08] after listing the startup I got dozens
[06:10] of offer within one day I think and uh
[06:14] some of them were promising so I started
[06:15] to engage engage with the buyers and the
[06:18] process is always similar at least for
[06:20] micro startup like mine where you would
[06:22] have to sign um an agreements on which
[06:24] assets will be transferred um in my case
[06:26] it would be a domain name the code base
[06:28] the customer base the datab and all that
[06:31] and uh after a few days chatting with a
[06:33] buyer one of them decided to buy the
[06:35] startup and without even having any
[06:38] phone call the money lending in my bank
[06:40] account we agreed on $35,000 and after
[06:43] the cut I got 33.6k in my bank account
[06:46] which uh seems like crazy knowing that
[06:48] we never uh got each other on the phone
[06:51] um this is actually my third startup
[06:53] acquisition this year I sold two other
[06:55] mro startup and I wrote a little blog
[06:58] article about it if you want I'll leave
[07:00] a link in the description if that helps
[07:01] you um this is not a lifechanging amount
[07:05] of money but 35k plus 15K Revenue that's
[07:08] $50,000 which where I live here in valy
[07:11] would basically buy me two years of
[07:14] whatever this is I want to do so I would
[07:16] get two years of peacefulness retirement
[07:18] or two years of grinds if I want and
[07:20] this is exactly what I did after selling
[07:22] the startup I keep shipping more apps
[07:24] and now my small like really tiny
[07:27] internet businesses are making this
[07:29] month January 2024 50 $50,000 Us in
[07:33] Revenue zero employee and 90% profit and
[07:37] I couldn't have done it without having
[07:39] the clarity and the peace of mind that
[07:41] uh those uh startup sell gave me last
[07:43] year so I really recommend you to um
[07:45] shop daily find a product a problem that
[07:48] you have that you want to solve ship a
[07:50] very small tiny version of the the
[07:53] product and launch it and see where that
[07:55] goes cuz you might U end up getting some
[07:57] sales and up be able to to sell it and
[08:00] buy a few uh years of retirement or
[08:02] Grant cheers
