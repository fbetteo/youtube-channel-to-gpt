[00:05] [Music]
[00:09] this is a crazy
[00:11] [Music]
[00:22] story today is day 1,49 building
[00:25] startups in public and uh since I made
[00:28] my first tweet on almost 3 years ago I
[00:31] have built 24 websites and made a
[00:34] million dollar and started this YouTube
[00:36] series where I share everything I do so
[00:38] you don't make the same mistakes as me
[00:40] so here is my solo prary diary for
[00:47] 2024 this is a habit tracker I built two
[00:50] years ago and sold it a year ago for
[00:52] $10,000 because I was running out of
[00:54] money and just 2 weeks ago I got it back
[00:57] for free this is a crazy story but
[01:00] before I tell you what happened let me
[01:01] show you why this habit tracker is
[01:03] special so the app will give you daily
[01:05] missions where for instance it tells me
[01:08] that I have to read today then once you
[01:10] have completed your reading habit you
[01:12] can finish the quest and then you will
[01:14] get some rewards like experience points
[01:16] and gems and then you have a little
[01:19] garden where you can grow flowers with
[01:21] the gems you just earned you can plant
[01:24] any sorts of flowers and you can grow
[01:25] them as you're consistent with your
[01:27] habits and on top of that there is a
[01:29] social part where you can play against
[01:32] or with your friends see how consistent
[01:34] they are see their activity Etc I built
[01:37] this app 2 years ago it was my first
[01:39] project with a pay wall at first it was
[01:42] just a simple web application and I
[01:44] launched it with this video boom and
[01:46] we're live thanks for doing this man I
[01:48] appreciate it Hey Joe thanks for having
[01:50] me I was looking forward to this podcast
[01:52] and that video
[01:54] [Music]
[02:00] people enjoy those videos that's why I
[02:02] grow a little following on Twitter and
[02:04] one of the most requested feature was
[02:06] Mark we need a mobile apps but the thing
[02:09] is I have no clue how to build mobile
[02:11] application I am a web developer after
[02:13] all so I reached out to my friend Martin
[02:16] and he showed me this new thing called
[02:17] capacitor it's basically like a web view
[02:20] that lets you input any HTML and CSS
[02:23] files inside and ship it as an iOS and
[02:26] an Android app and from zero to having
[02:28] an app published on the App Store and
[02:30] Android store without learning anything
[02:33] it took 14 days it was around January
[02:36] 2023 back then the app was making a
[02:39] couple $100 a month and it wasn't enough
[02:42] to pay my bills I was running out of
[02:44] money and in August 20123 someone made
[02:47] me an
[02:48] [Applause]
[02:50] offer Ron offered to buy habits Garden
[02:53] for
[02:55] $110,000 that was enough money to pay my
[02:57] bill so I accepted and I sold my little
[03:01] baby I announced the acquisition on
[03:03] Twitter I was pretty happy and reliev
[03:06] for the money but I was also a little
[03:07] bit sad because well that was that was
[03:09] the the product that I've been working
[03:10] on for the past 6 months so I was also a
[03:13] little sad it was a year ago and fast
[03:16] forward to a couple weeks ago I was
[03:18] curious about how the new buyer is doing
[03:20] with a new startup so I just sent an
[03:22] email asking how is it going with the
[03:26] startup I had zero expectation from this
[03:30] email just genuine curiosity and the
[03:32] buyer replied we don't have the
[03:34] bandwidth to work on habits Garden we
[03:36] can give it back to you for free man are
[03:38] you kidding me I got my habit tracker
[03:42] back my little baby I was so excited and
[03:45] now that I'm not running out of money
[03:47] like before I can plan and carefully
[03:49] make my moves so I'm trying three things
[03:51] the first one is that I am shipping new
[03:53] features last week I shipped a new
[03:56] flower for the habits Garden the Hein
[04:01] that unlocks randomly when you complete
[04:03] quests and as always with capacitor it
[04:06] takes just a day or something to for the
[04:09] app to be approved on the app stores and
[04:11] my friend Martin is still here to help
[04:13] me when I'm stuck with the app storees
[04:15] release second I'm trying a new pricing
[04:18] it used to be a monthly or a yearly
[04:20] subscription now I'm trying a $5 a month
[04:23] subscription or a $50 lifetime deal you
[04:26] pay once you access forever the pay wall
[04:28] looks like like this this and now people
[04:30] have the option between a monthly or a
[04:33] lifetime deal payment and so far there
[04:36] has been a couple of customers and all
[04:38] of them chose to go with a lifetime deal
[04:41] even though it's 10 times more expensive
[04:43] I'm making a video about pricing for
[04:45] software and apps and mistakes I made in
[04:48] the past that kept my startups from
[04:49] making money and I'm going to release
[04:51] that on my channel in a couple of weeks
[04:53] you can subscribe to make sure you don't
[04:54] miss out and finally number three I am
[04:56] testing user generated content in
[04:59] Instagram reals Tik toks shorts I think
[05:01] this is where the audience for the Habit
[05:03] tracker is and since I am a boring 30
[05:06] years old adult I don't watch any of
[05:08] those short form videos I asked my good
[05:10] friend Jack freaks if he can help with
[05:12] this and so he's making content all by
[05:15] himself one short form video per day and
[05:18] within 7 days he had a viral Banger this
[05:22] is the Instagram account he created it
[05:25] was Zero followers a couple days ago and
[05:28] it's all because Jack has been super
[05:29] super consistent and thanks to that he
[05:32] got the V the first viral Banger 3
[05:35] million views for a new Instagram
[05:38] account that brought a hundred of users
[05:40] to Habit garden and it's absolutely
[05:43] amazing make sure to follow this guy
[05:46] Jack freaks on Twitter he knows what
[05:48] he's doing he's doing the exact same
[05:49] thing for one of his mobile app and
[05:51] that's how he's getting thousands and
[05:52] thousands of users and I'm I'm tired of
[05:56] sitting all day long feels much better
[05:59] there's a a good friend of mine in Bal
[06:00] who told me to visit this place in the
[06:02] north part of Bal called munduk so my
[06:05] wife and I took a three days trip there
[06:07] I brought my uh my computer and uh we
[06:10] went to that beautiful Villa and it was
[06:13] absolutely amazing we would work on the
[06:15] daytime and unlike here where I live in
[06:18] the south part of belly where it's super
[06:20] hot outside so I'm mostly indoor with
[06:23] that AC thing all the time otherwise I'm
[06:25] sweaty everywhere and uh the brain is
[06:27] not working in munduk the the weather is
[06:30] much more chill so you can actually work
[06:32] outside and at the same time my wife and
[06:33] I would do our daily morning workout
[06:36] cook a little bit travel a little bit
[06:38] and enjoy a good time and then I
[06:40] received a text message from someone I
[06:41] admire Peter Lao asked me if I was in
[06:44] Singapore and uh I was done in Singapore
[06:47] but of course I bought a ticket to
[06:49] Singapore the man is giving a conference
[06:51] at the network state in Singapore and it
[06:53] was an opportunity for me to meet him
[06:55] for the first time so we flew there
[06:57] right away with my wife brought the
[06:59] computer put on some hours of work in
[07:01] the plane and attended to the conference
[07:04] the conference is called the network
[07:05] States if you haven't heard of it it's
[07:07] by the guy named Balaji um and I was
[07:09] actually very impressed by what they're
[07:11] doing they are building an entire
[07:12] ecosystem for new types of society so
[07:16] digital Nomad with their computers can
[07:18] go there I think it's $11,000 a month
[07:20] for a room with roommates or $2,000 a
[07:23] month for your own room it's built on an
[07:26] island in between Singapore and Malaysia
[07:28] they provide good food they provide
[07:30] co-working space with AC they provide a
[07:33] gym and a place to be healthy like
[07:34] literally a new kind of school and I was
[07:37] hooked the conference was great I got to
[07:39] meet some of you out there not through
[07:41] the camera but like for real and by the
[07:43] end of the conference I got to meet
[07:45] Peter levels the guy is amazing he's
[07:47] just a guy with with one computer and he
[07:51] makes at the moment
[07:54] $42,000 a month solo developer this is
[07:58] absolutely lutely insane the guy has
[08:01] given me the inspiration I needed to get
[08:03] started and it's still inspiring me like
[08:05] crazy he's super humble super kind we
[08:08] had fun with him his wife and his
[08:10] friends and he just made me more pumped
[08:12] to keep shipping startups and at the
[08:14] same time he invited me to the speakers
[08:16] dinner where I get a chance to meet
[08:18] another of my hero Brian Johnson he's
[08:21] the guy that now you see everywhere that
[08:23] talks about diet and sleep he is an
[08:26] amazing person really thanks to him I
[08:28] got to prioritize My Health Sleep diet
[08:31] and I feel so much better in my body so
[08:33] much more creative so much more
[08:35] efficient and seeing him in real after
[08:37] watching all of his videos it was just
[08:40] just just crazy just crazy the guy is
[08:42] exactly like he is in his videos he
[08:44] looks young and explosive and it was it
[08:47] was just so it was just so good and
[08:49] since my wife and I were in Singapore we
[08:51] also enjoy doing a little bit of City
[08:53] things uh man it's if you have never
[08:55] been to Singapore it's it's a crazy City
[08:58] in 20 minutes you go from the airport to
[09:00] the city center there's no traffic jam
[09:02] everything is super simple you get a
[09:05] Huber in like couple seconds you never
[09:07] use cash you never use credit card you
[09:09] pay with your phone everything is fast
[09:11] efficient it's a very very interesting
[09:13] City and we finished the trip with a
[09:15] little session of wake surfing in the
[09:18] middle of the city right on Monday
[09:20] morning a regular day as a solo prer and
[09:24] then we went back to belly because
[09:26] because I got some work to do if you
[09:28] follow me for a little while you
[09:30] probably know me for shipping startups
[09:32] in a couple days sometimes in a couple
[09:34] weeks but I have made a little exception
[09:37] I spent the last 3 month working on a
[09:39] new software and I'm proud to announce
[09:41] that this video is the official release
[09:43] of the beta let me show you how that
[09:46] works taam here is data FAS it's an
[09:49] analytic tool for startups fer to
[09:51] analyze traffic find out the best
[09:53] marketing channels and discover if a
[09:55] product is worth our time or not so this
[09:57] is my data fast dashboard with some of
[09:59] the website I built it gives me a quick
[10:01] overview of what happened in the past 24
[10:03] hours for each website I have access to
[10:06] simple web analytics so I can see the
[10:08] visitors per hours day uh whatever time
[10:11] frame this is that I want as well as a
[10:13] few metrics about user retention the
[10:15] bounce rate the session times the
[10:17] visitors on my site at the moment and I
[10:19] also see all the good web analytics data
[10:22] like which Pages do people visit where
[10:24] they're coming from the map of my
[10:26] visitors the brother they're using Etc
[10:29] now now if you have a startup that
[10:30] intends to make money on the internet
[10:32] this is where data fast shines you can
[10:34] connect with lemon squeezy or stripe and
[10:36] it's going to start showing Revenue data
[10:38] on your charts and he's going to try to
[10:40] connect the revenue and the traffic data
[10:42] in order to find out some growth inside
[10:44] for instance I can see in the referal
[10:47] tabs that um from Twitter I'm getting
[10:49] lots of visitors for this site but very
[10:51] low Rue the conv rate is
[10:54] .6% on the other side from these
[10:56] websites I'm getting 20 times more
[10:58] convers way less visitors but way more
[11:01] money and this and it's actually telling
[11:03] me that these seems to be the best
[11:04] marketing channels I have for this month
[11:06] so far then I have access to other
[11:08] interesting data I can see the map of my
[11:11] Revenue where is most of the money
[11:12] coming from is giving me some kpis about
[11:15] the revenue per visitors generated and
[11:18] what's the conversion rate now it's a
[11:20] very early version of the product but I
[11:21] I had to launch this because I spent 3
[11:23] month on these single products so I
[11:26] shipped this with a cheap pricing and
[11:29] there is even a free trial so you can
[11:30] try at no cost and I really hope you
[11:32] give me feedback so I can make the best
[11:34] Analytics tool for solo
[11:38] entrepreneurs so this here is what my
[11:42] portfolio of startup made in September
[11:45] 20124 around 85% of that is profit and
[11:49] the business is down by 7% well the fact
[11:53] that I'm focusing on data fast for the
[11:55] past 3 months probably does not help
[11:58] shift fast is still quite steady I'm
[12:00] building data fast actually to try to
[12:02] understand where is the revenue coming
[12:03] from for now what I see is mostly Word
[12:06] of Mouth affiliate a little bit of ads
[12:08] and that's it if you watch my previous
[12:10] video you will see that Indie page
[12:12] software made much more money than it
[12:14] used to I made a previous videos to
[12:16] explain how I managed to uplift the
[12:19] Basel line of this revenue and the rest
[12:21] is pretty steady most of those product
[12:24] are run on autopilot which means I'm
[12:26] here for customer support if needed or
[12:27] if there is a feature that is B being
[12:29] requested a lot that I'll ship something
[12:32] but for most of them they don't need my
[12:34] attention it's pretty much self served
[12:36] so there's nothing much to do here and
[12:39] finally I added a new source of income
[12:41] habits Garden my habit tracker which
[12:43] this month made
[12:46] $412 which is pretty good for a vitamin
[12:54] products 30,000 readers on my newsletter
[12:58] I started a year ago and it's been
[13:00] growing steady up and up and up it's a
[13:03] newsletter SL blog I share everything I
[13:05] learned as a solo entrepreneur in a
[13:07] written format for free if you want to
[13:09] check it out there's a link in the
[13:11] description I um I also finished this
[13:14] book by ran holiday it's a really good
[13:17] book it's made of like maybe 20 or 30
[13:20] chapters about stoicism and how to get
[13:23] things done literally and this is a
[13:25] really good match for entrepreneurs and
[13:27] when I'm not feeling like it sometimes
[13:29] sometimes I reread pages of it just to
[13:30] get motivated and right now I am reading
[13:33] this this book from Naval ravikant um
[13:36] I'm a big big fan of him actually I saw
[13:38] him at the network State Conference in
[13:40] Singapore and um I don't know just
[13:42] rereading the words of Naval is every
[13:45] every things he write is a little
[13:47] pleasure oh and uh this this thing
[13:49] happened GE domain name is ranked 57
[13:54] domain rating domain Authority 57 which
[13:57] is it's pretty high everybody call me
[13:59] crazy when I bought like those weird
[14:02] domain name that ends with
[14:04] unconventional tlds they said that it's
[14:07] hard to rank on Google you might get
[14:08] blacklisted or something and uh well
[14:10] it's it's my highest rated d right here
[14:14] so I think we should make exotic TLD
[14:16] cool again and um the domain name is
[14:18] super short I don't have to add a com
[14:21] it's like four letters in total so it's
[14:23] very simple and it creates a bunch of
[14:25] opportunities for a new brand name oh
[14:27] and and there is this as well started
[14:29] with something simple it's the best way
[14:30] to get more ideas to build a tiny
[14:32] audience to get feedback to learn there
[14:35] just so many things that just roll after
[14:37] that I went on these guys podcast and we
[14:41] talk about getting startups idea I sh
[14:43] everything I would do if I had to start
[14:45] over again it's jumping off startup
[14:47] ideas it was really interesting podcast
[14:49] I'll add a link in the description if
[14:51] you fancy and I also revived this is my
[14:55] very first startup this is how I made my
[14:58] first dollar on the the internet it was
[14:59] like back in 2018 so I revived the Ling
[15:03] page of that business just to remember
[15:06] where it's all started and how it it
[15:09] does not matter where you start because
[15:12] if clearly if you go to the site you
[15:13] will see that I had no idea what I was
[15:15] doing um the copy is bad the design is
[15:18] bad and this is not terrible because
[15:19] this is like two years of work but the
[15:21] first version of this was was actually
[15:23] very very terrible so yeah I just want
[15:25] so I just wanted to make sure the Ling
[15:26] page is up there just to remember that
[15:28] you can start from minus 100 and still
[15:31] improve from there and uh finally I am
[15:34] no longer using mail gun to send emails
[15:38] the reason behind that is I need to send
[15:39] marketing emails and I don't want to
[15:41] have two platforms one for transactional
[15:44] email and one for marketing emails so I
[15:46] went with recent it's a much simpler to
[15:50] use marketing platforms and they have a
[15:52] support for marketing emails and just
[15:54] with a few clicks you can send emails to
[15:56] your entire audience so you can
[15:58] broadcast new features about your
[16:00] product new update Etc it makes things
[16:02] much easier for developers like me who
[16:04] build startups in public that's it I
[16:07] hope you keep shipping and there is red
[16:11] ink everywhere that's the end of
[16:13] this video cheers
