[00:00] hey I'm markk I'm a soul entrepreneur
[00:02] living in belly with my Korean wife
[00:03] running seven tiny internet businesses
[00:06] and welcome to a day in my
[00:10] life I wake up naturally around 6:00
[00:13] a.m. when the Sun rises in
[00:17] Bali I don't have an alarm clock because
[00:20] I found sleep to be the most important
[00:22] factor on my happiness and overall
[00:25] stress I drink a big glass of water and
[00:28] I don't do anything else no work no
[00:31] computer before at least 9:00
[00:34] a.m. around 6:30 a.m. I pick a surfboard
[00:38] and head to the beach for a surf
[00:40] session do you want to come with me all
[00:42] right let's
[00:44] go I feed the dogs in the neighborhood
[00:47] so they're usually pretty
[00:48] welcoming I put my surfboard on the
[00:51] racks and head to the beach for a 5
[00:53] minutes scooter
[00:55] ride there are tons of monkeys at the
[00:58] beach but they normally don't care about
[01:00] me unless I have some
[01:03] food I surf in the South part of Bali
[01:07] where the water is very clear and I
[01:09] often see turtles and sometimes shark
[01:11] and
[01:14] menay I learned how to surf in Bali 5
[01:17] years ago and since that it has been
[01:19] part of my daily
[01:21] routine it gets me excited to get out of
[01:24] the bed and it also keeps me fit because
[01:27] I'm having so much fun and burning a
[01:28] bunch of calories and overall I feel
[01:30] like it's making me very
[01:32] happy I surf for 2 hours almost every
[01:36] day before going to
[01:37] work then I drive back home take a quick
[01:40] shower and make myself my favorite drink
[01:43] a cafe
[01:46] latte and then I start my favorite
[01:49] activity of the day
[01:50] reading I started reading 3 years ago
[01:53] and it has changed my life and then I
[01:56] prepare myself a little healthy
[01:58] breakfast I prep prepare the breakfast
[02:00] with a bunch of seeds and nuts then I
[02:03] add some plain yogurt a banana red
[02:06] berries like strawberry and also
[02:09] blueberries I usually eat breakfast
[02:11] alone and I start to think about the
[02:13] plan for the day my wife and I are
[02:16] renting a villa in Bal for a couple
[02:18] years and we have a guest room that I
[02:20] turned into an office where I have a
[02:22] desk a monitor and it's a good place for
[02:24] me to
[02:27] work I am a solo entrepreneur who can
[02:30] code so I built uh seven tiny internet
[02:33] businesses that are now making $55,000
[02:36] per month but I started 6 years ago and
[02:40] I almost lived like a cockroach for 5
[02:43] years making about $1,000 per month on a
[02:46] typical day I would add new features to
[02:49] some of my apps or I would create a new
[02:51] app from scratch I actually built some
[02:54] of those app Live on YouTube if you want
[02:56] to check the live stream part of my
[02:58] YouTube channel
[03:00] I want to stay solo so I don't have any
[03:02] employee so I handle every part of the
[03:05] business such as marketing so I check
[03:07] the analytics I make sure that the ads
[03:08] are running well I handle customer
[03:10] support and I also try to create some
[03:12] contents about everything that I learn
[03:14] and reshare it on Twitter and recently
[03:16] started this YouTube channel I also have
[03:19] a newsletter with about 12,000 readers
[03:22] where I share everything that I've
[03:23] [Music]
[03:27] learned a good chunk of my day is
[03:30] dedicated to Creation either uh content
[03:33] creation like on Twitter or which app to
[03:35] make next so I prioritize my sleep
[03:38] because I found out to be the best way
[03:40] to become creative and overall have the
[03:43] motivation to work and think properly I
[03:46] spend most of the day offline meaning I
[03:48] don't check Twitter or emails and I use
[03:51] that time to create my own things around
[03:54] 400 p.m. about 2 hours before my work
[03:57] day is about to end I go online on
[04:00] Twitter and I try to share everything
[04:02] that I've done and I've learned the sun
[04:05] goes down around 6:30 p.m. in belly and
[04:08] I use that time to close my computer and
[04:10] call it a day and the rest of the day is
[04:13] dedicated for cooling off and spending
[04:15] time with my wife we would typically
[04:17] order food on goek the equivalent of
[04:19] Yuber eats in Indonesia or we would go
[04:22] out to local
[04:23] restaurants we sometimes have serious
[04:26] conversations most most of the time we
[04:28] would end up teasing the first get
[04:31] 33 no
[04:33] more oh in the beginning we brush our
[04:35] teeth and we head to the playroom where
[04:38] uh it sounds a bit kinky this way but we
[04:41] would typically play PS4 or watch movies
[04:44] together around 9:00 p.m. I deem all the
[04:47] lights in the Villa so I barely see
[04:50] anything but that puts my body into
[04:52] sleep mode and I'm already uh kind of
[04:54] falling asleep before being into bed I
[04:57] always do 15 minutes of stretching
[04:59] before going a bed that helps me cool
[05:01] down and also my body gets stiff because
[05:03] of Surfing so that helps me become a bit
[05:06] flexible I take a quick shower and read
[05:09] a few pages of a book before falling
[05:12] asleep and restarting the exact same day
[05:16] tomorrow
