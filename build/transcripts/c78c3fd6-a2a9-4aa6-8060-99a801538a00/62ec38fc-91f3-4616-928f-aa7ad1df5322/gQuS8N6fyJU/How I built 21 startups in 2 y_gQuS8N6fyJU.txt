[00:01] when I got fired as a software engineer
[00:02] in November 2021 I started to build side
[00:05] project fast forward to today I launched
[00:07] 21 side project 10 of them became
[00:09] profitable startups and I'm now earning
[00:11] $55,000 a month as a solo entrepreneur
[00:14] in this video I am going to share how I
[00:16] get startup IDs and why building them
[00:18] really fast was the key to 5x my
[00:20] software engineer salary let's get into
[00:23] it all right so let's talk about how to
[00:26] find startup idas there are three ways
[00:28] to find them the first one is to solve
[00:30] your own problems let me illustrate this
[00:32] with an example those are all my 21 site
[00:35] projects and 10 of them are making money
[00:38] and one of the most common customer
[00:39] requests I receive is can I get a proper
[00:41] invoice I work with stripe to process
[00:45] all the payments that go through my
[00:46] startups and sometimes the receipt is
[00:48] not enough in customer uh mostly
[00:49] Europeans want to have an invoice that
[00:52] is properly formatted and as a business
[00:54] owner this is not a very fun part so I
[00:56] bu I'm building Zen voice it's a little
[00:59] uh wrapper around the stripe API that
[01:02] gives stripe business owners a special
[01:03] link that they can send to the customers
[01:05] where they input their email addresses
[01:07] and then they can retrieve all the
[01:08] purchases they've made with the business
[01:11] and then they can see the invoice they
[01:12] can uh edit some details to it add their
[01:14] name or their business detail like V8
[01:17] number all that kind of things and they
[01:18] can download their invoice and they're
[01:19] happy uh this is my way of solving my
[01:22] own problems and yours might be
[01:23] different so you might want to look at
[01:25] what's going on around in your life that
[01:26] you can solve a perfect example to do
[01:29] that is to look around if you have a job
[01:31] what's going on there uh maybe uh it
[01:33] could be a little piece of software for
[01:34] your team to be more productive during
[01:36] meeting using and AI uh video summary
[01:38] tool or something like that there are a
[01:39] bunch of uh problem that you can search
[01:41] around if this is not in your job you
[01:43] can look around in your hobbies for
[01:45] instance maybe you feel lonely playing
[01:47] tennis by yourself and you need to find
[01:48] a partners that are relevant um skills
[01:51] with you and you could make an app to
[01:53] find some of those people those kind of
[01:56] IDs are the best because first if your
[01:59] stup fail you still end up having a
[02:01] solution to your own problem so you're
[02:02] happy with that and second it's much
[02:04] easier to sell a uh software or whatever
[02:07] a product if you speak the language of
[02:09] your customer so if it's for a problem
[02:10] that you've been
[02:12] experiencing uh sometimes you might not
[02:14] have any uh problem in mind and you want
[02:17] to solve Universal problems un what I
[02:20] call Universal problems are problems
[02:21] like um every businesses want to make
[02:23] more money and everybody in life wants
[02:25] to have good quality sleep um eat
[02:28] healthy food and um whatever read books
[02:31] or be productive um those are PR that
[02:34] pretty much anyone could experience and
[02:35] those are good way to get started in
[02:37] entrepreneurship if you don't find any
[02:38] problem so for instance that's how I
[02:41] made my first internet uh dollar um I
[02:44] used to work with escape room businesses
[02:46] and I used to sell them a mini tool like
[02:48] a little piece of software that will
[02:50] help improve the conversions on their
[02:51] websites I do not care about the Escapo
[02:54] industry at all whatsoever but I found
[02:57] out that if I manage to get more money
[02:59] for for some businesses so Universal
[03:02] need using one of my uh software product
[03:04] then this is a perfect combo they're
[03:06] happy I'm happy uh this is a quick demo
[03:08] this is one of my customer um that is
[03:10] actually still paying after 5 years uh
[03:12] for my software this is an escape room
[03:14] business and they you they use my
[03:16] software at the bottom left this little
[03:18] key here will be shown to every visitor
[03:20] and if you visit the website of the
[03:21] escape room business you'll be able to
[03:22] play an escape room small online escape
[03:25] room game on the Business website so
[03:28] this is a tool that just in to convert
[03:30] to have some fun engaging game for
[03:32] visitors and to convert those visitors
[03:34] into more customers and in never Ed
[03:36] businesses that I work with would get
[03:38] 10% more customers from their website
[03:39] which is really great I ended up um
[03:42] ditching the business because I have no
[03:43] specific care for the Escape rooms
[03:44] industry but that was a really great way
[03:46] to get stting into entrepreneurship
[03:48] because you still have to build a
[03:50] product do the marketing launching and
[03:52] all that and in the case you have no uh
[03:55] problem that you want to solve and you
[03:58] uh you don't want to do this like
[03:59] solving those Universal problems there's
[04:01] nothing that comes to your mind you can
[04:03] try experiencing a brand new life uh
[04:05] that means traveling abroad and meeting
[04:07] new people that means starting a new
[04:09] hobby um try new stuff with an open mind
[04:12] where you will experience new problems
[04:14] that will come to your life and that
[04:15] could bring you some startups ideas once
[04:17] you get an IDE the next part is to
[04:19] actually build it and we're going to
[04:21] talk about this to make sure that you
[04:22] build it fast so in the case it's a flop
[04:24] you don't burn out all right so let me
[04:26] tell you a little story when I started
[04:28] entrepreneurship in 20 16 I believed I
[04:30] was Mark zukerberg and I had a secret
[04:33] brilliant ID in mind that was that was
[04:35] going to become a unicorn after spending
[04:37] a year in my bedroom building that ID I
[04:40] ended up having zero users and Zer in
[04:42] Revenue I burned out um I quit the
[04:45] product I couldn't see it anymore I also
[04:47] uh left my girlfriend and go change
[04:49] travel to a new country and change my
[04:51] life um the thing is when you spend so
[04:53] much time building a product the brain
[04:56] start to have some expectations and the
[04:57] more time you spend on it the more your
[04:58] expectations will be be so the better
[05:00] the reward will be expected and if the
[05:02] reward isn't uh coming as it's mostly
[05:04] the case in entrepreneurship you will
[05:06] burn out and you want to avoid that at
[05:07] all cost and the second reason is that
[05:10] most startups fail um the main reason is
[05:13] that people don't actually need the
[05:14] startup I think the number is around 90%
[05:16] of startup fail so you want to avoid um
[05:18] losing your time on something that might
[05:20] not even work out and so that's why U
[05:22] building and shipping fast is very
[05:24] important and at the same time when you
[05:26] ship fast you going to learn how to
[05:28] Market your startup how to launch it how
[05:30] to handle customer support tax legal and
[05:32] a bunch of other things that will be
[05:33] useful for the future and at the same
[05:36] times if you like um you know sharing
[05:39] what you uh learn along the way you can
[05:40] grow a little audience like I did in the
[05:42] last two years on my Twitter where uh
[05:44] now I have over 70k followers uh because
[05:47] I was sharing everything that I was
[05:48] doing and learning just like I'm doing
[05:49] now on YouTube all right so now that
[05:51] we've set up the mindset it's important
[05:53] to know which feature you will or will
[05:55] not build and as a general rule of themb
[05:58] build just one Fe feature that feature
[06:00] that you cannot remove from your product
[06:03] otherwise it just doesn't exist so for
[06:05] every feature that you have in mind ask
[06:06] yourself is it necessary for the users
[06:09] to have this feature if the answer is
[06:11] yes keep it but if it's not a necessary
[06:13] like absolute necessary feature just
[06:15] remove it let's get to a concrete
[06:18] example of Zenvo the startup that I'm
[06:20] building right now the goal is to
[06:22] simplify stripe invoices for small
[06:24] business owners like me and the main
[06:26] feature is just this people input their
[06:28] email and they get their invoice from
[06:30] stripe I have a bunch of other IDs for
[06:33] invoice so U business owners to be able
[06:34] to view all the invoices that have been
[06:36] generated um to simplify the texting to
[06:39] interact with a stripe API to upload
[06:41] those invoices and ab like really a
[06:43] numerous number of features that I want
[06:45] to implement but I'm going to launch
[06:47] with just one feature this one that I
[06:49] just show you right now which is
[06:50] generating invoices that way I will be
[06:52] able to launch my startup faster to get
[06:54] customers feedback earlier and it's
[06:57] likely that nobody will actually need
[06:59] the the product maybe it's just me or
[07:00] maybe I'm faking a need in my head and
[07:03] nobody will want to use it so this is
[07:05] why I will spend about 2 weeks finishing
[07:07] the product launch it and see how the
[07:09] market react and once you're going to go
[07:11] on launching your product the pricing is
[07:13] also very important because that will
[07:15] determine whether you validate or not a
[07:17] need um as a general Ru them there are
[07:20] two things you want to avoid or at least
[07:22] make better is at first you want to
[07:23] avoid free users um in the VC world it's
[07:26] very common to have um free plans and to
[07:29] burn a lot of money get a lot of users
[07:31] and then later convert those users into
[07:33] pay plans but as a solo entrepreneur uh
[07:35] like me if you have a limited budget you
[07:37] might not be able to burn lots of money
[07:39] or you might not be able to bring
[07:40] millions of visitors to your website and
[07:43] most of free users never convert to paid
[07:45] plans so if you have uh a pay a free
[07:48] plan that might be killing your paid
[07:50] plan and and reducing your uh actual
[07:52] income so you want to get rid of that
[07:54] the second part is that there is a real
[07:56] subscription headache going on out there
[07:58] there are subscriptions for
[07:59] absolutely everything nowadays and it's
[08:01] much harder to sell a $99 a month
[08:04] subscription than it is to sell a 100
[08:06] bucks onetime payment this is what I'm
[08:08] going to do for my new startup Zenvo um
[08:11] TR business owners could use my product
[08:13] every day every week so it could make
[08:15] sense to have some recurring payments
[08:17] but I'm not going to do that instead I'm
[08:18] going to go with one time payments and
[08:21] so that I can validate the le as soon as
[08:23] I can and if I see that there are some
[08:25] customers who actually use the product
[08:27] and want more of that then later on I
[08:29] can eventually switch to a recuring um
[08:32] membership but for now I'm going to
[08:33] stick to the simplest which is onetime
[08:35] payment and finally when you're about to
[08:36] build you want to choose a text tack so
[08:39] if you are a programmer and you already
[08:40] know your text tacks you're familiar
[08:42] with that you can build anything on web
[08:44] apps or whatever stick with it don't
[08:45] change it the customers don't care about
[08:47] the text tack so there is no need to
[08:48] change uh any of the things that you're
[08:49] using stick with what you already know
[08:51] and if you are getting started this is
[08:53] my textt here I'm using uh react and
[08:55] nextjs on top of it uh stripe for
[08:57] payments tailin CSS for the components
[09:00] uh with Daisy UI as a library mongodb as
[09:03] a database next authentification for uh
[09:06] user authentification accounts and all
[09:08] that and mail gun for uh email
[09:10] transactional emails uh this is also a
[09:13] little product that I built it's a ball
[09:14] plate that encapsulates all those uh
[09:17] stack that I'm using and if you want to
[09:19] check it out it's called chipas if you
[09:21] are curious about the coding part of it
[09:23] I am actually live streaming myself
[09:25] coding Zen voice in public on YouTube so
[09:28] you can see my YouTube channel all the
[09:30] replays from the last couple days uh you
[09:33] will see me mostly trying to debug my
[09:35] own code um currently the product is uh
[09:38] working so people can create accounts
[09:40] they can connect their stripe accounts
[09:41] to it and have a little link that they
[09:43] can share to the customers so they can
[09:45] input their email and retrieve their
[09:47] invoice edit them and download them um
[09:49] I'm going to spend the next weeks or so
[09:51] finishing the product before launching
[09:52] it on platforms like reddits productons
[09:55] and Twitter the strategy I'm using in
[09:57] this video about finding IDs and
[09:58] building them pass is the exact same
[10:00] strategy that I used to build my 21 side
[10:02] project and this is working better and
[10:04] better for me as you can see here my
[10:06] heat rate um is increasing in 2023 more
[10:09] of the startups that I built are
[10:11] profitable and making more money than
[10:13] they used to in 2022 when I got started
[10:15] from scratch I'm taking also YouTube
[10:18] seriously this year and I'm going to be
[10:19] sharing one video per week so if you
[10:22] want to uh see what I'm doing and what
[10:24] I'm learning uh you can subscribe to
[10:25] your channel and if you like the video
[10:26] you can like the video cheers
