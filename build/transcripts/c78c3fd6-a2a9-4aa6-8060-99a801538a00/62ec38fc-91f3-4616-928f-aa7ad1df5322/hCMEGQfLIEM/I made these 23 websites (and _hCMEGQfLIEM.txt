[00:00] in 2021 I was fired from a software
[00:02] engineer job and I decided to go solo
[00:04] and build my own websites today I have
[00:06] built 23 websites from software habit
[00:08] Strikers and AI tools and I do
[00:10] everything myself from the code the
[00:12] design and the marketing I'm going to
[00:13] show you every website that I made as
[00:15] well as the revenue it has generated
[00:17] you'll see that it's very uneven some
[00:18] never made money some made well over
[00:20] five figures and I'm also going to share
[00:22] three of those website that got acquired
[00:24] the first app I built right after I got
[00:26] fired is called mood to movie it's a
[00:27] movie recommendation based on your mood
[00:29] so if you feel like you're sleepy it's
[00:31] probably going to recommend you some
[00:32] action movies you can scroll through
[00:34] them and if for some reason you don't
[00:35] like the movie you can actually hide it
[00:37] and you will not see it again I never
[00:39] tried to monetize this app but the post
[00:41] went quite viral in total since I
[00:42] launched it it got 100,000 visitors one
[00:44] of the reason is because I posted on ION
[00:46] news I had zero audience back then and I
[00:48] made the post there as a nobody and the
[00:50] post went viral and I got I don't know I
[00:52] think about 10,000 visitors from that
[00:54] post and then it started some kind of
[00:56] like viral Loop where some people on Tik
[00:57] Tok would basically get this information
[01:00] and reshare it on other platforms that's
[01:01] probably why we see some spikes in
[01:04] traffic all around here and also I added
[01:06] a little joke it was not really intended
[01:08] but the horny mood it actually got
[01:10] people speak about this they seem like
[01:12] to enjoy the joke and that created some
[01:14] kind of like Word of Mouth organic word
[01:16] of mouth so pretty fun experience
[01:18] overall after m movie I thought of
[01:20] creating a project that potentially
[01:21] could generate Revenue so I'm a big fan
[01:23] of atomic habits the book and I thought
[01:26] what if we combine habits and games and
[01:28] I had this idea of building a habit
[01:30] tracker where you could stick your
[01:32] habits and it's going to grow a little
[01:34] garden a virtual Garden that you can
[01:36] friends can see so this is the landing
[01:37] page a few video demoing the product and
[01:40] it's priced at $9 per month or $54 per
[01:44] year when the users get access to the
[01:45] product they end up on their like a
[01:47] habit page where you can add any habits
[01:49] you want and then you can tick them and
[01:51] you have this habit grid that's going to
[01:53] fill so you see I've have not been
[01:54] really consistent recently and then you
[01:56] have missions so for instance if you
[01:58] show up every day you can open a box and
[02:00] that box will give you some little
[02:01] rewards so that you can plant flowers
[02:03] later in the game and you have a few
[02:05] achievement you have the streck system
[02:07] to gamify everything here is the little
[02:09] garden so you have different kinds of
[02:11] flowers they different Rarity you unlock
[02:13] them as you progress through the game
[02:15] and you can plant them with the gems you
[02:17] collected from the quests and there's
[02:18] also a social part where you can see
[02:21] what your friends are doing but there's
[02:22] a little Board of who's being the most
[02:24] consistent and you can see here I also
[02:26] managed to get 14,000 users on the app
[02:29] the traffic charts looks like this so I
[02:32] started launching the app on March 2022
[02:34] there has been a few spikes I'll will
[02:36] share which one of those later and the
[02:38] traffic has been pretty consistent with
[02:40] a few thousand visitors per month to
[02:41] launch the product I went on Hacker News
[02:43] for the second time and I got also
[02:45] really lucky the number of points here
[02:47] show that the app went quite viral and
[02:48] that explained the spike in April 2022
[02:51] where I get 14,000 visitors and thanks
[02:54] to that I also got the first customers
[02:56] for the first time since a long long
[02:58] time it was about 2 years ago since I
[02:59] haven't done any entrepreneurship
[03:01] projects I was really happy and I was so
[03:02] happy that actually my wife and I open a
[03:05] bottle of champagne I'm going to spare
[03:07] you the The
[03:09] Laughing there you go I spent about a
[03:11] year growing this habit tracker I will
[03:14] show you what the revenue looks like so
[03:16] I launched it about April 2022 and then
[03:19] the revenue was not crazy whatsoever it
[03:21] was about hundred few hundred per month
[03:23] at this point I decided to remove the
[03:25] free plan and the revenue really went up
[03:27] and then I stopped working on the app so
[03:29] obviously the revenue went down later
[03:31] and for the monthly recuring Revenue it
[03:33] went to something like $300 per month in
[03:36] recuring Revenue I also built an app IOS
[03:39] and Android app you can find it actually
[03:41] on the store still so it also had some
[03:43] Revenue coming from the stores I think
[03:44] it's about an extra 50% so probably at
[03:47] the peak it was about $500 Mr and
[03:49] because I stopped working on the app the
[03:50] revenue obviously went down and around
[03:52] this time someone on Twitter reached out
[03:54] to me and offered to buy the product
[03:56] that's why the revenue is actually zero
[03:58] right now because we did transition to
[04:00] its own stripe accounts so I ended up
[04:02] selling the Habit tracker to that person
[04:03] for $10,000 so in total it made almost
[04:06] $6,000 in Revenue plus around $2,000
[04:09] from the IOS and Android store so that's
[04:12] roughly 17 to $18,000 at this point I'm
[04:16] trying to grow my habit tracker but I am
[04:17] a developer and I love creating stuff
[04:19] too much and so I try to find some
[04:21] clever way to do marketing by creating
[04:23] things and came up with books calculator
[04:25] it's basically a mini app that if you
[04:26] tell it how much you want to read every
[04:28] day at which speed for how long you're
[04:31] going to be able to read these many
[04:32] books and it's going to show you some of
[04:34] the books you can read it's basically a
[04:35] way to visualize your habits over the
[04:37] long run and if you curse and you say oh
[04:39] I want some motivation to read more then
[04:41] he's going to do a little promotion for
[04:42] habits Garden I launched the tool on
[04:44] producton Twitter and everything and I
[04:46] don't remember why there was a spike in
[04:48] traffic at the beginning but it happened
[04:49] and then the traffic has been pretty
[04:51] consistent over time and it's now a
[04:52] little bit growing at this point on
[04:54] Twitter I heard some people talking
[04:55] about programmatic SEO and I am totally
[04:58] new to SEO so I was like oh let's try
[05:00] programmatic SEO for this project see if
[05:02] I can learn something and I realized
[05:03] that for books there's some keywords
[05:05] that are easier to rank and so I created
[05:08] all those pages so if you type here for
[05:09] instance I build programmatically all
[05:12] those pages so I think maybe they're
[05:14] like over 300 Pages ranking on Google
[05:16] probably at the moment as you can see
[05:17] here we have one page another page and
[05:19] so I'm basically trying to rank a bunch
[05:21] of URLs on Google and traffic wise in
[05:23] the search console so Google will not
[05:25] let me show you the data before December
[05:27] but I started as zero like any project
[05:29] and there was nothing for a month and
[05:31] then someday at some point Google
[05:32] started to pick my URLs and started to
[05:34] send some traffic to it and it's not
[05:37] crazy but it's driving few dozens of
[05:38] clicks per day and it doesn't look like
[05:40] it's going to stop so it's not making
[05:42] any money but it's bringing some traffic
[05:43] and it's sending the traffic to The
[05:44] Habit tracker the fourth website I buil
[05:46] is called 50 hacks it's a list of the
[05:49] best productivity hack on the internet
[05:51] so anyone can post a new productivity
[05:54] hack like uh I don't know like no phone
[05:56] in the morning or Airplane Mode whatever
[05:58] this is that his is helping you and then
[06:00] anyone as well without an account can
[06:02] like or dislike those posts I try to
[06:05] mimic what's happening on Reddit so
[06:06] there is a Hot Tab where you would
[06:08] basically see the most recent hacks
[06:11] posted that got the most engagement you
[06:13] have the new one where people basically
[06:15] the most recent post and you have the
[06:16] top ones all time and for each of them
[06:19] you can go click it and you can have a
[06:21] conversation with other users on the
[06:22] platform again without an account I
[06:24] launched it on product T and for the
[06:26] first time ever I got a badge and it
[06:28] ended up being second product of the day
[06:29] so I was so happy and that also helped
[06:32] my Twitter account grow a little bit so
[06:33] I started to have a little audience
[06:35] traffic-wise it got a big burst at the
[06:38] very beginning 45,000 visitor on the
[06:40] month of the launch and in total so far
[06:42] 200,000 visitors that's quite a lot
[06:44] because it went viral a little bit
[06:45] everywhere people would restare this on
[06:47] Twitter Tik Tok and everything and and
[06:49] consistently there will be some new
[06:50] people coming onto the platform and so I
[06:52] decided to monetize it with
[06:54] advertisement so at the bottom of each
[06:56] post there will be an ad placement as
[06:58] well as somewhere yeah you can see here
[07:01] this is an ad for instance for actually
[07:03] one of my products dog fooding my own
[07:05] product and at the bottom there is
[07:06] another Banner here that is an ad as
[07:08] well and if I'm not mistaken to promote
[07:11] to advertise on 50 hacks yeah so this is
[07:13] the pay wall to advertise on 50 hack
[07:15] it's connected directly to my analytics
[07:17] dashboard and is going to show you how
[07:19] much traffic you can expect to get on
[07:21] your site and there is a payment link it
[07:23] didn't make a lot of money but it made
[07:25] $350 which is pretty fun for a project
[07:28] like this one some when in the summer of
[07:30] 2022 I was traveling from Indonesia to
[07:33] France and I set myself a stupid
[07:35] challenge of building an entire app
[07:37] within the plane and I commented on
[07:39] Twitter so that I had something to
[07:40] deliver and I managed to deliver a
[07:42] little something it's called body Crush
[07:44] it's a accountability groups for uh
[07:47] friends this is the landing page here
[07:48] and then when you sign up you can join
[07:51] uh groups with people and you can
[07:53] complete your habits and you can see
[07:55] what they completed so you can either
[07:56] create a new group or you can join an
[07:59] existing group so you have groups for uh
[08:01] I don't know people who wants to tweet
[08:03] every day people to want to become game
[08:04] developers Health Group like workout
[08:06] stretch every day and all those kind of
[08:08] like daily habits and when you complete
[08:10] your habit is going to show some little
[08:12] Comet I launched it on product T and to
[08:14] my surprise he also got a badge third
[08:16] product of the day which is amazing for
[08:17] a very tiny product like this one I
[08:19] guess it's because I got so much love
[08:21] from people on Twitter that they helped
[08:23] and pushed the launch a little bit
[08:25] higher traffic-wise nothing as much as
[08:27] the previous apps about 10,000 visitors
[08:29] in total and the app was free and it's
[08:31] still 100% free so no revenue generated
[08:34] for this one then I also built this
[08:35] little game called decision game the ID
[08:38] is if you have two options like you
[08:40] hesitate between let's say a burger and
[08:42] a pizza then when you press Start you
[08:44] have the overthinking monsters that try
[08:46] to eat Kitty and you have to choose one
[08:48] or the other before the monster actually
[08:49] eats the cat and when you press the cat
[08:53] is happy and your score is saved in the
[08:55] database and you can see there are
[08:57] 25,000 people who won the game and 5,000
[09:00] who let the overthinking Monster eat the
[09:02] cat traffic-wise it was about 32,000
[09:04] visitors so I launched around here he
[09:06] got decent traffic and then now it's
[09:08] almost to zero every month one of the
[09:10] reason I buil this game was to promote
[09:12] habits Garden my habit tracker shortly
[09:14] after that I realized I already built a
[09:16] bunch of apps that use games in order to
[09:18] achieve real life goals so I decided to
[09:20] create a gamify list it's a directory of
[09:23] gamification app so whether you're
[09:24] trying to learn math JavaScript Finance
[09:27] building habits any app that will used
[09:29] games will appear in here and so I paid
[09:32] someone on um I think it was upwork to
[09:34] gather some information about games so
[09:36] we have the famous duelingo we have my
[09:38] decision game here we have my habit
[09:40] tracker here and also apps like Strava
[09:42] that use some leaderboards and things
[09:43] like that and each app would get a page
[09:46] so for dualingo for instance people can
[09:48] actually leave reviews you would have
[09:50] some information about the app is it
[09:51] free is it not free where you can use it
[09:53] related apps and you can also search
[09:55] apps by categories let's say carrier you
[09:57] can have apps to I don't know do
[09:59] something like team buildings and all
[10:00] that traffic wise we are at a pretty
[10:03] decent traffic I launched but nothing
[10:05] crazy happened but you I'll show you why
[10:07] it's getting consistent traffic with
[10:09] about 30,000 visitors on the app so far
[10:11] it's because um I didn't know it was
[10:13] random but actually I rank for some
[10:15] keywords like for instance you can see
[10:17] basker here there are some keywords that
[10:19] start to rank for those apps and somehow
[10:21] people find the app valuable so Google
[10:23] keep pushing and giving me some more
[10:25] Impressions every month I Tred to
[10:26] capitalize on the traffic and add a
[10:28] monetization on the app so you can
[10:30] promote your own app it will be featured
[10:32] on some different places on the site
[10:34] it's been a few months now and I managed
[10:35] to get zero customers at the end of the
[10:38] year 2022 I started building an app
[10:40] called visualize habit it's basically an
[10:43] extension of books calculator you can
[10:44] pick any habits say how much you going
[10:46] to do per day how many days per week and
[10:48] it's going to show you some nice visuals
[10:50] on what you can achieve over a year and
[10:52] then you can build your little habits
[10:53] card where you can see all the habits
[10:55] you want to pick and some fun things
[10:57] like I don't know if you read 18 books
[10:59] you read for like 3 days and 19 hours in
[11:01] total for instance so let me show you
[11:03] how that works let's say I'm going to
[11:04] build on my habit gried and I want to
[11:06] code I don't know 30 minutes uh three
[11:08] times a week and I want to walk let's
[11:10] say 10 minutes every day and when you
[11:12] press enter then you're going to see
[11:14] your habits gri I call it this way
[11:17] pretty visual there's a way to share
[11:19] your card so you will download the photo
[11:20] and you can send it to any friends it's
[11:22] a little promotion for my habit tracker
[11:24] habits garden and when you click on this
[11:26] link it's going to open automatically
[11:28] the app habit garden and it's going to
[11:30] import all the habits the person wanted
[11:32] to build so there is a little onboarding
[11:34] flow and you can see you can take your
[11:35] new walk habit and then yeah that's
[11:37] typical of morning flow for habit Garden
[11:40] traffic wise it was probably one of the
[11:42] best launch I've ever made the month I
[11:44] launched so it shows the traffic for
[11:45] January but because I launched it I
[11:47] think by the end of the year so that's
[11:48] probably the New Year resolution time
[11:50] that's also helping a lot it went viral
[11:52] on Reddit and other platforms and it got
[11:55] a golden Kitt award from productons and
[11:57] as well as a producton badge you part of
[11:59] it is because I started to make those
[12:00] videos where I would plug myself into a
[12:04] popular movie or a popular podcast and
[12:07] promote my app in my YouTube channel if
[12:08] you want you'll see a bunch of those
[12:10] videos they do usually do pretty well on
[12:12] Twitter because they're pretty new and
[12:14] people were not expecting to see these
[12:15] from a mini startup fer So that
[12:17] obviously brought a lot of traffic to
[12:19] the app and managed to get a bunch of
[12:21] signups for habits Garden I built
[12:23] another habit tracker style I promise
[12:25] this is the last one it's called heroit
[12:27] where basically you pick a workout
[12:29] Avatar and every day when you work out
[12:31] you're going to grow your little Avatar
[12:32] he got the product tant product of the
[12:34] day which I was really really happy with
[12:36] when you sign up you have your this is
[12:38] your dashboard so those are my avatars
[12:40] let's say I surf this morning you can
[12:42] complete and you get a little bit of XP
[12:44] you can also create new avatars by
[12:45] choosing whatever sports that you like
[12:48] save the frequency and then create your
[12:49] avatar there's also a mobile app for
[12:51] hero fits it's available on the app
[12:54] store and on the Android store same as I
[12:56] did for habits Garden it's called
[12:57] capacitor it's a tech that will
[12:59] basically take all my HTML CSS files and
[13:02] put them into a web view that is going
[13:04] to run on any device and So within a few
[13:07] days I had the app live on the stores I
[13:09] actually built this app Live on YouTube
[13:11] if you find somewhere in my channel some
[13:13] of the first streams I did for I think
[13:15] what seven days yeah spent seven days
[13:16] building the product I did it live while
[13:18] I was actually eating some days I would
[13:20] spend 10 hours on the stream and bunch
[13:23] of people from Twitter would come and
[13:25] debug me help me with the design like
[13:27] Manu I remember is the one who helped me
[13:29] me make those acute Avatar things over
[13:31] was a really fun experience and so when
[13:33] I launched on product hunt I managed to
[13:34] get the product of the Day badge thanks
[13:37] to the community of people who actually
[13:39] help and supported the launch and
[13:41] traffic-wise nothing crazy but still
[13:43] pretty decent and for some reason it's
[13:44] still getting some monthly traffic and
[13:46] of course I tried to add a paid plan to
[13:49] add more avatars but I think I made like
[13:51] probably $30 of Sales Early 2023
[13:55] everybody was talking about Ai and I
[13:56] wanted to build an app that uses CH GPT
[13:59] and I was totally new to AI so I reached
[14:01] out to my friend called Martin and
[14:03] together we built Naval AI it's a little
[14:05] chatbot on messenger and on Telegram and
[14:08] WhatsApp that's using CH pt4 that was
[14:10] trained on naval's tweet Naval ravikant
[14:13] and then inside of your WhatsApp you can
[14:15] ask question to Naval at least what's
[14:17] looks like a version of Naval it's a
[14:20] fairly simple landing page I also made a
[14:22] little funish video about the product
[14:25] where I was actually talking to naal
[14:27] here I was wondering how do become
[14:29] famous like you being a celebrity is no
[14:32] good uh same it's also available in my
[14:34] YouTube channel if you want to have a
[14:35] look at it we disconnected the app cuz
[14:37] it was a little bit pricey and some
[14:39] people were abusing the system and it's
[14:41] not like it was a business we just did
[14:43] this for fun so I think we made a few
[14:44] hundred I don't have access to a stripe
[14:46] account and traffic-wise we had a decent
[14:49] traffic for a tiny app like this one to
[14:51] stay on the naval Trend I built Naval 25
[14:54] so I pulled 300 quotes from Naval and
[14:56] put them on a little website and they
[14:58] are organized by the most liked one and
[15:00] people can vote for them if they want
[15:02] where you have random Cotes and you have
[15:03] to choose the one you like the most and
[15:04] you have 25 votes this one is pretty
[15:06] nice and then it's going to increase the
[15:08] counters and update the page every day
[15:10] or every 12 hours it's a very simple app
[15:12] I did just for fun and it didn't get
[15:14] much traffic okay so this is the last
[15:16] app I built that did not make money it's
[15:18] called fake it until you make it it's an
[15:20] app that's available on IOS and Android
[15:22] it's a very simple app you can basically
[15:24] send yourself fake payment notification
[15:26] that look like the stripe notifications
[15:27] you would use it either to prank your
[15:29] friends or to motivate yourself to go
[15:31] back and grind and do the work the link
[15:32] page is pretty simple I made a video in
[15:34] The Wolf of Wall Street and this video
[15:36] actually got a bunch of attention and
[15:38] that's the moment where my Twitter
[15:40] account started to grow back then the
[15:41] app was paid I think I made probably two
[15:43] sales actually it made a little bit of
[15:44] money like probably like something like
[15:45] $30 I made the app free now and instead
[15:48] I'm adding a promotion for another
[15:50] product of mine I'm going to show you
[15:51] later at this point I had built over 10
[15:54] products and I had a little portfolio
[15:55] website for myself where I would show
[15:57] little cards of the things that I built
[15:59] and I got good feedback from people on
[16:01] Twitter so I decided to make it a
[16:03] product and so I built Indie page it's
[16:05] like link tree for entrepreneurs where
[16:07] you can have your own profile
[16:08] descriptions and show all of your
[16:10] startups there about 5,000 solopreneur
[16:12] registered and the profiles are public
[16:14] so this is for instance the profile of
[16:15] Martin you can see his uh Revenue you
[16:18] can see all of his startups link just
[16:20] like you would do on link tree and you
[16:21] have some other cool features like you
[16:23] have some analytics you can personalize
[16:24] your page you can connect a newsletter
[16:26] and it's priced at $25 for one year
[16:29] access or $45 for an entire lifetime
[16:31] deal this is my Indie page dashboard so
[16:33] you see in my profile I can do anything
[16:36] here I can use markdown to update my B
[16:38] right here I can connect my newsletter
[16:40] like substack or beehive and then I can
[16:42] add any startup I want I can drag and
[16:45] drop and reorganize them hide them add
[16:47] some new startups I can also connect
[16:48] them with stripe so that's what I do for
[16:51] all my startup I add a stripe restricted
[16:53] API key to Indie page and it's going to
[16:55] fetch automatically the revenue from
[16:57] stripe so that the revenue is
[16:58] automatically updated every 12 hours and
[17:01] then I can personalize my page so I can
[17:03] change uh the font I can change the
[17:05] colors for instance I can do literally a
[17:08] bunch of things and I have access to
[17:09] some analytics so I can see the total
[17:11] visitors on my Indie page I can see
[17:14] where the peoples are coming from I can
[17:15] see which links they click and few other
[17:18] things like this and finally people can
[17:19] connect their own domain name so it
[17:21] looks like a really a portfolio website
[17:24] I try to make a kind of like a clone of
[17:26] product tant where startups will be
[17:28] displayed on a discovery page and people
[17:30] can upvote those it got some attention
[17:33] but it did not do anything crazy when I
[17:35] launched on producton back then it ended
[17:37] up being product of the day I was really
[17:39] happy I think it was one of my best
[17:40] launch so far and traffic-wise there has
[17:43] been almost 200,000 visitors that's
[17:45] quite a lot it's also because some
[17:47] people share the Indie page to Their
[17:48] audience so it also brings some extra
[17:50] traffic for instance this is my own
[17:52] Indie page and revenue wise this is an
[17:54] old strap account I disconnected it in
[17:56] January so you would add three, ,000 in
[17:59] Revenue to this so it made a little bit
[18:01] above $1,000 with something ranging from
[18:05] 500 to$ 1,200 every month I wanted to
[18:08] play with AI a little bit more so I
[18:10] created Mech Ling it's a website
[18:12] generator using AI so people would type
[18:15] some text and the AI will create a
[18:16] landing page for that query it would add
[18:19] pictures text and buttons the landing
[18:20] page is fairly simple it shows some
[18:22] customers demo as you can see here two
[18:24] features and the price has changed but
[18:26] when I started it was a onetime payment
[18:28] like something $30 per landing page so
[18:30] let me show you the dashboard uh let me
[18:31] pick one website and there are a bunch
[18:34] of features on each of those websites
[18:36] I'm going to show a demo of each of them
[18:38] so this is the website editor by default
[18:40] is going to generate the website and
[18:42] then the customer can do anything they
[18:44] want so uh you can change the text you
[18:46] can add some new buttons you can change
[18:49] where those buttons will go you can
[18:51] change the font the colors the themes
[18:54] there really are many things you can do
[18:56] here you can also add sections so there
[18:58] are few like headers testimonials ctas
[19:02] pricing really a bunch of things here I
[19:04] basically took all the components I
[19:05] built for my previous website and I try
[19:07] to put them in this site and when
[19:09] someone adds a website it will normally
[19:11] I think if I remember well is going to
[19:14] populate create some uh text using CH
[19:16] GPT and sometimes if it's working it
[19:19] should create an an image with AI the
[19:22] customers can also use let's say with
[19:24] typ PCAT they can also use the unsplash
[19:26] library and add anything they want in
[19:28] here so I'm going to remove that section
[19:30] because it's not supposed to be here and
[19:32] the user can preview the website on
[19:34] mobile laptop whatever so that they know
[19:37] what how the page will look like and
[19:39] when they're ready they can actually
[19:40] deploy the site to their own domain name
[19:43] or they can export the code to HTML and
[19:45] there are also a few analytics like how
[19:47] many visitors on the site same I reuse
[19:49] what I use for my other product in the
[19:51] page same components applied here
[19:53] traffic wise it went pretty well it's a
[19:55] trendy AI product so a bunch of visitors
[19:58] over 10,000 visitors per month and
[20:00] revenue wise I started under a different
[20:02] branding it started as lending AI it
[20:05] made about 7,000 us and then I rebranded
[20:08] to make lending later because lending AI
[20:10] was actually used by a big software
[20:12] company and it made another uh 8.6 th000
[20:16] so in total it was something around
[20:18] 167,000 and Tech wise I was spending
[20:20] about 10% of the profit for open EI
[20:23] credits so for copy generation with chbt
[20:26] and for the image generation using
[20:27] stable diffusion around November
[20:29] December 2023 I realized I was competing
[20:32] against uh big companies like framer uh
[20:35] Squarespace even WordPress like all
[20:36] those website builder and so it was kind
[20:38] of hard to know how to take the product
[20:40] to the next level and I decided to sell
[20:42] the product so I listed it on acquire
[20:44] and within a few weeks the deal was done
[20:47] and made $35,000 in sale from this
[20:50] startup and so in total for Ming I made
[20:53] a little bit over
[20:54] $50,000 I stayed in the AI world and I
[20:57] created work book PDF it's a little
[20:59] platform where you can generate
[21:01] exercises to learn a new language on the
[21:03] topics that you love so let's say you
[21:04] want to learn French and you love food
[21:06] you can create a workbook with exercises
[21:09] all about food so you would get
[21:10] exercises with word related to food as
[21:12] well as some like a food uh cultural
[21:15] facts and interesting things the Ling
[21:16] page looks like this there is a little
[21:18] demo of the workbook so people know what
[21:21] they are purchasing and the pricing it's
[21:23] a day pass so if you access the product
[21:25] for 30day you will pay $30 I they don't
[21:28] want to go for subscriptions because I'm
[21:30] a big fan of no subscription as a
[21:32] customer I don't like subscriptions so I
[21:34] would like to avoid subscriptions if I
[21:35] can and when you get access to one of
[21:37] those PS you can basically generate any
[21:38] workbooks on the student side this is
[21:40] what you will see you can create a
[21:42] workbook where you would pick the
[21:43] language you actually want to learn you
[21:45] would choose the level you're at and you
[21:46] would pick the topic that you're
[21:48] interested in and once the workbook is
[21:49] generated you will have this little page
[21:52] right here where you have exercises
[21:53] where you have to match words some
[21:55] interesting cultural facts complete the
[21:57] sentence find the right missing words
[21:59] and all these kind of grammar vocabulary
[22:01] things you can also download it as a PDF
[22:04] file so that you can print it and do it
[22:07] without a computer traffic-wise it also
[22:09] went pretty well I launched it on AI
[22:11] directory tools and it's still getting
[22:13] consistent traffic but it's not really
[22:15] making much money it made some money
[22:16] during the launch time and then now it's
[22:19] a few dozen dollars per month at this
[22:22] point I was doing the same thing over
[22:23] and over like set up a landing page send
[22:25] emails to customer to confirm their
[22:27] login listen for for stripe events so I
[22:29] can update the user in the database and
[22:31] all that and I decided to make a little
[22:32] boiler plate for myself so I can reuse
[22:34] it for all my projects and I thought why
[22:36] not making it open so that anyone can
[22:38] use it and so I created chip fast it's a
[22:40] codebase for developers to launch their
[22:43] startups faster this is the Ling page
[22:45] here and we have a little demo of the
[22:47] product which is me with a beard
[22:49] explaining what's going on in the boiler
[22:51] plate it's price uh like this at the
[22:53] moment and we have some testimonials
[22:55] here and one of the biggest thing for
[22:58] the spiler plate is that I was a nobody
[23:00] for years like for six years I was no
[23:03] one literally like doing project that
[23:04] nobody wanted to use and seeing that I
[23:07] received hundreds of messages from
[23:09] people who purchased sh fast and that
[23:11] say that it changed their lives it made
[23:13] me just so so so happy yeah enough of me
[23:15] bragging but the testimonials are one of
[23:17] the most precious thing I got from this
[23:19] B plate so it is a codebase so it's
[23:22] available on GitHub and there's also a
[23:24] little documentation that helps the
[23:26] people to get started set up their
[23:27] landing page shut up stripe and all that
[23:29] kind of things there also a bunch of
[23:30] components as I keep making new apps I
[23:33] add new components to the bo plate so
[23:35] it's more complete traffic wise it is
[23:37] probably the app that got the most
[23:39] traffic I've ever had 4,000 visitors in
[23:42] the last 6 months or so maybe 7 months
[23:45] now most is coming from social media so
[23:47] like Twitter and YouTube and also some
[23:49] word of mouth and financially this is
[23:51] the first trap account I had I
[23:53] disconnected it in early January so
[23:55] that's uh a little bit over $200,000 us
[23:58] Genera since the launch plus another
[24:01] $176,000 and something like probably
[24:03] $8,000 collected from other payments
[24:05] like PayPal so in total she F made
[24:08] $380,000 in Revenue had to turn on the
[24:11] lights it's getting dark here I built by
[24:13] dispute it's a little software that
[24:15] helps prevent disputes or chargeback
[24:17] happening on stripe quick backstory when
[24:19] I was working on hadits Garden the first
[24:21] five payments that were made were made
[24:23] with a fraudulent credit card so someone
[24:25] testing a stolen credit card on my site
[24:27] and the payment went through and I was
[24:29] banned like literally banned from stripe
[24:31] overnight and luckily I had a little
[24:33] audience on Twitter back then and I
[24:35] managed to speak with someone who had a
[24:37] deeper look at my account and reinstated
[24:39] it but I was really really scared so
[24:41] this product by dispute aims at reducing
[24:43] chances that you have fraudulent
[24:44] payments in your account I show some
[24:46] examples of you know like if this
[24:48] happened then do that there is also this
[24:51] little component here so some solo
[24:53] entrepreneurs like myself back then have
[24:55] no clue that you could get in trouble
[24:56] for a few disputes on Stripes so but
[24:58] this is what I try to highlight on this
[25:00] page and then I have a few demo of the
[25:02] product and we have the pricing section
[25:05] here where it's basically a pay per
[25:06] transaction the more transaction you
[25:09] protect the cheaper it gets and on the
[25:11] dashboard size this is what it looks
[25:12] like so this is my I actually use that
[25:14] product for all of my other products so
[25:17] you would add a new stripe account by
[25:19] dispute would listen to events on your
[25:20] stripe accounts and based on the rules
[25:22] you set up it will try to prevent some
[25:24] fraudulent actions so you would add new
[25:26] rules like let's say if a credit card
[25:28] was reported stolen then refund the last
[25:30] payment and then there is a little
[25:32] notification tab where this is the
[25:34] actual data that's happening on my
[25:36] account and you can directly go to your
[25:37] stripe account to check the transactions
[25:39] or sometimes even just refund it or send
[25:42] yourself an email or all this kind of
[25:44] like uh prevention traffic wise it's
[25:46] still pretty decent couple thousand
[25:47] visitors during the launch nice and
[25:49] MoneyWise it made
[25:52] $32,000 when I launched it and then as
[25:54] for other accounts I had to swap my
[25:56] account and it made another 700 50 bucks
[25:59] this year so we are almost at $4,000 in
[26:01] revenue for any new product I launch I
[26:03] created one funish video that I would
[26:06] post on social media so either I would
[26:08] go with Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of
[26:10] Wall Street or I would play World of
[26:12] Warcraft in real life and those videos
[26:15] really helped me Kickstart the journey
[26:17] it would create an initial boost on all
[26:19] my launch and get the first visitors and
[26:21] people on Twitter love the video so I
[26:22] decided to make a mini course so this is
[26:24] the landing page where I'm basically
[26:26] telling my story exactly how it happened
[26:28] with seen here the first video I made
[26:29] with jogan for the product visualized
[26:31] habits that started to Kink things off
[26:33] and then the story as it is today where
[26:36] most of my product actually end up
[26:37] getting a product on badge and even I
[26:40] got some big names in the game that were
[26:42] reaching out to me that say they love
[26:44] the videos so the landing page would
[26:45] show some features like everything that
[26:47] the course is about little hints most of
[26:50] the fun jokes are made with AI I'm
[26:53] actually not a smart guy and another
[26:54] funny guy as well but the AI chpt is
[26:57] really good at crafting jokes and that
[26:58] is what I use to make those videos and I
[27:00] also use AI to create fake backgrounds
[27:03] and create those like a fake characters
[27:04] in the movie The course looks like this
[27:07] so this is the curriculum on the left
[27:08] and on the right there are all the
[27:10] videos where I basically explain
[27:11] everything that I do how to do step by
[27:13] step from the script to shooting
[27:15] yourself editing the movie and also
[27:17] break down some of the videos that I
[27:19] made traffic wise it's doing pretty
[27:21] decent it's also connected to my Twitter
[27:23] so the traffic is coming from there and
[27:25] financially it made 6.7 th000 last year
[27:28] and this year it made 88.7 th000 so a
[27:32] total of about
[27:33] $15,000 the next website is called logas
[27:36] it's a free tool to generate a little
[27:38] icons so for every website I make I
[27:41] always do the same process I take an SVG
[27:43] and I just change the width and add some
[27:45] colors and this is the logo for all my
[27:47] products and I thought why not making it
[27:49] a product itself and so you would go
[27:51] here choose whatever icon you want and
[27:53] then you can change uh the size of the
[27:54] icon you can change the width of uh the
[27:56] borders change the colors everything
[27:58] there are some presets like this like
[28:00] that rounded whatever you want you can
[28:02] also ask AI to make a logo for you so
[28:05] you can describe your business and it
[28:06] will suggest some icons and matching
[28:08] colors and here on the right side
[28:09] there's a little promotion for my sh
[28:11] fast B plate so that hopefully it's
[28:13] paying back the time I invested for this
[28:14] product I launched it on product tun and
[28:16] it was I think my best launch so far so
[28:18] product of the day product of the week
[28:20] and second product of the month as well
[28:22] as a goldon kitty award for 2023 I was
[28:25] so happy I guess it's uh this video who
[28:27] helped a lot where I'm playing
[28:30] with Matthew M people loved it and
[28:33] obviously that spread the word out and
[28:35] the launch went quite viral at the same
[28:37] time when people download their logo
[28:39] right here is going to save those logos
[28:41] in my database and I created a little
[28:43] directory of logos made with logo fast
[28:46] and if you go here you can see for
[28:48] instance a logo made for uh softwares
[28:50] and you can see some of the logos that
[28:52] were made and if you click on some of
[28:54] them you can actually save it on your
[28:56] local browser or you can download it or
[28:58] you can even edit it and then it's going
[29:00] to open Logo fast and let you edit that
[29:02] SV the purpose of this experiment is to
[29:04] rank some pages on Google I tried
[29:06] earlier this year and Google has already
[29:08] ranked over 2,000 pages so if you search
[29:11] for icons for a SAS for instance you
[29:13] might find one of the icons generated
[29:15] with logo fast it didn't make any money
[29:17] directly but thanks to the promotion for
[29:18] ship fast it generated some sales
[29:20] although I didn't trke any of them when
[29:22] I realized I gave stripe over ,000 just
[29:25] to generate PDF invoices I decided to
[29:28] build my own product so I don't have to
[29:29] pay the stripe fee so I created Z
[29:31] invoice this is the Ling page though the
[29:33] typical when you create invoice with
[29:34] stripe for one time payment you can pay
[29:36] up to $1 per invoice and with invoice
[29:38] it's a onetime payment and you can
[29:39] generate as many invoices as you want
[29:41] the current pricing is this way it's a
[29:43] onetime payment of $49 or 69 for
[29:45] unlimited strap accounts and then the
[29:47] customers going end up on their
[29:48] dashboard where they have a unique link
[29:50] that looks like this that they can send
[29:52] to the customers so that the customers
[29:53] can automatically generate their
[29:54] invoices the users can edit the details
[29:56] they want to show on their invoice so
[29:58] they can change your business name the
[29:59] customer support emails their V8 numbers
[30:01] and all that and on the customer side
[30:03] when they send the link to the customers
[30:05] they'll land on this page where they can
[30:07] retrieve invoices or actually they can
[30:09] retrieve any payments made for the
[30:11] business and when they click here
[30:12] they'll get an email that looks like
[30:14] this and when they click on this link
[30:16] they would end up on this page where
[30:18] they can see all the payments they made
[30:19] for the business and they can download
[30:21] their invoice as well as edit a few
[30:23] information if they made a mistake in
[30:25] the name or if they want to change the
[30:26] vat number for instance and financially
[30:28] wise it made a little bit over $4,000
[30:31] for the past 2 month of running the
[30:32] product and my most recent product is
[30:34] called poop up it's a little pluging
[30:36] that lets your website show some
[30:38] notifications like the one at the top
[30:39] right I created it after Zenvo because
[30:41] people love the notification I even got
[30:43] the attention of gearmo the CEO of
[30:45] versal which was absolutely amazing so
[30:48] this is how the lending page looks like
[30:50] um we have a little demo of the product
[30:51] with some of the features some use cases
[30:54] and the pricing here so it's price one
[30:56] time payment $9 for one website and $19
[30:59] for unlimited websites the user
[31:01] dashboards looks like this so people
[31:03] would add their website here and then
[31:05] they could click on it and they can
[31:06] customize anything from when to show the
[31:08] message to when should they hide the
[31:10] message and they can also customize the
[31:11] message itself so they can drag and drop
[31:13] to reorganize uh change the text change
[31:15] the icons as they want and at the bottom
[31:17] there is a little script to add to their
[31:19] website for the pop-ups to show up and
[31:21] when it's going to work is going to look
[31:22] like a little bit like this here you go
[31:26] and revenue wise it made three 32,000
[31:28] since the launch which was like a little
[31:30] bit over a month ago so pretty nice for
[31:32] a tiny product like this one it took me
[31:34] 3 days to create this product I'll link
[31:36] to another video here if you are curious
[31:37] about the tricks I use to build fast
[31:40] there are two more softwares I would
[31:41] like to show you that I created at the
[31:43] very beginning of the journey when I was
[31:44] learning how to code so the past two
[31:45] years or so I was a solo entrepreneur
[31:48] making all those projects I showed you
[31:49] and then prior to that I was working as
[31:51] a software engineer for a company and
[31:52] prior to that I was learning how to code
[31:54] and I created those softwares and the
[31:56] first one I created is called virally
[31:58] Bots it's the Ling page you can see here
[32:00] it's basically a little messenger
[32:02] Facebook Messenger bot to increase
[32:04] escape room businesses conversions so I
[32:06] would work with escap room business
[32:08] where you would go with your friends to
[32:09] solve Clues and puzzles and I would
[32:11] connect a little messenger bot to their
[32:13] Facebook page so it would look like this
[32:14] their users would type on the buttons on
[32:17] their Facebook Messenger app and the bot
[32:18] will automatically replies with a few
[32:20] games you could have puzzles like solve
[32:22] this puzzle here solve that puzzle and
[32:25] they would get some points and when they
[32:27] get enough points they can get a
[32:29] discount coupon for the escape room
[32:30] business I was working with and so my
[32:31] customers would use these fun messenger
[32:34] games to convince their own customers
[32:36] that they are the best escape rooms in
[32:37] town as I was learning how to code this
[32:39] is basically just a lending page there
[32:41] is no user account if they want to get
[32:43] started they would have to email me and
[32:45] I would have to manually go to their
[32:46] Facebook page to connect a messenger bot
[32:48] and I remember taking a course on UD me
[32:50] where the teacher was explaining how to
[32:52] interact with a Facebook API and I just
[32:54] copy pasted what I had deployed a
[32:57] node.js uh server I think he was Heroku
[32:59] back then and it was working and I was
[33:01] just adding some more messages I
[33:03] literally had no real understanding of
[33:05] what was actually going on and so I
[33:06] spent a little bit over a year on this
[33:08] business it's actually how I made my
[33:10] first internet Dollar online so it
[33:12] generated a little bit over $69,000 us I
[33:15] grow to couple thousand per month uh the
[33:19] Mr actually I think reach 4K in the
[33:21] month of December 2019 escap room
[33:24] businesses would pay $200 per month to
[33:27] access product the messenger bot and I
[33:29] had a couple like maybe 20 customers at
[33:31] the same time then covid killed the
[33:33] entire business and then I burned out
[33:35] and I abandoned the business completely
[33:37] and he keept making a little bit of
[33:38] money over the years until the last
[33:39] customer turn really recently this
[33:41] business helped me understand the
[33:42] foundation of programming and I built
[33:44] another software later that would cover
[33:47] the most important part of web
[33:48] development one of the main struggle I
[33:50] had with viral bot is that customers
[33:52] would have to share their messenger but
[33:54] with their customers in order to get
[33:56] results and because of that not all
[33:58] escap from businesses were getting good
[33:59] results with the product so I decided to
[34:01] create a new one called game widget
[34:03] which is basically a similar thing so
[34:05] it's a game but instead of being on
[34:07] Facebook Messenger it's on a website so
[34:09] the code is old so it's hard to show you
[34:11] but they used to be a little widget here
[34:13] at the bottom left that people can click
[34:15] and actually play a game and so when
[34:16] they would click here it will open a
[34:18] pop-up window in the center and they
[34:19] will be able to play this game right
[34:21] here and so it's like a mini escape room
[34:23] within a website so people can go across
[34:26] different rooms and then they have some
[34:28] puzzles to solve so here they would use
[34:29] the key to open the safe to get the lamp
[34:32] they could turn on the light here using
[34:33] the lamp get some stuff and once they're
[34:35] done solving all the puzzles they will
[34:37] get a discount coupon for the business
[34:39] so they can book I launched this product
[34:40] for a very wide Market I didn't Target
[34:43] Escape rooms but like basically any
[34:44] business so I really struggle to get
[34:46] customers I think I get about $50 in
[34:49] monthly recurring Revenue the pricing is
[34:51] set to pay per use so it's $19 per 500
[34:55] website visitors which is a little bit
[34:57] price but the commer rates were really
[34:59] good and just like what Co happened and
[35:01] my other software went down I also
[35:02] abandoned this business and didn't touch
[35:04] it the product was making about $50 to
[35:06] $80 per month and so last year I decided
[35:08] to try to sell it and I managed to find
[35:10] a buyer so it was exactly 80 Mr so
[35:13] that's pretty almost nothing and the
[35:15] person bought it for $4.3 th000 which is
[35:18] kind of amazing that was the first
[35:19] startup that got Acquired and I was
[35:21] really happy with that all right that's
[35:22] a wrap if you want to check the text I'm
[35:25] using to build all those products I'll
[35:26] link to a video somewhere right here and
[35:28] if you enjoy the video and would like to
[35:29] subscribe to the channel That would
[35:30] really mean a lot until the next video I
[35:32] hope you just ship it
