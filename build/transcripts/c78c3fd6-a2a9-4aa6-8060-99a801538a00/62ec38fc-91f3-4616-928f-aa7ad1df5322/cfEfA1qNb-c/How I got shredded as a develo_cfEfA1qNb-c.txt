[00:01] [Music]
[00:15] oh man workout always feel like a burden
[00:17] before I start but it feels so good when
[00:20] I'm done okay so some people asked how
[00:22] do I get feet but the truth is I am lazy
[00:26] I've never been to a gym and I don't
[00:28] have time I have nine tiny businesses to
[00:30] run and so I build a little system for
[00:32] myself that requires the minimum input
[00:34] for the maximum output so here are the
[00:37] eight Fitness rules that transfer my
[00:39] body and uh my workout routine is at the
[00:41] end so rule number one I always g a
[00:45] really good night of sleep there is a
[00:47] part of the brain that is responsible
[00:48] for uh self discipline and decision
[00:51] making and that part regenerate during
[00:53] the night I think it's called the preal
[00:55] cortex like some Andrew ubberman thing
[00:58] but I can tell that if I have 6 hours of
[01:00] sleep I'm going to wake up and
[01:02] everything will feel hard I know I have
[01:04] to work out but I'll struggle to find
[01:05] the motivation and it's going to be so
[01:07] easy for me to just ditch that workout
[01:09] session but on the other side if I sleep
[01:11] 8 hours my motivation my self- will
[01:13] power is much stronger and then I never
[01:16] dit the workout and of course there is
[01:17] this like deep sleep thing where you
[01:19] have all the muscle recovering happening
[01:21] during the night so always try to get 8
[01:23] hours of sleep this is super important a
[01:26] good place to get started is to always
[01:28] go to bed at the same time my bedtime is
[01:30] 9:00 p.m. and I never uh change that try
[01:33] to sleep in a room that is a little bit
[01:34] cold have a little wind down routine
[01:36] where you don't look at your phone or
[01:37] you don't think about work before going
[01:39] to bed and avoid having heavy meals
[01:41] before going to bed now the rule number
[01:43] two is to always work out in the morning
[01:45] the reason is because there is like the
[01:46] dopamine system that makes us do things
[01:49] in order to get the reward but now with
[01:51] like social media and and uh sugary food
[01:53] and stuff like that we can easily get
[01:55] dopamine for like the really minimal
[01:57] amount of effort and so that workout
[01:58] feels like it's really hard it's a
[02:00] really hard thing to do but the good
[02:01] thing is that when you work out in the
[02:03] morning your brain is like pure because
[02:05] during the night the the brain restores
[02:08] the dopamine level to like a Bas line
[02:10] it's much easier to find motivation
[02:12] early in the morning and whenever I tell
[02:14] myself I'm going to work out someone in
[02:15] the evening because I don't have time
[02:17] right now I always end up not doing it
[02:19] rule number three is to work out every
[02:21] single day I know it seems hard but the
[02:23] truth is you don't need to go to the gym
[02:25] and spend 2 hours what you want to do is
[02:27] you want to start extremely small you
[02:29] can start with 10 push-ups per day you
[02:31] want to do it every single day early in
[02:33] the morning until you start building an
[02:35] identity of a person who works out every
[02:37] single day there's a really good book
[02:39] about that which is atomic habits and
[02:41] this is how you forge a new personality
[02:43] and now because I build this like habit
[02:45] of working out every day it is
[02:47] impossible for me to not work out I
[02:50] wouldn't say I like workout but I am
[02:51] addicted like this is my new personality
[02:54] and if I don't work out I feel bad which
[02:56] then pushes me to do the workout no
[02:59] matter what and so what I started doing
[03:00] is at first I made the workout very
[03:02] small like super tiny so I couldn't say
[03:04] no because it was like 10 minutes and
[03:06] then I started to add a little bit more
[03:08] workout every day when it became too
[03:09] easy more push-up more chin up more ABS
[03:12] Etc rule number four is to know exactly
[03:14] what you want to get I don't care having
[03:17] a bulky physic I don't care having
[03:19] massive biceps I'm not Alex hormozi this
[03:22] is something I do not care about I know
[03:24] exactly what I want I want to be lean I
[03:26] want to be fit I want to be able to jump
[03:28] I want to be super flexible stretchy
[03:29] this is exactly what I want and that is
[03:32] much easier than having a massive body
[03:35] with massive muscles I have picked a
[03:37] goal that I can achieve relatively
[03:39] easily so that I so that I am always
[03:41] satisfied now the mistake number five is
[03:44] that to push extra hard and I see lots
[03:47] of people making that mistake for me I
[03:49] work out a very minimal amount of time
[03:51] 30 to 40 minutes per day but when I am
[03:54] in these workouts I become a beast like
[03:57] there's nothing else that matters
[03:58] outside there's no f there is no
[04:00] distraction I am 100% into the workout
[04:03] and what I try to do is I always try to
[04:05] have an extra rep I try to beat the
[04:07] teacher that's my new game I try to go
[04:08] faster than them like I am 100%
[04:11] committed into the workout so that in
[04:13] the minimum amount of time I invest for
[04:15] that workout I'll get the maximum output
[04:18] rule number six is to find a workout
[04:21] that feels like a play to you I have
[04:23] been struggling with motivation my whole
[04:25] life it started with school because my
[04:27] teachers were boring then I struggled to
[04:29] find pleasure in the in the workouts
[04:31] still but the cure to that is to play
[04:34] and workout is not my playground surfing
[04:37] is so whenever I can I live in Bal I
[04:39] will go for a surf session and dit the
[04:41] workouts because I do something that I
[04:43] like it is so easy to find the
[04:45] motivation to get started it is so easy
[04:47] to push that extra rep because it feels
[04:49] like a play try to find something you
[04:51] like that could be running that could be
[04:53] climbing there many other activities
[04:55] that you can do rather than just doing
[04:56] workout at home rule number seven is to
[04:58] move more of
[05:00] I used to think that um walking and
[05:02] things like low intensity workouts that
[05:05] doesn't make me sweat are useless I
[05:08] studed to understand kind of understand
[05:10] how the body works like how the food is
[05:12] processed and how it's used to consume
[05:14] energy and just simply walking consumes
[05:17] lot of energy it will basically drain
[05:19] the glucose out of the blood use it as
[05:21] energy and then it will consume the fat
[05:23] in order to find more energy and so just
[05:25] walking will make you leaner they say
[05:28] that everywhere that 10,000 step per day
[05:30] is making you healthy I refuse to
[05:32] believe it for so long and now I Chang
[05:34] my mind so every time after a meal I'll
[05:36] will go on the trend meal at home and I
[05:38] would spend 10 to 15 minutes walking
[05:40] fast making at least 1 kilometer so that
[05:43] I Cross My 10K steps because the problem
[05:45] with my work is that I am working on my
[05:47] computer most of the day and uh actually
[05:51] maybe I should make more YouTube videos
[05:52] because at least I get to stand a little
[05:54] bit rule number eight and the final one
[05:56] is eating the right food it's crazy how
[05:59] much it impacts the body shape the first
[06:01] one the most obvious one is that when
[06:03] you eat protein you grow muscles so for
[06:06] that I eat P protein uh in addition to
[06:08] what I eat on a daily basis to make sure
[06:10] I have enough protein and I try to eat
[06:12] at least 1.5 time my weight in protein
[06:15] so I have around 120 gam of protein per
[06:17] day and the second most important effect
[06:19] on the body is that it burns fat uh I'm
[06:22] not a scientist or a doctor uh but
[06:24] roughly what I understand is that first
[06:26] the body when it needs energy it will
[06:28] use the glucose and then it will burn
[06:30] the fat out of the body so technically
[06:32] if you don't overeat you should lower
[06:33] your body fat what I eat on a daily
[06:35] basis could be an entire video but it's
[06:37] roughly this I eat mostly vegetables
[06:40] like I eat tons of vegetables recently I
[06:42] tried an experiment where I cut down
[06:44] completely carbage Foods so bread pizza
[06:47] pasta grains and stuff like that and
[06:49] that had a dramatic impact on my
[06:52] Cravings I used to be hungry all the
[06:54] time across the day and since I remove
[06:56] that and now I eat really really low
[06:58] carbs I don't have cravings anymore I'm
[07:00] not even hungry I eat two meals per day
[07:02] and I just feel lighter not wanting to
[07:05] eat and of course that impacts my body
[07:07] and I'm lovering my body fat and on top
[07:09] of that I don't eat any sugar whatsoever
[07:11] and I don't drink alcohol I eat a few
[07:13] supplements so I have this like collagen
[07:15] peptide this is not a sponsored video by
[07:17] the way this is just literally my
[07:19] collagen peptide I I eat around 10 gr
[07:21] per day I think I feel like it feels
[07:23] good for the ligaments I have way less
[07:25] pain than I used to I actually I don't
[07:27] have any pain anymore um this really
[07:29] changed my life the supplements from
[07:31] Brian Johnson the blueprint stack as I
[07:33] said I also eat a little extra protein
[07:36] from like protein PE protein powder and
[07:38] creatine around five four to five gr per
[07:41] day which same could be an entire video
[07:43] by itself uh also change my life make my
[07:45] brain feel like better sharper and feels
[07:47] like the Muscle Recovery is way faster
[07:50] okay now this is my workout routine I
[07:52] have a base that is around 10 minutes
[07:54] that I do every single day no matter
[07:55] what that includes 20 uh pullup and
[07:58] chinups each 28 80 push-ups I do 40
[08:01] push-up in a weird position and 40
[08:03] push-ups in another weird position I
[08:04] always try to rotate what kind of uh
[08:06] push-ups I do I do
[08:08] 125 Russian situps and if possible I
[08:12] will use a dumbbell like a 10 kilo
[08:14] dumbbell on top of that and I finish
[08:16] with a 5 minute plank I put on a music
[08:19] that is around 5 minutes and I try to
[08:21] hold as much as I can the numbers are
[08:23] weird like 20 25 85 whatever is because
[08:26] as I said before I am building tiny
[08:28] habits and whenever I reach level where
[08:30] I'm comfortable I try to add an extra
[08:32] rep an extra rep an extra rep until I
[08:34] get comfortable and of course when I
[08:36] started it was much lower than that I
[08:38] couldn't even do five pull-up chin-up
[08:39] and on top of that I have two
[08:40] Alternatives if the waves are good in B
[08:42] I'll will go surf right away but if the
[08:44] waves are crap like they are at the
[08:46] moment and for the past two weeks I
[08:47] would just do a workout at home there
[08:49] are two types of workout I do mostly
[08:51] it's either calisthenic 30 to 40 minutes
[08:53] of like pure body weight slow movements
[08:56] uh very hard on the muscle but slow
[08:58] movements or I'm going to do interval
[09:00] high-intensity interval training for
[09:01] like 30 minutes while push the cardio to
[09:03] the next level and I tried to rotate a
[09:05] calisthenic a hit a calisthenic and a
[09:07] hit and just recently my wife bought
[09:10] some dumbbells and I started like
[09:12] dumbbell workouts like 10 kgam workout I
[09:15] found all my routines on YouTube I watch
[09:17] Caroline g a famous YouTuber's videos
[09:19] and I just follow along and I try to
[09:21] beat her and final part I don't think
[09:24] this one really impact my body shape but
[09:26] it makes me feel good uh I do 15 minutes
[09:28] of stretching for going to bed there is
[09:30] a huge part on Fitness which is about
[09:33] genetics we all have different
[09:35] metabolisms um so those are my results
[09:37] but my wife started to follow the same
[09:39] routine actually I followed my wife
[09:41] routine more than that she's Asian and
[09:43] she's a female so completely different
[09:45] genetics and the results she's had are
[09:46] crazy I'm super proud of her when we met
[09:49] 7 years ago we both had neglected
[09:51] Fitness for a little while and in the
[09:53] past year or so we've taken Health to
[09:55] the next level and the results she's had
[09:57] are absolutely crazy when I look at her
[09:59] back she look like she has like those
[10:01] almost you could climb on top of it um
[10:03] all because we are following these like
[10:05] rules that uh I just mentioned in the
[10:06] video and then I think I made this
[10:09] entire video in one shot right after
[10:11] workout I didn't eat any single food
[10:14] this morning and it's almost 11:00 a.m.
[10:15] so now it's time for the breakfast and
[10:17] the protein
[10:20] shake do that workout today
