[00:00] So, I built this agent in 2 hours, and
[00:01] someone actually paid me $1,200 for it.
[00:03] And it wasn't anything too complex or
[00:05] advanced. In fact, I actually built this
[00:07] back when I had just first started
[00:08] messing around with an end. And
[00:10] honestly, if I was to rebuild this
[00:11] system today, it would probably take me
[00:13] 30 minutes max. What's crazy about that
[00:15] is I'm pretty sure all of you guys could
[00:16] build something just like this. So, in
[00:18] this video, I'm going to walk through
[00:19] what the agent does, why someone paid me
[00:21] for it, what this means for anyone
[00:22] trying to get started, and how I'd sell
[00:24] my first AI agent if I was starting from
[00:26] zero today. So, what was the AI agent
[00:28] that I ended up selling? Well, it's
[00:29] funny because it's actually not an AI
[00:31] agent at all. It's more of an AI
[00:32] workflow, AI system. At this point, AI
[00:34] agent was kind of a buzzword and
[00:36] everyone was calling everything agents,
[00:37] myself included. But more realistically,
[00:39] this was an AI workflow that I sold. So,
[00:41] what did this workflow do? Every single
[00:43] day, it would go off three times in the
[00:44] morning, and it would go through an idea
[00:46] generator AI, which was prompted to
[00:47] think of topics that would appeal to
[00:49] this client's target audience. The end
[00:50] goal was that everything was speaking
[00:52] through his company's branding and his
[00:54] tone of voice to ultimately help nurture
[00:56] and convert the target avatar that his
[00:58] LinkedIn profile is trying to speak to.
[01:00] And you can see here it's a very, very
[01:01] simple system. You guys may even think
[01:03] it's funny how simple this thing looks
[01:04] right now. But at the time, there were
[01:05] some pretty advanced things going on
[01:07] here with like data aggregation,
[01:08] splitting out different items, stuff
[01:10] like that. Making an HTTP request, and
[01:12] then creating content, which was a
[01:14] really hot topic and still is when it
[01:16] came to AI powered systems. And at this
[01:18] point in my life, you know, I was still
[01:19] working full-time and I was just
[01:21] building a lot of stuff with Naden for
[01:22] fun and really just trying to learn what
[01:24] was possible. And that's how I got good
[01:26] at automating so quick because I was
[01:28] just talking to chatbt trying to figure
[01:29] out some cool use cases to build and
[01:31] then I would go ahead and try to build
[01:33] it as best as I could just for myself
[01:34] and to make a YouTube video about it
[01:36] where I build it live, explain what I'm
[01:38] doing because for me explaining
[01:40] something really helps it stick in my
[01:41] brain. So, you guys see that workflow?
[01:43] You know, it's nothing too complex if
[01:44] you've been building with editin for a
[01:45] while. But how did I actually get
[01:47] someone to pay me for it? Well, like I
[01:49] said, I was just posting random things
[01:50] on YouTube, little tutorials, stuff like
[01:52] that. And at this point, it was
[01:53] primarily for learning. I had no call to
[01:55] actions in my YouTube videos, but in all
[01:57] of them, I just had my email right there
[01:59] in the description. And at this point,
[02:00] my videos were getting like 200 views a
[02:02] week. But what I knew were people that
[02:03] were super interested, like genuinely
[02:05] interested in what I was building. And
[02:06] after a while of this, people started
[02:08] reaching out. And this client ended up
[02:10] reaching out because he just wanted to
[02:11] hop on a call and wanted to talk about
[02:13] what was possible. It almost seemed like
[02:14] he was just reaching out to make a
[02:15] friend because I was not an expert. I
[02:18] wasn't positioning myself online as an
[02:20] expert or someone that would sell a
[02:21] service. We ended up just kind of
[02:22] hopping on a phone call and talking and
[02:24] he ended up asking if I wanted to
[02:25] collaborate with him. At this point, I
[02:27] was really excited at the opportunity
[02:28] just to be meeting people that are
[02:30] interested in what I'm interested in,
[02:31] but more so at the opportunity to build
[02:32] something for free for someone and just
[02:34] get some experience working with people
[02:36] and not taking on something that was a
[02:37] whole lot of pressure. but he seemed so
[02:39] excited about it and we were talking a
[02:40] lot about the value that this system
[02:41] would add to him. So I decided I might
[02:43] as well throw out a price tag and just
[02:44] see that you know what his reaction is
[02:46] and he pretty much agreed almost
[02:47] immediately. I guess the takeaway here
[02:48] is putting yourself out there and making
[02:50] content on whatever platform it is is
[02:52] extremely powerful especially if the
[02:54] goal is not to get tons and tons of
[02:55] views and go viral. But the goal is to
[02:57] connect with people who are genuinely
[02:59] interested in exactly what you are
[03:00] genuinely interested in. even if you're
[03:02] not positioning yourself as an expert
[03:04] because that raw genuiness builds trust,
[03:06] that authenticity, and that's what you
[03:08] need to get people to actually want to
[03:09] work with you. Of course, I wasn't the
[03:10] only one building at the time and
[03:12] posting about edit workflows. So, why
[03:14] did this business owner pay me $1,200
[03:16] for a 2-hour job? So, it took me 2
[03:18] hours, which is 600 bucks an hour, which
[03:19] is an insane rate. But the client wasn't
[03:21] paying for the workflow or wasn't paying
[03:23] for me on an hourly basis. He was paying
[03:26] for the outcome. I get so many questions
[03:27] about pricing, and really it's about the
[03:29] value ad. in order to accurately and
[03:31] fairly price something in a way where
[03:33] it's a good deal for you and also a
[03:34] no-brainer for the client is to
[03:36] understand exactly the value that you're
[03:37] adding to this specific client. And in
[03:39] order to understand that value, you need
[03:41] to figure out how do they do this
[03:42] process manually? How much time does it
[03:43] currently take them or their employees?
[03:45] How does that client value an hour of
[03:47] his or her time or an hour of his or her
[03:49] employees time? And then there's also
[03:50] tons of other intangible benefits of AI
[03:53] automation as well. Of course, at the
[03:55] time, I was insanely happy about making
[03:56] a quick $1,200, but if I really started
[03:59] to think about it, the value of this
[04:00] system in my mind was way more than
[04:02] $1,200. The way that the client was
[04:04] manually doing this process was spending
[04:05] hours each week creating and posting
[04:07] this content, which wasn't something he
[04:09] was genuinely passionate about, but it
[04:11] was more so something he knew he needed
[04:13] to do to grow the business. And rather
[04:15] than paying a VA or some employee to do
[04:17] this, which would be an ongoing expense
[04:19] at the time, he was able to get this
[04:21] onetime build with a onetime fee. And
[04:23] now all he has to do is pay for his API
[04:24] credits which are pretty minimal. So
[04:26] this is over a 10x return for the
[04:28] business owner. And I think the main
[04:30] thing to understand here is that if you
[04:31] know how to solve a real problem, even
[04:33] with off-the-shelf AI tools, people will
[04:35] pay. At this point, I've really
[04:36] positioned myself in the NAND market. So
[04:38] people come to me now and are looking
[04:40] for NAND solutions because that's what
[04:41] they're familiar with. But ultimately,
[04:43] people don't care how you fix it. They
[04:45] just care about what you did to fix it
[04:47] and if it actually provides value to
[04:49] them as a business owner. Now, the
[04:51] reason I'm telling you guys about this
[04:52] is I know a lot of you are building but
[04:54] find it hard to believe someone will pay
[04:56] you good money for your agents. Well,
[04:58] this is proof that a lot of people will.
[05:00] What this means for you is that you
[05:01] don't need to be a coder, a genius, an
[05:04] expert. You just need to be accessible
[05:06] to anyone who likes building agents and
[05:08] has a business that they want to grow
[05:09] without increasing headcount. Like in
[05:11] the example I just showed, the business
[05:13] owner reached out to me just to have a
[05:14] casual conversation and then because I
[05:16] was so passionate about it, he just
[05:18] wanted to work on something with me.
[05:20] Now, I'm aware that it's a completely
[05:21] different space today than what it was
[05:23] 8, nine months ago, but you'd be shocked
[05:25] just how early we still are to this
[05:26] whole AI automation wave. There are
[05:28] people who are still just now starting
[05:30] to even use chatbt and understand the
[05:32] value of it. And if you can understand
[05:33] pain points and start stitching together
[05:36] different tools, you're going to become
[05:37] in extremely high demand. There are so
[05:39] many high leverage automations that you
[05:41] can build for small business owners who
[05:43] don't even know that this technology
[05:44] exists. stuff like building some
[05:46] automations for personalized outreach,
[05:47] automations for customer support,
[05:49] automations for personal productivity.
[05:51] The list goes on and on. If you're in
[05:52] this space now, you've probably been
[05:54] aware of the whole website chatbot thing
[05:55] for a while. And it may seem like old
[05:57] news to you, but almost every day I'll
[05:59] be talking to people who are just
[06:00] mind-blown by the fact that you can have
[06:01] a little widget on a website and no
[06:03] longer have to manually answer FAQs or
[06:05] customer support related issues. And if
[06:07] you can help people save time, save
[06:09] money, save their focus so that they can
[06:11] use that time, money, focus to grow
[06:12] their business, you will get paid. Now,
[06:14] I know it might sound like it's super
[06:16] easy because I've already built up a
[06:18] channel, but here's exactly what I'd do
[06:19] if I had to start over from scratch. I
[06:21] would start sharing my journey, whether
[06:23] that's on Medium, LinkedIn, school
[06:25] communities, whatever it is, to start
[06:26] talking about what I'm learning, and
[06:28] people will find it interesting. Then,
[06:29] I'd get really good at not just building
[06:31] automations, but being able to identify
[06:33] people's problems. Like I've said
[06:35] before, you want to make yourself a
[06:36] doctor, not a pharmacist. Someone who
[06:38] can not only fix the problem, but
[06:40] someone who can help you identify what's
[06:42] wrong. A lot of people that I've talked
[06:43] to in this space know that they need to
[06:45] start using AI and they know that they
[06:47] need automations, but they don't know
[06:48] exactly where in their business to look
[06:50] to start implementing it. And that's
[06:52] where you can come in and help them out.
[06:53] Next, I would understand the different
[06:55] tools that I have available to use in
[06:57] order to solve those problems.
[06:58] Obviously, I use any of them for most
[07:00] things, but I think you'd be shocked at
[07:01] how easy it would be to leverage other
[07:03] tools that are out there and prove your
[07:04] expertise in the space. I think just the
[07:06] other week I told someone about
[07:07] Perplexity and how I use it to help me
[07:09] research and find a bunch of good
[07:10] sources. And they were absolutely mind-b
[07:12] blown that they could pay a $20 a month
[07:14] subscription and basically get a
[07:16] software that would replace an intern
[07:18] that would be doing research all day.
[07:19] But of course, the more custom you want
[07:20] to get and especially when you want to
[07:22] build backend automations at scale.
[07:23] Learning something like Nen is a great
[07:25] great place to start. But I know for a
[07:27] fact that there are people out there
[07:28] right now making money just going into
[07:31] businesses and teaching them how to use
[07:33] chatbt. The next thing to think about is
[07:35] get to a prototype fast. You don't need
[07:37] to go from discovery call with client
[07:39] immediately to a perfect productionready
[07:41] system. In fact, the quicker you get to
[07:42] a prototype that fails, you're actually
[07:44] on your way to getting a system that
[07:45] you'd be ready to sell much quicker.
[07:47] Most builders overthink this and get
[07:48] super caught up in that aspect. But
[07:50] typically, when I am working with a
[07:52] client, I tell them straight up at the
[07:53] beginning, hey, I'm really going to need
[07:55] to lean on your subject matter expertise
[07:57] here because ultimately I'm building
[07:58] this system for you. So, I'm going to
[08:00] need a lot of your input to make sure
[08:01] that it fits your needs and that you're
[08:02] happy with it. Not only does that make
[08:04] sense from the business owner's
[08:05] perspective, but they're really going to
[08:06] appreciate that you are thinking through
[08:08] that with them and that's how they can
[08:10] tell that you're really on their team.
[08:11] And when you're building high-quality
[08:12] automations, predictability and patterns
[08:14] are going to be your best friend. And
[08:16] you don't know what you don't know. So
[08:18] when things start to break, which they
[08:19] will and which they should, what you can
[08:21] do is you can start to collect those
[08:23] edge cases and identify patterns and
[08:25] then you can build in certain guard
[08:26] rails to protect against those patterns.
[08:28] So, that's really the best way to make
[08:30] your system actually robust is to put it
[08:32] out there, test it a ton, let it receive
[08:34] some live inputs, and basically just
[08:36] make sure you're watching it and
[08:37] tracking it. You need to see when it
[08:39] breaks, why it broke so that you can
[08:40] actually fix it. And at this point, you
[08:42] should feel very confident doing things
[08:43] and selling some of your solutions for
[08:45] money. But, you need to be able to put
[08:46] an accurate price tag on it in a way
[08:48] that the client feels justified handing
[08:50] you over that check. And like I kind of
[08:52] alluded to earlier, this all comes down
[08:53] to proving the ROI, the return on
[08:56] investment. Business owners typically
[08:57] don't think in terms of how many nodes
[08:59] are on your workflow or how many API
[09:01] calls you're making. They're going to be
[09:02] thinking in terms of if I pay this
[09:04] person x amount of money, how much time
[09:05] are they going to save me? How much
[09:06] money in the long run am I going to make
[09:08] or save because of this person? Will the
[09:10] results be more consistent or higher
[09:12] quality than what I'm currently doing
[09:14] manually? So, every system that you are
[09:16] pitching to build should very clearly
[09:18] show improvement in at least two of
[09:19] those three categories. Ultimately, you
[09:21] want all three to be improvements, which
[09:23] makes it a no-brainer. And just like I
[09:24] talked about earlier with valuebased
[09:26] pricing, let's say you get to the
[09:28] conclusion that this system is going to
[09:29] save the business owner $15,000 a month.
[09:31] It's going to get them back personally
[09:32] over 20 hours a month that they can use
[09:34] to focus on higher leverage tasks. It
[09:36] then becomes almost a no-brainer to say,
[09:37] "Hey, upfront cost of $3,000 a month and
[09:40] then $1,000 a month ongoing." Just to
[09:42] throw out an example. But that is
[09:43] basically an offer that would make the
[09:45] business owner feel dumb for saying no.
[09:46] And that's how you show ROI. So, I don't
[09:48] want this video to go too long and I
[09:50] hope you guys have gotten a lot out of
[09:51] it. I've thrown all of this together in
[09:52] a doc for you guys, so you can save this
[09:54] as a resource. And if you want to access
[09:55] that for free, all you have to do is
[09:57] join my free school community and you'll
[09:58] find it in there. And if you guys want
[10:00] to see more in-depth content on selling
[10:01] AI services without having to start up a
[10:03] full agency or a full AI company or
[10:05] anything like that, let me know. I'd
[10:07] love to bring some more of this type of
[10:08] content to you all because I'm aware
[10:09] that we're all kind of looking to
[10:11] monetize our skills, but not all of us
[10:13] are looking to start up an entire
[10:14] business. So, if you enjoyed the video
[10:16] or you learned something new, please
[10:17] give it a like. It definitely helps me
[10:18] out a ton. And as always, I appreciate
[10:20] you guys making it to the end of the
[10:21] video. I'll see you on the next one.
