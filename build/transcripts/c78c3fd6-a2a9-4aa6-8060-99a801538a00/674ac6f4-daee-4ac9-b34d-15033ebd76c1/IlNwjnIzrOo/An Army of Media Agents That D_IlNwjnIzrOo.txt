[00:00] I just built this ultimate media agent
[00:01] that can do anything. Okay, so we talked
[00:03] to our agent through Telegram and on
[00:04] this lefth hand side you can see I'm
[00:06] going to send over an image and what the
[00:07] agent's going to do is first of all
[00:09] process this into our Google Drive
[00:10] environment. So here you can see the
[00:12] agent's pretty eager to help us out.
[00:13] It's asking us about how we want to name
[00:15] this and also if we want to change any
[00:17] sharing settings. So here you can see I
[00:19] just sent off this message that says to
[00:20] just name it speaker. What it's going to
[00:22] do is it's going to go to our Google
[00:23] Drive agent right here and that is the
[00:25] one that has the right tools to actually
[00:27] change the name. As you can see, this
[00:28] tool right here is called change name.
[00:29] Okay, so it just responded to us and of
[00:31] course it's logging all of its actions,
[00:32] which I'll show you guys later. But if I
[00:34] pull back up Telegram, it says that it
[00:35] renamed the file to speaker. I can click
[00:37] on this link right here and we should
[00:39] see that exact picture that I just
[00:40] uploaded. And you can see it exists in
[00:42] our folder called media. It is called
[00:43] speaker and it's right here. So now what
[00:45] I'm going to do is send off this other
[00:46] message that says, "Please edit that
[00:48] image. Turn it into a studio looking
[00:50] image. It should be energetic, colorful,
[00:52] and highlight the feeling of listening
[00:53] to music on a speaker." Whatever that
[00:55] means. the media team will figure it
[00:57] out. As you can see, just as we
[00:58] predicted, the creative agent is using
[01:00] its edit image tool. So, I'll check back
[01:02] in with you guys once we get that final
[01:04] product back. All right, look at that.
[01:05] The agent actually ended up creating
[01:07] three different images for us. So, we
[01:08] have a couple different styles that we
[01:10] can choose from, which is pretty cool.
[01:11] All right, so just fired off this new
[01:12] message where I said, "Actually, what I
[01:14] want you to do is take that first
[01:15] preview file." So, this was the one that
[01:17] we liked the best. And then I said,
[01:19] "Turn that into a video. create a VFX ad
[01:22] with music and lights that sync to the
[01:24] beat as an advertisement for a JBL
[01:26] speaker. Real quick, wanted to update
[01:27] you guys. The creative agent has full
[01:28] autonomy to use its tools to help us out
[01:30] with our media. And you can see it's
[01:32] going to turn that image into a video,
[01:33] but it also wanted to try out creating
[01:35] its own video with just text. So, I'm
[01:37] not too confident how good this one will
[01:39] be, but we'll definitely take a look.
[01:41] All right, so that just finished up. I'm
[01:43] very, very impressed. So, this first one
[01:45] is the one that was actually the image
[01:47] turned into video. So, let's click into
[01:48] this real quick. We'll hear the audio.
[01:58] If you want to see how you can set up
[01:59] this exact system for free, then click
[02:01] on that play button right here to watch
[02:02] the full video. And I'll see you guys
[02:03] over there.
