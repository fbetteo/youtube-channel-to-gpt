[00:00] Here's how you can easily connect voice
[00:01] to your NAD workflows in minutes. So,
[00:03] we're going to head back over to 11 Labs
[00:05] real quick. And what we're going to do
[00:06] is on this left-hand side, we are going
[00:08] to go to agents. So, up in the top left,
[00:11] you're going to click on these arrows
[00:12] and you're going to choose
[00:13] conversational AI. And now we can set up
[00:15] a voice agent. So, I'm going to click on
[00:17] agents and we're going to create a new
[00:19] one, which I'm just going to start from
[00:20] a blank agent. So, right here is where
[00:22] you could choose the language. You could
[00:23] also go in here and choose the voice.
[00:25] We're just going to leave it as default
[00:26] for now. And then we can set up
[00:28] something like a first message. Here's
[00:30] where you could customize letting your
[00:31] agent end the call. We can have it
[00:33] transferred to a different agent,
[00:34] transfer to a number, all this kind of
[00:36] stuff. What we're looking to do is add a
[00:38] custom tool, which will let us send data
[00:40] to n. And then nadn can send data back
[00:42] to our agent. And now we have to go get
[00:44] our naden web hook URL to send data to.
[00:47] So we'll go back into n. We're going to
[00:49] add a web hook. And right now we are
[00:52] basically just going to grab this URL
[00:54] right here. But we also have to make
[00:55] sure that this is changed to post since
[00:57] that we have it set up as in 11 labs.
