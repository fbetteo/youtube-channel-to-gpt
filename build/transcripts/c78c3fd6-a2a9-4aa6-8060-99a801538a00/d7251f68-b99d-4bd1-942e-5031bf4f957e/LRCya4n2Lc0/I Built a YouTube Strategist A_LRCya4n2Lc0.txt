[00:00] I just built a full YouTube strategist
[00:01] in NN with no code. So right here you
[00:03] can see I put in Nick Serve,
[00:05] RoboNuggets, and Simon Scrapes. I'm
[00:07] going to hit submit and then we're going
[00:08] to watch this first phase kick off. And
[00:10] right now what it's going to do is it's
[00:11] going to take all three of those
[00:12] channels. It's going to go look at their
[00:14] outliers, so their best performing
[00:16] videos over the past 6 months. It's
[00:18] going to grab those top 10 and then
[00:19] analyze their titles and their
[00:21] thumbnails. And then we're going to get
[00:22] all of that data for us in a Google
[00:24] sheet. All right, there we go. Just
[00:25] finished up and we're writing back to
[00:26] Google Sheets. So, I'm going to hop over
[00:28] to that tab and we'll take a look. So,
[00:29] as you can see, the first channel we
[00:30] looked at was Nick Surv. And we can see
[00:32] that we have his 10 best performing
[00:34] videos from the past 6 months. And the
[00:36] data that we get about each of these
[00:38] videos is the title, the URL, the
[00:40] thumbnail, the views, the likes, and
[00:42] then here's where our AI analysis comes
[00:43] into play. So, what we have that first
[00:45] AI agent do is look at the title and
[00:47] pull out the power words that were used
[00:49] in the title. But basically, you can see
[00:50] it's pulling out certain words that are
[00:52] grabbing attention or making some sort
[00:53] of promise. Like right here we have full
[00:55] course 6 hours build and sell AI
[00:57] automations. So the idea of this first
[00:59] sheet is that you can go ahead and look
[01:00] at other channels in your niche that are
[01:02] doing well. You can look at their best
[01:04] performing videos and you can see
[01:05] different things in their titles,
[01:07] different patterns that are probably
[01:08] leading to their videos performing well.
[01:09] And then you can start to think how can
[01:11] I make titles with my niche and my
[01:12] content that work into these patterns.
[01:14] And then the second part of the
[01:15] packaging is the thumbnail analysis. So
[01:17] right here we can see this first one is
[01:19] this thumbnail grabs attention because
[01:20] it has bold text that says full a
[01:22] automation course. And then we can go
[01:24] ahead and click into this link right
[01:25] here and it will pull up the actual
[01:26] thumbnail that was used for the video.
