[00:00] If you want to run nodn locally for
[00:02] free, watch this video. Okay, so step
[00:04] one is click on the link in the
[00:05] description and we're going to go to the
[00:06] self-hosted AI starter kit, which is a
[00:08] GitHub repository. So once we run this
[00:10] self-hosted starter kit, we're going to
[00:12] have nadn, quadrant, and postgress. So
[00:15] it gives us good building blocks to
[00:17] start building agents and workflows. So
[00:19] before we actually install it, there's
[00:20] one prerequisite, which is go to
[00:22] docker.com and you're going to have to
[00:23] download docker desktop. Hit download
[00:26] docker desktop and then obviously make
[00:27] the download for your system. Okay, once
[00:30] you've got that downloaded, let's go
[00:31] back over to the self-hosted starter kit
[00:32] and we'll come down here to
[00:33] installation. And all we're going to do
[00:35] is find which commands we need to run.
[00:37] So for me, I've got a PC with Nvidia
[00:39] GPU. So I'm going to use this one. If
[00:41] you've got AMD GPU on Linux or if you
[00:43] got Mac, then you'll use these ones down
[00:45] here. But all I'm going to do is hit
[00:46] copy on these three little lines right
[00:48] here. I'm going to open up my terminal
[00:50] and I'm going to run this as an
[00:52] administrator. Now that I'm in here, I'm
[00:54] just going to paste in what we copied
[00:55] from the self-hosted starter kit. It's
[00:57] going to run that first one, which is
[00:58] basically just cloning that GitHub
[01:00] repository. So, it just cloned the
[01:02] self-hosted starter kit. Now, we're just
[01:04] going to actually spin it up. So, right
[01:05] here, I'm just going to click enter. And
[01:06] what this is going to do is it's going
[01:08] to pull in six things. It's going to
[01:09] pull in n import nama, Postgress, and
[01:13] Quadrant. And right here is where we
[01:15] could get to that port. If I clicked
[01:16] onto this, it would open up in our
[01:18] browser localhost 5678. You guys can't
[01:20] see it, but my URL up here says
[01:22] localhost 5678. And now, it just needs
[01:25] us to set up our account. If you want to
[01:27] watch the full tutorial, click that play
[01:28] button right here.
