[00:00] I just built a marketing team with only
[00:01] one AI agent. So, as you can see, this
[00:03] agent has access to these six tools. It
[00:05] can create videos, LinkedIn and blog
[00:07] posts, create images, edit those images,
[00:10] and also search through its image
[00:11] database. Create an image for a flyer
[00:14] for cat food. And there's a flash sale.
[00:17] Okay, so we just sent that off. You can
[00:18] see it's transcribing that audio,
[00:20] hitting the marketing team agent, and
[00:21] it's going to hit its create image tool.
[00:23] And right now, that workflow is
[00:24] processing, and I'll check back in a sec
[00:26] when we get that image. Okay, looks like
[00:28] it just finished up. As you can see, we
[00:29] just got our message. Here's your flyer
[00:31] image for cat food with flash sale.
[00:33] Anyways, let's have it make that a
[00:35] little more realistic. So, can you edit
[00:37] that image and make it more realistic?
[00:39] Send that off. It's going to use its
[00:41] image database to grab the actual image
[00:42] to edit. And now, it's going to go edit
[00:44] that. And I'll check back in when we get
[00:46] that edited image. As you can see, now
[00:48] we have the updated, more realistic
[00:49] flyer. It's a very realistic looking
[00:51] orange cat eating cat food. And there's
[00:52] a flash sale. And we can also see that
[00:54] if we go to our marketing team log, we
[00:56] have the new picture right here, and
[00:57] it's a type edit. We have the prompt and
[01:00] then we also have the link for our
[01:01] Google Drive with the new image.
