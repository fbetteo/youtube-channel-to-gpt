[00:00] this is how to set up your Google
[00:01] credentials in under 5 minutes so that
[00:02] you can connect to any Google app in
[00:04] nadn let's go all right we're going to
[00:06] start with Google Drive you'll click
[00:07] into here you want to go to create new
[00:09] credential and then you can click open
[00:11] docs right here as you can see we need
[00:12] to use a client ID and a client secret
[00:14] so we're going to open docs because we
[00:15] need to set up a Google Cloud account
[00:17] right here we can see a prerequisite
[00:19] create a Google Cloud account we'll
[00:20] click into here and we need to set this
[00:22] up from here you need to set up a
[00:23] project so I've already got one called
[00:25] my first project but we're going to
[00:26] create a new one all you have to do is
[00:27] name it real quick we'll call this one
[00:29] demo and and then we can click create
[00:31] once that project has been created
[00:32] you'll click on select project so we can
[00:34] get in there and make that ooth and the
[00:36] client ID now make sure up here you've
[00:37] selected the right project then we can
[00:39] go into the navigation menu and click on
[00:41] apis and services and we're going to go
[00:43] down to ooth consent screen once we're
[00:45] in here we're going to click create
[00:46] we're basically just setting up that NN
[00:48] has permission to access stuff within
[00:49] our Google environment so we're going to
[00:51] name this one I'm going to call this one
[00:52] demo you need to add a support email so
[00:54] add an email there and then you can fill
[00:56] out more information but you don't need
[00:57] to just another email right here and
[01:00] then we'll hit save and continue from
[01:01] here we have different Scopes that you
[01:02] can set up for now I'm just going to
[01:03] click continue and then we want to add
[01:05] our test users or we can just publish
[01:07] the app so in the test users you want to
[01:09] add an email that will be able to get
[01:11] through that will have permission to
[01:12] access this emails um Google Drive
[01:15] Google Docs email stuff like that so
[01:17] we'll click add and then we're going to
[01:19] hit save and continue once again and
[01:20] this is pretty much all we need to do
[01:22] we've set up our oath consent screen we
[01:24] have ourselves here as a test user and
[01:26] now we need to set up our credentials so
[01:27] on the left hand side once again right
[01:29] above ooth send screen click on
[01:30] credentials as you can see right now we
[01:32] have no API Keys No oo client IDs and no
[01:35] service accounts so we're going to click
[01:36] create credential and we're going to go
[01:37] to ooth client ID within here we're
[01:40] going to set up a web application and
[01:42] you can name it anything you want once
[01:43] again we'll call this one demo and then
[01:45] we need to add the authorized redirect
[01:47] URI so back in NN we can see the ooth
[01:50] redirect we're going to click on this to
[01:52] copy it go back into our cloud and then
[01:54] we're going to paste that URI down here
[01:56] so now we're good to go we're going to
[01:57] click create now that we've done that a
[01:59] screen will pop up with with our client
[02:00] ID and our client secret so we're going
[02:01] to copy the ID paste the ID in there go
[02:05] back to Cloud copy the secret paste the
[02:08] secret in there and then we'll be
[02:09] prompted to sign in with Google click on
[02:11] this button it's going to pull up a
[02:13] screen over here where you're just going
[02:14] to choose the account you want to choose
[02:15] the one that you have yourself as a test
[02:17] user you'll hit over here continue we
[02:19] want to give it access to all of our
[02:20] information all of our drives and then
[02:23] we should be good to go because you'll
[02:24] see the account connected you'll see it
[02:25] go green and that's all we have to do to
[02:27] set up this credential back in Cloud if
[02:30] you close out of that screen you can
[02:31] still get to your client ID in secret
[02:32] you'll click on the name of that ID and
[02:34] now you have your client ID here and
[02:35] your secret here to copy in case you
[02:37] need to set up another credential so we
[02:39] have that credential connected but we're
[02:40] not fully done yet because you can see
[02:42] there's no information coming back so
[02:43] we're going to go back into Cloud we
[02:45] need to go to enabled apis and services
[02:47] and now we need to enable the certain
[02:48] things that we want to access in naden
[02:51] so if I come in here and type in Google
[02:53] Drive we will grab the Google Drive API
[02:56] and then all we have to do is click on
[02:58] enable so this will go go green it will
[03:00] say that we've already enabled it and
[03:02] then we can hop back into NN and we
[03:03] should see our information so this just
[03:05] loaded through we now have the status as
[03:07] enabled go back into nadn and we might
[03:10] have to refresh this but now you can see
[03:12] we have the information from my Google
[03:13] Drive showing up so the hard part is
[03:15] really done now we just need to do the
[03:16] same thing for Gmail and docs but it's
[03:18] much easier now so we'll come in here
[03:20] click create new credential and all you
[03:21] have to do is sign in with Google so
[03:23] you're going to do the same exact thing
[03:24] where you click on sign in with Google
[03:25] you choose the account that you have
[03:26] yourself as a test user um you're going
[03:29] to enable all the permissions once again
[03:31] hit continue and then it will
[03:33] go and then it will go green there we go
[03:35] I was about to say what just happened
[03:37] and once again this wouldn't work yet
[03:38] because we need to go into um Cloud we
[03:40] need to go to enabled apis and services
[03:43] and then we need to get Gmail API and
[03:45] it's the exact same step we just have to
[03:46] hit enable and then once that status is
[03:49] enabled we'll be good to go on nadn side
[03:51] of things there we go now we can come in
[03:53] here we could fill out what we want and
[03:55] we'd be able to send an email then
[03:56] finally same exact thing for docs sheets
[03:58] anything else you want to use you'll
[04:00] connect to that new credential you're
[04:01] just going to add your ID your secret
[04:04] and you already have this information
[04:05] set up it'll prompt you to sign in and
[04:07] then finally all you need to do is go
[04:08] back into Cloud you'll grab Google Docs
[04:12] um Google Docs API right here and same
[04:14] thing you'll hit enable and then you'll
[04:16] be good to go you'll be able to access
[04:17] your documents and there you have it
[04:19] super simple super easy I know it seems
[04:21] intimidating at first but now that
[04:22] you've got that stuff set up you're good
[04:23] to go you'll do the exact same thing for
[04:25] different Google nodes you know if you
[04:27] come in here and you want to grab a
[04:28] sheets or you want to grab gra slides
[04:30] all you have to do once again is go into
[04:31] cloud and then enable that API in your
[04:34] console thanks for watching guys if you
