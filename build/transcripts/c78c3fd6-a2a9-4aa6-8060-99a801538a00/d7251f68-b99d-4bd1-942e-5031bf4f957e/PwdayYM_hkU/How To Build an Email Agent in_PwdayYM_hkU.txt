[00:00] this is how to build an email agent in
[00:01] nadn with zero code in under a minute so
[00:03] once you're in nadn you're going to hit
[00:04] tab you're going to type in AI agent and
[00:06] grab your agent and then all we have to
[00:07] do is plug in a chat model which is its
[00:09] brain so we'll click on this plus we'll
[00:10] click on open AI for this case and we
[00:12] have our account set up and we have GPD
[00:14] 4 mini as the brain then we're going to
[00:15] click on the plus for Tool I'm going to
[00:17] type in Gmail and we're going to grab
[00:18] this Gmail node and it's going to be a
[00:20] send message then all we have to do is
[00:21] Click these three buttons let the model
[00:23] Define this parameter so we'll click
[00:24] this for two we'll click this for
[00:25] subject and we'll click that for your
[00:26] message as well finally the last step is
[00:28] we just want to rename this tool so the
[00:29] agent knows what it does so we'll say
[00:31] send email and we're already done all we
[00:33] have to do now is test it out so I said
[00:34] send an email to Nate example.com
[00:36] letting him know that I'm running late
[00:37] to the meeting and they can start
[00:38] without me and before I could even
[00:40] finish reading that off the email has
[00:41] already been sent so here we have the
[00:42] email it was sent to Ned example.com the
[00:45] subject is running late to meeting and
[00:46] the message says hi Nate I just wanted
[00:47] to let you know that I'm running late to
[00:49] the meeting please feel free to start
[00:50] without me thanks your name and now all
[00:51] we have to do to fix this is tell the
[00:53] agent how to sign off the email so we'll
[00:54] click into the send email tool and under
[00:56] message we'll add a description that
[00:57] says sign off as Bob so now we can come
[00:59] back out we can send this message once
[01:00] again and it's going to do the exact
[01:01] same thing but this time we'll get a
[01:03] sign off as Bob it's already done here
[01:04] you can see we have another email it's
[01:06] sent to Nat example.com and it signs off
[01:08] as Bob if you want to learn more about
