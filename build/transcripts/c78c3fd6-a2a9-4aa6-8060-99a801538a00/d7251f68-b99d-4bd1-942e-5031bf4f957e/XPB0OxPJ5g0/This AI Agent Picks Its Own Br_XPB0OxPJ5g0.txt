[00:00] If you've ever wondered which AI model
[00:01] to use for your agents and you're tired
[00:03] of wasting credits or overpaying for
[00:05] basic tasks, then this video is for you
[00:07] because today I'm going to be showing
[00:08] you a system where the AI agent picks
[00:09] its brain dynamically based on the task.
[00:12] This is not only going to save you
[00:13] money, but it's going to boost
[00:14] performance and we're also getting full
[00:16] visibility into the models that it's
[00:18] choosing based on the input and we'll
[00:20] see the output. As you can see, we're
[00:21] talking to this agent in Slack. So, what
[00:23] I'm going to do is say, "Hey, tell me a
[00:24] joke." You can see my failed attempts
[00:26] over there and it's going to get this
[00:27] message. As you can see, it's picking a
[00:29] model and then it's going to answer us
[00:31] in Slack as well as log the output. So,
[00:33] we can see we just got the response, why
[00:34] don't scientists trust atoms because
[00:36] they make up everything. And if I go to
[00:38] our model log, we can see we just got
[00:39] the input, we got the output, and then
[00:41] we got the model which was chosen, which
[00:43] in this case was Google Gemini's 2.0
[00:45] flash. All right, let's try something
[00:46] else. I'm going to ask it to create a
[00:48] calendar event at 1 p.m. today for
[00:50] lunch. Once this workflow fires off,
[00:52] it's going to choose the model. As you
[00:53] can see, it's sending that over to the
[00:55] dynamic agent to create that calendar
[00:57] event. It's going to log that output and
[00:58] then send us a message in Slack. We
[01:00] click into the calendar real quick.
[01:02] There is our launch event at 1. And if
[01:03] we go to our log, we can see that this
[01:05] time it used OpenAI's GBT 4.1 Mini. All
[01:08] right, we'll just do one more and then
[01:10] we'll break it down. So, I'm going to
[01:11] ask it to do some research on AI voice
[01:13] agents and create a blog post. Here we
[01:15] go. It chose a model. It's going to hit
[01:16] Tavi to do some web research. It's going
[01:19] to create us a blog post, log the
[01:21] output, and send it to us in Slack. So,
[01:23] I'll check in when that's done. All
[01:24] right, so it just finished up, and as
[01:26] you can see, it called the Tavly tool
[01:28] four times. So, it did some in-depth
[01:29] research. It logged the output, and we
[01:31] just got our blog back in Slack, as you
[01:33] can see. And if you're wondering what
[01:34] model it used for this task, let's go
[01:36] look at our log. We can see that it
[01:37] ended up using Claude 3.7 Sonnet. If you
