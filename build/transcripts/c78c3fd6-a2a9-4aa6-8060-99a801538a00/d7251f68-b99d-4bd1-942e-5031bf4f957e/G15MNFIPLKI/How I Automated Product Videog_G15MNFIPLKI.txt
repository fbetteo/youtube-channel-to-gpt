[00:00] I just automated product videography
[00:02] with no code. Okay. So, all I have to do
[00:03] in this form submission is enter in a
[00:05] picture of a product, enter in the
[00:07] product name, the product description,
[00:09] and my email address. And we'll send
[00:10] this off, and we'll see the workflow
[00:12] over here start to fire off. So, after
[00:14] our image has been generated, we're
[00:15] uploading it to a API to get a public
[00:17] URL so we can feed that URL of the image
[00:20] into Runway to generate a professional
[00:22] video. So, anyways, it just finished up.
[00:25] It ended up hitting this check eight
[00:26] times, which indicates I should probably
[00:28] increase the wait time over here. But
[00:29] anyways, let's go look at our finished
[00:31] products. So, we just got this new
[00:32] email. Here are the requested marketing
[00:34] materials for your toothpaste. So, first
[00:36] let's look at the video cuz I think
[00:37] that's more exciting. So, let me open up
[00:38] this
[00:39] link. Wow, we got a 10-second video.
[00:42] It's spinning. It's 3D. The lighting is
[00:44] changing. This looks awesome. And then,
[00:46] of course, it also sends us that image
[00:48] in case we want to use that as well. And
[00:50] one of the steps in the workflow is that
[00:51] it's going to upload your original image
[00:52] to your Google Drive. So, here you can
[00:54] see this was the original and then this
[00:55] was the finished product.
