[00:00] Watch me build a rag AI agent in
[00:01] minutes. So, like I told you guys, what
[00:03] we're going to be putting in our vector
[00:04] database today is this PDF that's in my
[00:06] Google Drive called the rules of golf
[00:08] simplified. And it is a 22page PDF. So,
[00:11] in order for us to access that PDF, we
[00:13] are going to have to connect to Google
[00:15] Drive and end it in. So, what I'm going
[00:16] to do real quick is hit tab. I'm going
[00:18] to type in Google Drive. I misspelled
[00:20] Google a little bit. Click on that. And
[00:22] then I'm going to open up the actions,
[00:24] which is going to be download file. All
[00:26] we're going to do is look through our
[00:27] list of different documents in our
[00:29] account. And now I'm going to be able to
[00:31] pull in this PDF. I'm going to click on
[00:33] this plus button after the Google Drive.
[00:35] So I'm going to click on Superbase
[00:36] Vector Store. I'm going to click on add
[00:38] documents to vector store. And now that
[00:40] we've connected here, we just have to do
[00:41] two more things. We have to chunk and
[00:44] then embed so that we can actually
[00:45] vectorize. So what I'm going to do is
[00:47] hit tab and I'm going to type in AI
[00:49] agent and grab that agent right there.
[00:51] Now we need to connect a brain to our AI
[00:53] agent. So, if I click on the plus under
[00:55] chat model. I'm going to scroll down
[00:56] here and grab OpenAI chat model. And now
[00:58] we just need to choose a model to use.
[00:59] I'm going to stick with GPT 4.1 mini.
[01:01] And the final step is just to give it a
[01:03] tool so that it can actually look in
[01:04] this vector database. So, I'm just going
[01:06] to say what am I allowed to do for
[01:07] practice? Let's see if the agent
[01:09] understands that we're talking about
[01:10] golf and that it needs to use the
[01:12] Subbase vector store, which it did. And
[01:14] now it's going to take that information
[01:16] and return an answer to us. And then
[01:18] we'll basically validate if it is
[01:19] correct or not. cannot practice on the
[01:21] course the day of stroke play tournament
[01:22] or before playoff on the course. And
[01:24] also during the round, you cannot hit a
[01:26] practice shot while playing a hole or
[01:29] between holes. If we go over to the PDF,
[01:30] you can see that's pretty much exactly
[01:32] word for word what we were looking for.
[01:33] If you want to watch the full breakdown,
[01:34] click on that play button right here.
