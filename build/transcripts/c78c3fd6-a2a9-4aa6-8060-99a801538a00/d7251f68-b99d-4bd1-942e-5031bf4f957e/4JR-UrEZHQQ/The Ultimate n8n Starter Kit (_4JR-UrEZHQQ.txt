[00:00] hey guys today I'm really excited to
[00:01] share something that I've been working
[00:02] on for a while now the ultimate NN
[00:04] starter kit if you've been wanting to
[00:05] learn about AI automation or you've been
[00:07] hearing a lot about AI agents and you
[00:08] want to build them yourself or maybe
[00:10] you're even considering switching over
[00:11] from something like make or zapier then
[00:13] this is your sign this starter kit is
[00:15] pretty much an all-in-one resource
[00:17] that's packed with everything you need
[00:18] to know to master your naden from the
[00:20] basics of workflow automation to
[00:21] building some really cool powerful AI
[00:24] agentic systems for those of you that
[00:25] don't know me I'm Nate I've been
[00:27] building AI agents and AI automations in
[00:29] nadn for a while now and over these past
[00:31] months I've learned a lot from
[00:32] experimenting so I wanted to compile
[00:34] some of this information into the
[00:35] starter kit so that you can progress
[00:37] faster than I did and not hit some of
[00:39] those same roadblocks that I did so as
[00:40] you can see there are five main modules
[00:42] here and if we expand this first one you
[00:43] see it's going to start pretty much at
[00:45] the beginning intro to nadn and then
[00:47] every lesson and every module is going
[00:48] to build on top of itself so we've got
[00:50] resources that are going to be tagged in
[00:52] every section of every lesson so that
[00:54] you can click into more information but
[00:56] the goal here is just to give you a good
[00:57] road map on your journey into nadn like
[00:59] I said as we get into different modules
[01:01] we're going to have more resources
[01:02] there's going to be video tutorials to
[01:03] watch there's going to be documentation
[01:05] to look at there's going to be some case
[01:06] study stuff like that um so you're
[01:08] really going to be able to get
[01:09] everything you need in this all-in-one
[01:11] resource if you want to get your hands
[01:12] on this document you can download it for
[01:13] free in my free school Community Link
[01:15] for that will be down in the description
[01:17] this Resource as well as all the other
[01:18] videos I've created on YouTube and all
[01:20] of the templates you can also download
[01:21] for free in my community um really going
[01:24] to help you progress a lot faster than I
[01:25] did with nadn and building AI agents so
[01:28] as you can see these next modules are
[01:29] talking about building and managing
[01:30] workflows more resources more videos to
[01:32] take a look at um we're going to recap
[01:34] each module then we move into
[01:36] introducing AI agents same thing more
[01:38] resources more stuff to look at and then
[01:40] the last one is sort of advanced AI
[01:42] Integrations and you guessed it there's
[01:44] going to be more resources in here as
[01:45] well so it's not going to be just the
[01:46] starter kit that's going to help you
[01:47] succeed it's also going to be the free
[01:48] community that you're going to join in
[01:50] order to access the starter kit right
[01:51] now we've got just over 6,000 members in
[01:53] this community and it's growing super
[01:54] fast and everyone joined the community
[01:56] because they want to take their skills
[01:57] with AI Automation and specifically na
[02:00] farther so we're sharing resources in
[02:02] there we're talking about creative ways
[02:04] to solve problems and um you're going to
[02:06] get a lot of your questions answered
[02:07] with nadn in here rather than trying to
[02:09] Google and troubleshoot on your own I've
[02:11] also heard a lot of stories about people
[02:12] within the community collaborating with
[02:13] each other to work on products together
[02:15] um become partners and start up a
[02:17] business together so there's some really
[02:18] cool opportunities in here with
[02:19] like-minded individuals so this is what
