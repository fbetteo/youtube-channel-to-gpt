[00:00] Here's how you can scrape any website
[00:01] with Firecrawl and Nadin. So, Firecrawl
[00:03] is going to allow us to turn any website
[00:05] into LLM ready data in a matter of
[00:07] seconds. And as you can see right here,
[00:08] it's also open source. As you can see,
[00:10] there's four different things we can do
[00:12] with Firecrawl. We can scrape, we can
[00:14] crawl, we can map, or we can do this new
[00:16] extract, which basically means we can
[00:18] give Firecrawl a URL and also a prompt
[00:20] like can you please extract the company
[00:22] name and the services they offer and an
[00:24] icebreaker out of this URL. So, we've
[00:26] got some information here. The first
[00:28] thing to look at is when we're using the
[00:29] extract, you can extract structured data
[00:31] from one or multiple URLs including wild
[00:34] cards. And if you put a asterk after it,
[00:36] it's going to basically mean this is a
[00:37] wild card and it's going to go scrape
[00:39] all pages that are after it rather than
[00:41] just scraping this one predefined page.
[00:44] As you can see right here, it'll
[00:45] automatically crawl and parse all the
[00:47] URLs it can discover, then extract the
[00:49] requested data. So, real quick before we
[00:51] test this out, I'm just going to call
[00:52] this extract. And then we'll hit test
[00:54] step. And we should see that it's going
[00:56] to be pulling and it's going to give us
[00:57] a message that says um true and it gives
[01:00] us an ID. And so now what we need to do
[01:02] next is pull this ID back to see if our
[01:05] request has been fulfilled yet. So now
[01:06] after 5 seconds had passed or however
[01:08] much time we would try this again. And
[01:10] now we can see that we have our item
[01:12] back and the data field is no longer
[01:13] empty because we have our quotes object
[01:15] which has 83 quotes. So it even got more
[01:18] than that time we did it in the
[01:20] playground. If you want to watch the
[01:21] full breakdown, the link for that will
[01:22] be down in the description.
