[00:00] If you're tired of setting up manual
[00:01] HTTP requests, then this is the video
[00:02] for you because today I'm going to show
[00:04] you guys how to connect to community
[00:05] nodes. Whether you are hosted on Naden
[00:08] cloud, self-hosted in the cloud, or
[00:09] locally hosted. And a community node is
[00:12] just a node that a member of the
[00:13] community has built because it solves a
[00:15] specific problem or adds more
[00:16] functionality that Naden doesn't
[00:18] natively have. So, let's get into it.
[00:20] All right, so here is an article that
[00:21] Naden released last week that says
[00:23] community nodes are now available on
[00:24] Naden cloud, which is great because
[00:26] previously you had to be self-hosting
[00:28] the community version of NAND if you
[00:30] wanted to use these nodes. And as you
[00:31] can see down here, they're starting with
[00:33] just 25 nodes that are some of the most
[00:34] used community-built packages and
[00:36] partner supported integrations. And
[00:38] they're going to be expanding the
[00:40] library gradually, bringing on more
[00:41] verified nodes so that we can connect to
[00:43] pretty much anything a lot easier. Now,
[00:45] they talk a little bit more about why
[00:46] they're investing in the ecosystem.
[00:48] community nodes have been extremely
[00:49] successful over the past couple months
[00:50] and then it's going to spotlight a few
[00:52] of the community nodes that will be
[00:53] available on cloud like tavly pdfge
[00:56] browser flow we've got 11 labs we've got
[00:58] ser api so let's get into our end cloud
[01:01] and check it out one thing to note at
[01:03] the top of the article is that it says
[01:04] you must be on version 1.94 or later so
[01:06] if I go into my noden and I click on my
[01:09] admin panel in the bottom left down here
[01:11] we can see that I'm currently running
[01:13] 1.94.1 so I'm good but what we have to
[01:15] do is click on settings and we have to
[01:17] go down here to verify community nodes
[01:19] and turn that on. And then we have to
[01:21] hit save changes. So this is going to
[01:22] basically restart our workspace. So make
[01:24] sure you have your workflow saved and
[01:25] everything. And if I go back to my
[01:27] dashboard, it's going to say that it's
[01:28] basically spinning it back up. It's
[01:30] making the changes right now. And then
[01:32] once it is green, we'll be able to click
[01:34] open and we'll launch back into our
[01:36] Naden environment. All right, so we're
[01:38] green. I'm going to go ahead and open up
[01:39] my workspace. And now that I'm back in
[01:41] my environment, what we can do is go
[01:42] down here to settings. And we'll see we
[01:44] have a new option down here that says
[01:45] community nodes, which would not have
[01:46] been there before. And it says you can
[01:48] install community and partner built node
[01:50] packages that have been verified by NAN
[01:52] directly from the panel. So rather than
[01:54] having to come here to install it like
[01:55] you would if you were self-hosting the
[01:57] community edition, you can just do it
[01:59] straight from the panel. So let's hop
[02:00] into a workflow and take a look. All
[02:01] right, so here we are in a workflow. And
[02:03] what I have done is I've connected to
[02:05] Tavi using an HTTP request. And if you
[02:08] guys have been watching my channel for a
[02:09] while, you've probably seen me connect
[02:10] to Tavi a ton. It basically lets your
[02:12] agents search the web with real-time
[02:13] articles, that kind of stuff. And what
[02:15] we had to do inside this HTTP request is
[02:17] we had to go to Tavi. We had to go to
[02:19] the API documentation and we had to set
[02:21] up all this stuff with all these
[02:22] different parameters. As you can see, we
[02:23] put in all this information. We have our
[02:25] parameters and what we asked was what is
[02:27] AI automation? And then here we get our
[02:29] actual answer. And then over here, we
[02:30] get a result with an actual URL. But
[02:33] what we're able to do now with the
[02:34] community nodes is if I move this nasty
[02:36] HTTP request out of the way and I click
[02:38] on the plus. If I search for Tavi, we
[02:40] can see right here that we have a Tavi
[02:42] community node. And if I hover over the
[02:44] check mark, it says this is an official
[02:45] node maintained by Tavi. So I'll click
[02:48] on that. And what we have to do is
[02:49] install it. So I'm just going to click
[02:50] install node. This is going to take like
[02:52] 10 seconds. It doesn't take long at all.
[02:54] Now you can see that we have it
[02:55] installed. If I go into the actual
[02:57] community nodes of our cloud, you can
[02:58] see that this is the one that we have.
[03:00] This is where you could go ahead and
[03:00] look at documentation or uninstall this
[03:02] package. But now that we have it
[03:04] installed, what we can do is we can use
[03:05] that search endpoint, which is exactly
[03:07] the one that I used back in this
[03:09] previous HTTP request right up here. And
[03:11] so now it's pretty cool. We have a
[03:12] native node that has the little Tavi
[03:14] logo and everything. And all I have to
[03:15] do in here is I have to put in a
[03:16] credential and a search query. And then
[03:19] we have the option to add all these
[03:20] other things that we had in the actual
[03:22] request right here. But we don't have to
[03:23] deal with the actual body parameter.
[03:25] Let's say we wanted to um you know do a
[03:28] different topic. we have the option of
[03:29] general, news or finance. Or let's say
[03:31] we wanted to do max results. We can just
[03:34] put in a number and it's way more easy
[03:36] to look at. So first thing I do is I'd
[03:38] want to create a credential. So I'd
[03:39] click on create a credential and all I
[03:41] have to do is plug in my API key. So
[03:42] I'll go to Tavi and I'll just copy this
[03:44] key right here. Hit save and we'll be
[03:46] good to go there. And then I just need
[03:47] to type in a search term. So I'm just
[03:49] going to type in what is AI automation
[03:51] just so we can see the same thing as
[03:53] what we did earlier. And now we're
[03:55] running it. It is a community node as
[03:57] you can see. You can see we get back
[03:58] this result. We don't have an answer
[04:00] probably because we did different
[04:01] results, but we have five different URLs
[04:03] and they're all going to tell us about
[04:04] what AI automation is. And what's really
[04:06] nice about these community nodes is a
[04:08] lot of times I see people have issues
[04:09] with the authentication because with
[04:11] Tavi specifically in your
[04:13] authentication, you have to put in
[04:15] bearer space API key. But as you guys
[04:17] saw in this native node, when you create
[04:19] your credential, all you have to do is
[04:20] give your API key. So whoever built this
[04:22] community node is handling all of that
[04:24] kind of stuff on the back end. Okay.
[04:26] Okay, so let's look at one more real
[04:27] quick. If I go come down here and let's
[04:29] try the 11 Labs. So you can see interact
[04:31] with 11 Labs API. What we have to do, of
[04:33] course, is install it. All right, there
[04:35] we go. So we just installed the 11 Labs
[04:37] API. And now let's see what I want to do
[04:39] is let's do convert text to speech. So
[04:41] as you can see, everything's already
[04:42] configured. We just have to put in a few
[04:44] things. So what I'm going to do first is
[04:45] my credential. So all I had to do was
[04:47] paste in my 11 Labs API key. I didn't
[04:48] have to mess with bearer space or X-API-
[04:52] or anything like that. I just threw in
[04:53] my API key and now we're good to go. And
[04:55] what I can do is choose from a list of
[04:57] voices rather than just having to go and
[04:59] get like a voice ID. So we can see I
[05:00] have Nate Herk, I have Jarvis, I have
[05:02] Archer, I have all this kind of stuff.
[05:03] Let's do one with Rachel and then the
[05:06] actual text for 11 Labs to turn into
[05:08] speech. So here we're going to have
[05:09] Rachel say community nodes. Wow. We'll
[05:11] run this and we'll see what we got. All
[05:13] right. I just downloaded the file that I
[05:14] got from 11 Labs. Let's hear it.
[05:16] Community nodes. Wow. Okay. So that's
[05:18] just to prove that we actually were able
[05:20] to access 11 Labs API server. And
[05:22] another thing I wanted to mention is
[05:24] just because it's a community node
[05:25] doesn't mean that you can't have
[05:26] triggers or agent tools as well. So for
[05:29] example, if I click on the plus under
[05:30] our AI agent, what we can see is that if
[05:32] I want to do the Tavi again, but this
[05:34] time use it as a tool. We see right here
[05:36] we have our community tool which is part
[05:38] of that Tavly package, which of course
[05:40] was this one that we just used down
[05:42] here. This is the official Tavly one.
[05:44] And then this is the tool that is part
[05:45] of that package. And so of course I
[05:47] could click under there and I could add
[05:48] it to the workflow. And now we have our
[05:50] Tavly tool that we can hook up to our AI
[05:52] agent. And we already have our
[05:54] credentials saved because we just set it
[05:56] up with this package. And then when it
[05:58] comes to triggers, you basically would
[05:59] just have to play around to see if the
[06:00] community node that you're trying to use
[06:02] has a trigger. So if I came into this
[06:03] workflow and I just typed in trigger, we
[06:05] can see we have a ton of different
[06:06] triggers. Um, looks like this one right
[06:07] here, Swift Gum, is one of the official
[06:09] ones that is a community node. I also
[06:11] noticed earlier that we had one called
[06:13] chat data, which lets you take action in
[06:15] chat data, but also it can be used as a
[06:17] trigger down here. So, they've got it
[06:19] all. Okay. So, now we're in my
[06:21] self-hosted version of Niten and I'm
[06:23] going to do the same thing. Go down to
[06:24] settings and click on community nodes.
[06:26] And like I said, now it's a little
[06:28] different because we can install
[06:29] community nodes straight from here. And
[06:31] it's super super simple. All you do is
[06:32] click on install. And then you could
[06:33] just basically type in the name that you
[06:35] need of the package or you could come
[06:37] here and click on browse and you could
[06:39] look at all these other naden community
[06:40] node packages. And I'll also include a
[06:42] link to this GitHub repo in the
[06:44] description, which is the top 100
[06:46] community nodes. And it has different
[06:48] categories like communication and
[06:49] messaging, document and content
[06:51] generation, browser automation, data
[06:53] processing, API and cloud integrations,
[06:55] this kind of stuff. What I'm going to do
[06:56] is because we did an example with
[06:58] Tableau earlier, I'm just going to use
[07:00] that exact one that we used, but this
[07:02] time in a self-hosted environment. So I
[07:03] would come here, I could click on this,
[07:05] which would take us to the mpm site for
[07:08] this actual community node. And it's
[07:10] really easy. All I'm going to have to do
[07:11] is go here and copy that. Go back into
[07:14] Naden, paste that in there, hit the
[07:16] check mark, and then click install. And
[07:18] so now we have our Tavi node installed.
[07:21] I can go back out of here and open up a
[07:22] new workflow. And so now in this new
[07:25] workflow, if I come in here and I type
[07:26] in Tavi, you can see that we're going to
[07:28] have two. So the first one is the
[07:30] verified one from NAN that's maintained
[07:32] by Tavi, which is the one that we just
[07:34] saw an example of. We could come in here
[07:35] and we could install it. Or we can see
[07:37] that we have this other one that we just
[07:38] installed. in this little block means
[07:40] that it is a community node from a
[07:41] package that we installed ourselves. And
[07:43] we could click in here and we could do
[07:44] the exact same thing where we could
[07:46] either search or extract. And then the
[07:48] only difference would be if you were
[07:49] running Nadin locally, you couldn't just
[07:51] come here to your settings and go to
[07:53] community nodes and install one by
[07:55] typing in the name because you need to
[07:57] install the actual node package
[07:58] somewhere that your local ended can
[08:00] access. So according to Naden's
[08:02] documentation, what you need to do is if
[08:04] you want to manually install the
[08:05] community node using npm, you will have
[08:07] to access your docker shell, which is
[08:10] you just get into your nitn environment,
[08:12] create a directory for naden nodes if it
[08:14] doesn't already exist. Otherwise, just
[08:16] navigate to it. And then you just have
[08:17] to run the npm install command and it
[08:19] will already be there. So according to
[08:21] the tavly node that we just looked at,
[08:22] you would basically just have to run
[08:23] this command and all of the other nodes
[08:25] will have the mpm command right there.
[08:27] And then of course you can go look at
[08:28] the GitHub repo for this community node
[08:30] if you need some more information. And
[08:32] then when you restart n it should be
[08:34] there when you type into the node panel
[08:35] for that node you're looking for. All
[08:37] right, so that is going to do it for
[08:38] this one. Hope you guys enjoyed and hope
[08:40] you get in there and play around with
[08:41] some community nodes, see the value in
[08:43] that. If you guys want to see a video on
[08:44] some automations using different
[08:46] community nodes or some of the most
[08:47] useful ones, let me know. I'd love to
[08:49] throw that together for you. Anyways, as
[08:51] always, I appreciate you guys making it
[08:52] to the end of the video and I'll see you
[08:53] in the next one. Thanks everyone.
