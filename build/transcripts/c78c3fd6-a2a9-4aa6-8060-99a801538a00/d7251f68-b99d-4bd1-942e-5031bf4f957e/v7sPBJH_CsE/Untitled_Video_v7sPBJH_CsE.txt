[00:00] this is what every single person is
[00:01] doing wrong when they're building AI
[00:02] agents AI agents are great and there's
[00:04] definitely a time and a place for them
[00:06] because they have different tools and
[00:07] basically the agent will use its brain
[00:08] to understand okay I have these three
[00:10] tools based on what the user is asking
[00:12] me do I call this one and then do I
[00:14] output or do I call this one than this
[00:16] one or do I need to call all three
[00:18] simultaneously it has that option and it
[00:20] has the variability there so this is
[00:22] going to be a non-deterministic workflow
[00:24] but the reality is most of the processes
[00:26] that we're trying to enhance for our
[00:27] clients are pretty deterministic
[00:29] workflows that we can build out with
[00:31] something more linear where we still
[00:32] have the same tools we're still using AI
[00:35] but we have everything going step one
[00:36] step two step three step four step five
[00:38] step six which is going to reduce the
[00:41] variability there it's going to be very
[00:42] deterministic and it's going to help us
[00:44] with a lot of things but real quick
[00:45] let's talk about the pros of AI
[00:47] workflows over AI agents and I narrowed
[00:48] it down to four main points the first
[00:51] one is reliability and consistency one
[00:53] of the most important concepts of
[00:54] building an effective AI agent is the
[00:56] system prompt because it has to
[00:57] understand what its tools are when to
[00:59] use each one and what the end goal is
[01:01] and it's on its own to figure out which
[01:02] ones do I use in order to provide that
[01:04] output but with a workflow we're
[01:05] basically keeping it on track and
[01:07] there's no way that the process can sort
[01:08] of deviate from the guard rails that
[01:10] we've set up because it has to happen in
[01:12] order and it can't really go anywhere
[01:14] else so the next one is going to be cost
[01:16] efficiency when we're using an agent and
[01:18] it has different tools every time it
[01:20] hits a tool it's going to go back to its
[01:22] brain it's going to rerun through its
[01:23] system prompt and it's going to think
[01:24] about what is my next step here and
[01:26] every time you're accessing that AI
[01:28] agent's brain it costs you money
[01:30] so if we're able to eliminate that
[01:32] aspect of decision- making and just say
[01:33] okay you you finished step two now you
[01:35] have to go on to step three there's no
[01:37] decision to be made we don't have to
[01:39] make that extra API call to think about
[01:41] what comes next and we're saving money
[01:43] number three is easier debugging and
[01:45] maintenance when we have an AI workflow
[01:47] we can see exactly which node errors we
[01:49] can see exactly what mappings are
[01:50] incorrect and what happened here whereas
[01:53] with an AI agent workflow it's a little
[01:54] bit tougher because there's a lot of
[01:56] manipulating the system prompt and
[01:57] messing with different tool
[01:58] configurations like I said there's data
[02:01] flowing between agent to Tool or between
[02:03] agent to sub workflow and that's where a
[02:04] lot of things can happen that you don't
[02:06] really have full visibility into and
[02:08] then the final one is scalability kind
[02:09] of backpacks right off of number three
[02:11] but if you wanted to add more nodes and
[02:13] more functionality to a workflow it's as
[02:15] simple as you know plugging in a few
[02:16] more blocks here and there or adding on
[02:18] to the back but when you want to
[02:19] increase the functionality of an AI
[02:21] agent you're probably going to have to
[02:22] give it more tools and when you give it
[02:23] more tools you're going to have to
[02:25] refine and add more lines to the system
[02:28] prompt which could work great in
[02:30] but then previous functionality the
[02:32] first couple tools you added those might
[02:33] stop working or those may become less
[02:35] consistent if you want to see the full
[02:37] video the link for that will be in the
[02:38] description I'll see you guys over there
