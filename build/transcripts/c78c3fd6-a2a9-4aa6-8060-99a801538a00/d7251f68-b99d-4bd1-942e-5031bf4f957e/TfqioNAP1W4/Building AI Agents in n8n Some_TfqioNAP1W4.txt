[00:00] nnn has done it again they've somehow
[00:01] found a way to make building AI agents
[00:03] even easier so whether you've been
[00:04] building agents for a while now or this
[00:06] is going to be your first time taking a
[00:07] stab at it what we're going to look at
[00:09] today is how you can get one spun up in
[00:10] minutes and completely understand what's
[00:12] going on and start to add more tools and
[00:14] more functionality super easily so don't
[00:16] want to waste any time here we're
[00:17] already in nadn I'm going to hit tab
[00:19] type in AI agent and we're going to grab
[00:21] one and bring it into our workflow so
[00:23] the first thing to recognize is that
[00:24] we're chatting with our agent in nadn
[00:26] that's why there's a chat trigger right
[00:27] here and if we click on this red chat P
[00:29] at the bottom we can see this is where
[00:30] we actually talk to the agent next what
[00:32] we want to do is add a brain for the
[00:33] agent so I'm going to click on the chat
[00:34] model the plus button right here click
[00:36] on open AI chat model and I've already
[00:37] got my credentials connected so I'm good
[00:39] to go with chat gbt 40 mini as the brain
[00:42] for our agent and so now we're already
[00:43] able to talk to it I can come in here
[00:44] and I can say hello and it will respond
[00:46] hey how's it going today and then we'll
[00:48] just quickly take a look at what
[00:49] actually goes on in the agent all we're
[00:51] getting is the prompt user message so
[00:53] every time that we talk to the agent
[00:55] down here in this little window the
[00:57] agent right here as you can see because
[00:59] we're searching for a prompt within the
[01:01] connected chat trigger node this is what
[01:03] it's getting which is we just said hello
[01:05] and then we can see on the right the
[01:06] output which is what it said back to us
[01:08] was hello how can I assist you today now
[01:10] that we have our agent up and running
[01:11] all we have to do is add tools and this
[01:12] is where it gets super super easy so I'm
[01:14] going to click on the plus under tool
[01:16] and then on the right we have all these
[01:17] nodes as tool options and I made a video
[01:19] about this a week or so ago talking
[01:21] about how easy it is to connect these
[01:22] things using the from AI function but
[01:24] what I'm going to show you guys today is
[01:25] even easier than using from AI so when
[01:27] you think of an AI agent and you start
[01:28] to think about functionality the first
[01:30] thing you may think of is being able to
[01:31] send emails so I'm going to grab a Gmail
[01:33] tool right here if I can type it
[01:34] correctly we're going to grab Gmail and
[01:36] then we can see what we're going to do
[01:37] is set up our Resource as a message and
[01:39] we're going to be sending a message by
[01:41] the way if this is your first time
[01:42] you're going to have to connect your
[01:43] Gmail using a credential um I'll tag a
[01:45] video right up here where I talk about
[01:46] how to do that anyways when you want to
[01:47] send an email you have to basically fill
[01:49] out three things who's this going to
[01:51] what's going to be the subject and then
[01:53] what is going to be the actual body
[01:54] content message of the email also the
[01:56] email type which we're going to change
[01:57] in this case from HTML to text and
[01:59] anyways in that previous video when I
[02:01] talked about from AI we'd have to go
[02:02] into the two parameter click on
[02:04] expression type in two curly braces grab
[02:06] from Ai and then we'd have to define a
[02:08] key and then we'd have to describe that
[02:09] key so that the model knows what it's
[02:11] looking for to fill in this parameter
[02:13] and if that doesn't make sense to you
[02:14] yet don't worry it will but I'm just
[02:16] going to keep breaking this down real
[02:17] quick so now we don't have to do from AI
[02:19] anymore we can simply just click on this
[02:21] button over here that says let the model
[02:22] Define this parameter so all I have to
[02:24] do is click on this button click on this
[02:26] button and click on this button and now
[02:28] when we're talking to the agent it's
[02:29] going to use its brain it's a large
[02:31] language model to understand who to send
[02:33] it to what to make the subject and then
[02:35] what to fill in as the message you can
[02:37] see that we also have the ability to add
[02:38] a description to one of these Keys which
[02:40] I'll show an example of later but this
[02:41] just says explaining to the llm how it
[02:43] should generate this value a good
[02:45] specific description allows the llm to
[02:46] produce expected results much more often
[02:49] anyways I just changed the name of this
[02:50] node to send email so that the agent
[02:52] understands what it does and what I'm
[02:53] going to show you guys that we have no
[02:54] system message in here typically the
[02:56] system message is like the instructions
[02:57] for the agent and in this case all we
[02:59] saying is the default you're a helpful
[03:01] assistant and the reason I'm not
[03:02] changing this is just to show you guys
[03:03] how intelligent these agents are when
[03:05] you start to add tools like I said this
[03:06] took me a minute and it's already going
[03:07] to be able to send emails for us
[03:08] intelligently so let's get in here and
[03:10] try out a prompt so as you can see I
[03:12] said send an email to Nate herk asking
[03:13] him if he wants to go to a baseball game
[03:15] this weekend we'll send that off we'll
[03:16] see the agent think about it using its
[03:18] brain and now it's already sent that
[03:19] email before I could even finish reading
[03:20] that off so it said the email has been
[03:22] sent to Nate asking if he wants to go to
[03:24] a baseball game this weekend we can
[03:25] click into this node to understand what
[03:27] just happened so because I told you guys
[03:29] that it's using its brain to figure out
[03:31] the two the subject and the message you
[03:33] can see in the top left it filled out
[03:35] these parameters with the email with the
[03:37] subject and then also with an actual
[03:38] body message so let's hop into Gmail and
[03:40] take a look at this so here's the email
[03:42] we can see the subject is baseball game
[03:43] this weekend and the message says hey
[03:44] Nate hope you're doing well I was
[03:46] wondering if you want to go to a
[03:47] baseball game this weekend let me know
[03:48] if you're interested best your name so
[03:50] obviously we don't want the email to be
[03:52] signing off like this every time and we
[03:53] want to also get rid of this automatic
[03:55] message so back in Ed end all I'm going
[03:57] to do is add a description to this
[03:58] message field and I'm going to say sign
[04:01] off emails as Nate from ABC Corp so that
[04:07] should take care of the actual sign off
[04:09] and then I'm going to add an option down
[04:10] here click on append nadn attribution
[04:13] and then flick this off now all I'm
[04:14] going to do is come down here to the
[04:16] chat window hit repost message and it's
[04:18] going to do the exact same thing but
[04:19] this time we'll see that the email
[04:20] doesn't sign off with a placeholder and
[04:22] the message is gone so it looks like it
[04:24] already took care of that I'm back in my
[04:25] email now we have the message baseball
[04:26] game this weekend hope you're doing well
[04:28] wanted to see if you're interested in
[04:29] going to a baseball game and then you
[04:30] can see best Nate from ABC Corp and then
[04:32] there's no um this message was
[04:34] automatically sent by naden so just to
[04:37] put it into perspective of what's going
[04:38] on behind the scenes of that send email
[04:39] tool all we're doing is we're asking
[04:41] chat gbt 40 because that's the chat
[04:43] model we chose to extract the certain
[04:46] parameters out of our query so let's
[04:48] take a look at this example extract the
[04:49] event start time end time attendees and
[04:51] title I'll send this off it says um
[04:54] create an hourong meeting for 4:17 p.m.
[04:56] to go over the corporate retreat with
[04:59] Kelly and so here's the details that the
[05:01] AI model was able to extract event title
[05:03] start time end time and attendees so
[05:06] this is all that's going on within those
[05:07] tools and it's just filling in the
[05:08] details in the right spot in order to
[05:10] make that request to calendar email
[05:12] whatever you're interacting with so
[05:14] let's hop back into NN and do an example
[05:16] of creating a calendar event just like
[05:17] this real quick just wanted to say if
[05:18] you're looking for a more Hands-On
[05:20] approach to learning nadn and building
[05:21] AI agents then definitely check out the
[05:22] paid Community Link for that's down in
[05:24] the description we've got a great
[05:25] community of members who are dedicated
[05:26] to learning NN we've also got a great
[05:28] classroom section with deep dive to
[05:29] topics like building agents Vector
[05:31] databases apis HTTP requests and then
[05:33] I'm doing step-by-step builds of all the
[05:35] YouTube videos that I've shown on my
[05:36] channel we've also got five live calls
[05:38] per week but anyways let's get back to
[05:40] the video all right so now we're going
[05:41] to do a calendar example so I'm going to
[05:42] move this one over hit plus under tool
[05:44] and I'm just going to search for
[05:45] calendar and we're going to be creating
[05:46] a calendar event in our Google Calendar
[05:49] so clicked into the tool all we have to
[05:51] do is create a event so that's already
[05:53] set up um we have to choose the calendar
[05:54] to actually put this on so I'm just
[05:56] going to choose my emails calendar and
[05:58] then once again all we have to do is
[05:59] Click this button click this button so
[06:01] now the model is automatically going to
[06:02] be determining the start and end times
[06:04] and then we can add properties down here
[06:06] so we want to add attendees and we also
[06:08] want to add a summary which is just
[06:09] going to be the title of the event and
[06:11] then once again we just have to click
[06:12] that button and click that button and
[06:13] now the last step here is we just want
[06:14] to name the node so the agent knows how
[06:16] to use it and this is just going to be
[06:17] called create event and now in the chat
[06:20] window what I want to say is create an
[06:21] hourong meeting for 4:17 p.m. tomorrow
[06:23] to go over the corporate retreat with
[06:25] Kelly and Ryan just like we did in that
[06:26] chat TBT example except for right now
[06:28] the agent doesn't know what today is so
[06:30] it doesn't know what tomorrow is so real
[06:32] quick I'm going to show you guys how we
[06:33] can do that and give the agent access to
[06:35] the current date and time we're going to
[06:36] do this within the system message so I'm
[06:38] going to change this to an expression
[06:39] I'm going to open up this up full screen
[06:41] so we can see and I'm just going to say
[06:43] here is the current date time and then
[06:46] we're going to do two curly braces I'm
[06:48] going to type dollar sign now and then
[06:49] it's going to go green meaning it's an
[06:51] expression on the right you can see that
[06:52] we actually have the date and time and
[06:53] if we just want to clean it up so it
[06:55] looks better for us I'm going to do
[06:56] format and then we have a nice clean
[06:58] date on the right anyways now we're
[07:00] going to send this off and we're going
[07:01] to see that it's going to be able to use
[07:02] its create event tool to actually make
[07:03] that event for us it's going to fill in
[07:05] those parameters like start time end
[07:07] time summary and who it's inviting and
[07:09] as you can see it just responded to us
[07:10] with the meeting details and we can also
[07:12] click on that link and what's really
[07:14] cool is that it also sent an email
[07:15] notification to both Kelly and Ryan
[07:17] letting them know of this meeting and we
[07:18] didn't even ask it to do so so first
[07:20] looking at my calendar here's today if
[07:22] we go to tomorrow we can see that we
[07:23] have our corporate retreat discussion
[07:25] from 417 to 517 and then looking in the
[07:27] emails we can see that we sent one to
[07:29] Kelly with the information for the
[07:30] meeting for tomorrow and then it also
[07:32] sent one to Ryan and obviously these are
[07:33] fake emails so it didn't really get sent
[07:35] but you get the point and we can see
[07:37] exactly what happened in here so within
[07:38] the create event tool we can see it
[07:40] created a start time end time attendees
[07:42] and also a summary and then if we click
[07:44] into the send email tool we could see
[07:46] that there were two runs so we have run
[07:47] one out of two and run two out of two
[07:49] and on the left hand side they changed
[07:51] so the first run if we go to this was
[07:53] sending to Kelly and the second run was
[07:55] sending to Ryan okay so that was cool
[07:56] and all and we spun that up in a few
[07:58] minutes but what if we actually wanted
[07:59] be able to send a real contacts in a
[08:01] database let's connect that up so here I
[08:03] am in aor table we can see that we have
[08:05] a contacts base contact table and we
[08:07] have these different contacts here so
[08:08] what I'm going to do now is go back into
[08:10] nadn I'm going to click on ADD tool and
[08:12] I'm just going to be adding an air table
[08:13] tool because that's where my contact
[08:14] database is stored and I'm just going to
[08:16] click on search I'm going to choose the
[08:18] base and the table that I'm looking for
[08:21] which is called contacts and I'm just
[08:22] going to say return all and we're going
[08:23] to change this node to get contacts and
[08:27] then all I want to do here is quickly
[08:28] just let the agent know that it needs to
[08:30] get contact information before it sends
[08:31] emails or creates events so all I said
[08:33] in here was before creating events or
[08:35] sending emails get contact information
[08:37] from the get contact tool so this should
[08:39] work and we should be able to do that
[08:40] exact same thing but now it's going to
[08:42] be looking at contact information so now
[08:43] I'm saying create a meeting for tonight
[08:45] at 7: PM with Michael Scott I'm going to
[08:46] fire that off as you can see it just
[08:48] went and got Michael Scott's information
[08:49] from the contact tool and now it created
[08:51] the event so we have the event created
[08:53] here's a little summary so as you can
[08:54] see it just responded it said that it
[08:56] was able to do that for us but if we go
[08:57] into calendar even though we asked it to
[08:59] create the this at 7:00 p.m. it created
[09:01] it at 5:00 p.m. because it doesn't
[09:02] really know time zone right now and that
[09:04] only is because it's using local time as
[09:06] you can see so the way we need to fix
[09:08] this is we go into the system prompt and
[09:09] we just have to get rid of this format
[09:11] because when we do format it it gets rid
[09:13] of the time but now over here we have
[09:15] the actual time of where I am right now
[09:17] so all I'm going to do is send this off
[09:19] once again and we're going to see it's
[09:20] going to do the exact same process but
[09:22] now it's going to create that calendar
[09:23] event at the correct time so it's
[09:25] finishing up right now we'll see it post
[09:26] a message down in this window there we
[09:28] go we have our event created and now if
[09:30] I go back into the calendar we can see
[09:31] that we have an event created for 700
[09:33] p.m. which is correct but you guys are
[09:35] also always asking for Outlook
[09:36] integration so I just wanted to show you
[09:37] it's the exact same thing we have
[09:39] Outlook send email Outlook create event
[09:41] and all we have to do is the exact same
[09:42] thing where we click on these three
[09:43] buttons now the two the subject and the
[09:45] message are automatically being filled
[09:47] in by the model as well as the title of
[09:49] the event start time of the event and
[09:51] the end of the event so I'm going to
[09:52] send in this other query now that's
[09:53] saying create a meeting for tonight at
[09:55] 7:00 p.m. with Michael Scott and send
[09:56] him an email to confirm and we should
[09:58] see it hitting both the send email tool
[10:00] as well as the create event tool there
[10:01] we go and now let's go take a look in
[10:03] our Outlook so here we are on Outlook
[10:04] you can see we have our meeting at 700
[10:05] p.m. with Michael Scott and then if we
[10:07] go into our sent messages we have to
[10:09] Michael at dundermifflin.com hi Michael
[10:11] this is to confirm our meeting scheduled
[10:12] for tonight at 7:00 p.m. but one
[10:14] difference I want to point out with
[10:15] Outlook and Google Calendar integration
[10:17] is that we don't have the ability to add
[10:19] attendees natively in this node to um a
[10:21] calendar event we would just have to
[10:23] access an HTTP request where we're
[10:25] accessing outlooks API in order to
[10:27] actually add people to these events but
[10:29] but unfortunately that's not what we're
[10:30] talking about today in this video so
[10:31] let's keep going so if you're still not
[10:32] impressed with how intelligent this
[10:33] agent's being already with a 40 Mini
[10:35] model let's go in here and grab a slack
[10:37] tool so what we're going to do is we're
[10:39] going to name this one send slack
[10:42] message we're going to choose the um
[10:44] Channel we want to send in and then
[10:46] we're going to let the AI decide the
[10:47] channel as well as let the AI decide the
[10:49] actual text of the message and so in
[10:51] slack there's multiple channels we have
[10:53] all up at AI social and YouTube testing
[10:55] and what's going to happen is we're
[10:56] going to let the AI decide what channel
[10:57] to send in based on our message so I'm
[10:59] saying send a slack message to social
[11:01] reminding everyone to log off early
[11:02] today so we should see this one hitting
[11:04] the send slack message tool as it did
[11:06] there we go the message has been sent
[11:07] let's go into slack click into the
[11:09] social Channel and we see hey everyone
[11:10] just a quick reminder to log off early
[11:12] today enjoy your evening but now what
[11:13] about a channel like all up at AI where
[11:15] there's spaces in there and then they
[11:16] have to be filled in by hyphens what I'm
[11:18] saying here is send a slack message to
[11:20] the all up at AI Channel asking if the
[11:21] Wi-Fi is down for anyone else is it can
[11:23] hit the slack message tool it's already
[11:24] been sent let's head over to slack and
[11:27] we'll see within up at AI Channel we
[11:29] have is the Wi-Fi down for anyone else
[11:31] so back in N end what's happening in
[11:32] here is the model is able to figure out
[11:34] the channel as you can see it populated
[11:36] it with all-up it- a and it's because it
[11:39] knows that a channel and slack if
[11:41] there's spaces it's going to have to
[11:42] have hyphens in there but let's say you
[11:44] have 10 or 15 channels and you don't
[11:46] want your agent to get confused this is
[11:47] a perfect use case of when you would
[11:49] start to add descriptions in here and
[11:50] you could say you know here are all 15
[11:52] slack channels I have and you could list
[11:54] them out and then it's knowing it has to
[11:56] pick from one of these 15 and then it's
[11:58] always going to be sort of popular
[11:59] correctly so really this was just a
[12:01] simple demonstration to show you how
[12:02] easy it is to get something like this
[12:03] spun up um you know we could we could
[12:05] easily add an air table tool we could
[12:08] want to um add a record so we'll do
[12:10] create record within our contact base So
[12:12] within our contact base we have name
[12:13] email and phone number I can just click
[12:15] on these three buttons and now it's
[12:16] going to intelligently be able to
[12:18] understand how to add a contact using
[12:20] this tool so I'm saying add JN to my
[12:22] contacts here's his number here's his
[12:24] email the number isn't formatted
[12:25] correctly as you can see and it has been
[12:27] added to the contact database
[12:29] we come in here we can see we have John
[12:31] John and example.com with his phone
[12:32] number already structured so as you just
[12:34] saw live that took me probably 10
[12:36] seconds to add this tool and it's
[12:37] already working and just a reminder we
[12:39] have nothing in the prompt besides you
