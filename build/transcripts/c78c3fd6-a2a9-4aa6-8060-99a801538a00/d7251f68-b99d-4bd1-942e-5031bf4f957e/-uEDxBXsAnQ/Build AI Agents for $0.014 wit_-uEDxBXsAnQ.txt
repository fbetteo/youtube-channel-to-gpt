[00:00] today we're going to be walking through
[00:01] how to use deep seek V3 in n8n for a
[00:03] fraction of what it costs to use
[00:05] something like gbt 40 or clae 35 Sonet
[00:08] but real quick what is deep seek V3 it's
[00:10] an open source model that was recently
[00:11] released and it pretty much outperforms
[00:13] every other open source model out there
[00:15] and it also performs pretty comparable
[00:16] to the leading closed Source models like
[00:19] GPT 40 now I'm not an expert on models
[00:21] and fine-tuning and training and all
[00:23] that kind of stuff but I've got a couple
[00:24] Graphics that I'll walk through here and
[00:25] I'll also include the link to the
[00:27] technical report in the description if
[00:28] you guys want to check it out for
[00:29] yourself so as you can see right here in
[00:31] the blue We've Got Deep seek and then
[00:33] we've got other models like llama GPT
[00:35] and Claw 35 and it's pretty much
[00:37] outperforming all of them in these six
[00:39] metrics but why did I decide to make
[00:41] this video and why did you probably
[00:42] click on it because of the price so as
[00:44] you can see here in the green we've got
[00:46] 0014 per a million tokens so you can
[00:48] just throw something like $2 in there
[00:50] and it's going to get you a really
[00:51] really long way here's another graphic
[00:53] from that report that I was talking
[00:55] about this is the needle in the Hast
[00:56] stack test um as you can see the whole
[00:58] board is green so perfect 10 out of 10
[01:00] score across everything this basically
[01:02] tells us that deep seek V3 is really
[01:04] really good with its context length and
[01:07] understanding everything that's going
[01:08] through and not missing out any
[01:10] information the way that some other
[01:11] models might so something really
[01:13] interesting about deep seek V3 is that
[01:15] it uses a mixture of experts model
[01:17] rather than having one model across all
[01:19] the parameters this one has sub models
[01:21] that it can sort of send out based on
[01:24] expertise in certain areas um which is
[01:26] pretty cool once again it's not
[01:28] something I fully understand as far as
[01:29] all the technicalities go check out that
[01:31] report if you want to read more about it
[01:33] but um you know this isn't me
[01:34] recommending that it's better or
[01:35] recommending that you should use it and
[01:36] of course you should be careful with the
[01:38] data that you're putting into something
[01:39] like deep SE Q3 but um I just kind of
[01:41] wanted to bring you the facts of what I
[01:43] know and um how to actually plug it into
[01:45] nadn and just get in there and play
[01:46] around with it a little bit so let's get
[01:48] into nadn so today I'm going to be
[01:50] talking about two ways to connect deep
[01:51] seek fe3 into nadn so the first one is
[01:54] hooking it up as the brain for your AI
[01:56] agent the chat model for your AI agent
[01:58] as you can see right here it looks like
[01:59] we're connect in to an open AI chat
[02:01] model but if you click in you can see
[02:02] that we're actually using an open router
[02:04] base URL to point us to deep seek chat
[02:07] so that's what's going on here and then
[02:09] the second way is to use it as um sort
[02:11] of its own node like a open AI message
[02:13] and model node so as you can see here
[02:15] we're doing a post request to deep seek
[02:17] and we're sending in information for it
[02:19] to come back with a response so I'll
[02:20] real quickly show off these two methods
[02:22] and then we'll get into how you actually
[02:23] do it so first we'll do this one as you
[02:26] can see here it's a post request to deep
[02:28] seek um we have stuff that I'll show you
[02:30] guys how to configure and then pretty
[02:32] much in here what we're asking it to do
[02:33] is we're sending write me a Facebook
[02:35] post about the following topic um the
[02:37] topics Dynamic based on what we put into
[02:39] this set node right here which is Health
[02:41] and Fitness in 2025 so let's fire this
[02:43] off real quick um as you can see it's
[02:45] hitting deep seek and then it's going to
[02:46] come back to us with a result which
[02:49] should be a formatted Facebook post with
[02:51] emo with Emojis and probably um hashtags
[02:54] at the end as you can see health and
[02:56] fitness the future is here it's got a
[02:57] couple points and then it ends with a
[02:59] nice little motivational message um and
[03:02] if this is confusing to you it's the
[03:04] exact same way that you would set up an
[03:05] open ey message in model node and you've
[03:06] probably done that multiple times you've
[03:09] got a system role right here which is
[03:10] we're defining what this node is going
[03:11] to do we're just saying you're helpful
[03:13] assistant and then we have the actual
[03:14] user role which is what we want it to
[03:17] take and do which is writing a Facebook
[03:19] post about health and fitness in 2025 so
[03:22] if that's confusing just look at it like
[03:24] this right in open AI usually your set
[03:26] up your different messages we've got a
[03:28] system roll and then a user rle so right
[03:30] here helpful assistant write me a
[03:31] Facebook post and it's pretty much the
[03:33] exact same thing coming through so um
[03:37] that's pretty much all that's going on
[03:38] here I just wanted to let this finish so
[03:40] we can see the difference there we go so
[03:42] this was using 40 um and this one again
[03:47] is a little bit different because it
[03:48] used a different model but same aspect
[03:50] of Facebook post anyways now we'll come
[03:53] up here and we'll pretty much do that
[03:55] same thing so um this is connected to
[03:59] um what's it called Deep seek V3 and
[04:01] we'll do the same thing make a
[04:04] Facebook
[04:05] post about health and fitness
[04:09] 2025 and okay so we actually didn't
[04:13] connect our credential real quick we
[04:14] were connected to our openi account but
[04:16] as you can see I have a different
[04:17] credential here which is the Deep seek
[04:19] one so I'll show you guys how to set
[04:20] this up but now this should work fine um
[04:22] let's go back in here send that
[04:25] off and I know it's a little confusing
[04:27] because it looks like it's still an open
[04:28] AI chat model but like I said we all we
[04:31] have to do is grabb a API key from open
[04:33] router and then we'll be good to go to
[04:34] set everything up okay there we go so
[04:36] now we got our Facebook post back um
[04:38] very similar with its um hashtags at the
[04:41] end with its different emojis for
[04:42] different sections and yeah so those are
[04:44] the two use cases that we're going to
[04:45] walk over real quick um so let's hop
[04:48] into deep seek and set everything up
[04:50] okay so you're going to go to deep
[04:51] seek.com you'll come into the screen
[04:53] you'll sign in or you create an account
[04:55] and then you're going to click on access
[04:56] API so this is going to take you
[04:58] straight to your API settings so um it
[05:01] took me to my usage as you can see I put
[05:03] in $2 I've got over 7 million tokens
[05:05] you're going to click on API Keys create
[05:07] new
[05:08] key um we'll call this one demo and then
[05:10] you want to copy that and paste it
[05:12] somewhere safe because you won't be able
[05:14] to re access it and you could always
[05:15] just create a new one but best practice
[05:17] is to paste it somewhere safe then you
[05:19] need to make sure you have some tokens
[05:20] available so just add in like two bucks
[05:23] and then you want to click on docs down
[05:24] here on the left side this is going to
[05:26] bring you to this API documentation um
[05:29] and we have to do is scroll down right
[05:30] here we've got a Curl we're going to
[05:32] copy this curl and it's going to be
[05:34] super easy we'll hop back into n8n as
[05:36] you can see there's currently no deep
[05:37] seek integration so what we have to do
[05:39] is grab an HTTP
[05:41] request and all we have to do is import
[05:43] curl and paste that right in there so as
[05:46] you can see it's going to change it to a
[05:47] post request it put in the correct
[05:49] endpoint and it has our header already
[05:51] which is our authorization um and then
[05:53] it has our Json already filled out so
[05:54] super easy now what you want to do is
[05:56] you got to go grab that API key and then
[05:59] you want to get get rid of this it's
[06:00] going to be Bearer space your API key
[06:03] and then make sure there's no extra
[06:05] leading or trailing white space as well
[06:07] and that should work so right now what
[06:08] we're sending over is the prompt is
[06:11] hello to a helpful assistant we'll just
[06:13] hit test step to make sure everything's
[06:14] working um and as you can see we got
[06:16] back hello how can I assist you today so
[06:18] it was responding to the message which
[06:20] was hello so that's pretty much it at
[06:22] this point you would set up you know you
[06:24] could prompt this um this deep seek node
[06:27] a little differently if you wanted it to
[06:28] do something more specific and then you
[06:30] could dynamically give the information
[06:32] that you want it to respond to okay now
[06:35] to set up a chat model so let's delete
[06:36] this one we're going to add another one
[06:38] which is an open AI chat model and this
[06:39] is like the default way that it pretty
[06:41] much opens up um and we need to create a
[06:43] new credential but before that we need
[06:45] to set up everything with open router so
[06:47] we're going to click add option and
[06:48] we're going to add a base URL default of
[06:50] course it points to open AI because
[06:52] that's the um model we're we're grabbing
[06:55] but we're going to go to open router
[06:57] you'll create an account and then all we
[06:59] need to do is go to deep seek
[07:02] V3 what we want to do here is click on
[07:05] API and we're looking for a base URL to
[07:08] point to to grab deep seek so we're
[07:10] going to grab this right here base URL
[07:13] within the quotations copy that go back
[07:16] into
[07:17] nidn paste that in there so now we're
[07:20] accessing the base URL of open router
[07:22] and then up here instead of accessing
[07:24] GPT 40 mini or whatever model you're
[07:26] using change it to an expression you're
[07:28] going to get rid of that go back into
[07:30] open router and make sure you're on deep
[07:32] seek fe3 you're going to copy that right
[07:35] here deep seek deep seek Das chat and
[07:38] then you're going to paste that in there
[07:39] so now we're pointing to open router URL
[07:43] which is grabbing this model of deep
[07:44] seek and now before we hit out of here
[07:47] we need to create new credential so you
[07:49] can see I've got a deep seat credential
[07:50] I'm going to create a new one but first
[07:52] we need to um create an API key so
[07:54] you're already in this page you're going
[07:56] to click create API key you're going to
[07:58] create key
[08:00] name it whatever you
[08:01] want and then same thing as always copy
[08:04] this into somewhere safe and then you're
[08:07] pretty much just going to go back into
[08:08] NN hit create new credential and paste
[08:10] your API key right into here once you do
[08:12] that you're going to hit save in the
[08:14] bottom right it's going to go green and
[08:15] say your credential is currently private
[08:18] to you and right here it's going to go
[08:19] red not exactly sure why it does that
[08:21] but you're connected if if you get the
[08:23] green down here um that might just be a
[08:26] bug but we're good to go so we've got
[08:28] our API key from open router set up
[08:30] right here where we have the Deep seek
[08:32] model that we want and then we have open
[08:33] router um being able to access this uh
[08:37] model for us so now we just want to test
[08:39] to make sure it's working um we're going
[08:40] to open up a chat and we'll do this
[08:42] again but instead of health and fitness
[08:43] we will do um Sports and we'll see what
[08:47] it says here and as you can see it's
[08:49] hitting the model right now which is
[08:51] obviously deep seek even though it looks
[08:52] like open Ai and we know that it's
[08:55] working because it would have already
[08:56] failed by now if we didn't have it set
[08:57] up as you saw earlier it failed really
[08:59] quick
[09:00] okay so it just popped through we've got
[09:02] Sports in 2025 where Innovation meets
[09:04] passion again emojis little things and
[09:06] remember this is zero prompting at all
[09:08] um but then it ends with some hashtags
[09:10] but yeah like I said there's no
[09:11] prompting going on in here but this is
[09:13] of course the chat input that I got and
[09:15] our output so um that's pretty much
[09:17] going to be it for this one I know it
[09:18] wasn't too complex but I just wanted to
[09:20] show you guys how you can access this
[09:21] stuff so you can get in there and start
[09:22] playing around with it I'm definitely
[09:23] going to play around with a little bit
[09:24] more you know some complex agents with
[09:27] our deep seek model and just seeing how
[09:29] it reacts to them um you know using
[09:31] different tools and stuff but um you
[09:34] know two credits in deep seek five
[09:36] credits in open router an open router
[09:38] you have a ton of different models you
[09:39] can access as well but those credits
[09:40] will get you a long way for sure but
[09:42] yeah as always if you found this one
[09:43] helpful please give it a like definitely
[09:44] helps me out great to be back um hope
[09:46] you guys all had a happy New Year I'm
[09:48] really excited to see what 2025 brings
[09:50] as far as you know the channel the AI
[09:52] space all that kind of stuff and
[09:54] definitely let me know in the comments
[09:55] what else you guys are looking to see in
[09:56] the next few weeks in the next few
[09:57] months and in the next year so um thanks
[10:00] for making it the end of this one guys
