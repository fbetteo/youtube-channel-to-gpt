[00:00] I just 100% automated viral shorts.
[00:02] Okay, so you can already see there's
[00:04] kind of like five main blocks, which is
[00:06] first of all, we're going to be creating
[00:07] the scenes. Then we're going to be
[00:08] creating those close-up images. Then
[00:10] we're going to be creating the winner
[00:11] images. From there, we're going to pull
[00:13] all of the pictures back in, render the
[00:14] final video together, and then we're
[00:15] sending it off to Instagram, Tik Tok,
[00:17] and YouTube to be published. Okay, so
[00:19] for this run, as you can see, based on
[00:21] our Google sheet, this is going to be
[00:22] ape versus big cats. And it's going to
[00:25] pull in because we have this marked as
[00:26] to-do. So I'm going to go back into the
[00:28] workflow. I'm going to hit test workflow
[00:29] and we're basically just going to watch
[00:30] this thing start. So after this we move
[00:32] on to the next step which is the scene
[00:34] creator agent. And you can see what we
[00:35] give this agent as the user message is
[00:37] two things. The first thing is the main
[00:39] character and then the second thing is
[00:40] the type of opponent. So basically this
[00:42] agent's job is to take the main
[00:43] character and the opponents. And as you
[00:45] can see on the right hand side it spits
[00:47] out eight different scenes which are the
[00:48] eight different opponents that the main
[00:50] character is going to be fighting in
[00:52] this YouTube short. Anyways, what we do
[00:54] is we feed those eight items into this
[00:56] image prompt generator where we're going
[00:58] to be giving this agent the main animal
[01:00] and the opponent. So now you can see we
[01:02] have 16 items and these are all 16 of
[01:04] our images. And if I was to click into
[01:06] the URL that it returns for um item one,
[01:09] we can see that this is an intimidating
[01:11] looking ape that is roaring at us. All
[01:13] right, so now that we have all of our
[01:14] close-up images done, we can move on to
[01:16] the next section of the workflow, which
[01:18] is creating the winner images. So what
[01:20] we're doing here is once again we're
[01:21] prompting an AI agent and we're going to
[01:23] give it two different animals. So up
[01:24] here we have animal one, animal two and
[01:26] as you can see on this right hand side
[01:28] what we get back are eight different
[01:29] image prompts and each of these image
[01:30] prompts are going to contain, you know,
[01:32] like which of these animals actually won
[01:34] the fight. But after we send over these
[01:36] eight different scenes, it's going to do
[01:37] the exact same thing where it tells us,
[01:39] okay, we got your request, we're
[01:40] processing it. Please wait a little bit.
[01:42] So we go ahead and wait 90 seconds. We
[01:44] check back in and then we grab all of
[01:46] the completed images. So, let's scroll
[01:48] down to a random one down here and we
[01:49] will see who won this fight. Okay, so it
[01:51] looks like this one was a tiger that
[01:53] clearly beat up this ape. Okay, cool.
[01:56] So, we have all 24 elements. You can see
[01:58] the final video is already done, but the
[01:59] next section of the workflow is to
[02:01] render it all together. So, what we're
[02:03] doing here is we're hitting an API
[02:04] called create a mate. And if I click
[02:06] into create a mate, you can see here are
[02:07] all of my renders and this is our
[02:09] completed video. And then we're going to
[02:10] go ahead and do the same thing where we
[02:12] check back in on the video. And you can
[02:14] see we get it right here as a binary
[02:16] file. So, let's take a quick little
[02:17] sneak peek.
