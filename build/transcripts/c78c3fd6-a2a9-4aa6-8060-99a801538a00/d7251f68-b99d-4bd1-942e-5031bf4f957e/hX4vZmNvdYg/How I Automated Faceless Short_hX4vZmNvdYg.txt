[00:00] this is how I generate and post faceless
[00:01] YouTube content on autopilot so we have
[00:03] this Google sheet with four different
[00:04] animals and then a Style and what we do
[00:06] is we feed that into NN where an image
[00:08] prompt generator agent takes those
[00:10] animals and takes those Styles and
[00:12] creates really good image prompts for it
[00:14] and then we feed those text prompts into
[00:15] an API to generate those images once we
[00:17] have them back we feed them into an
[00:19] image to video generator and then once
[00:21] we're done with that we feed that down
[00:22] here for the agent to create a sound
[00:24] prompt based on the style of the video
[00:26] and then we feed that into 11 labs to
[00:27] actually make that sound effect finally
[00:29] we merge everything together down here
[00:30] all the video files all the text and the
[00:32] audio file and then we basically throw
[00:34] it into another API to create that final
[00:36] video Once that's done we download the
[00:38] video upload it to YouTube and then we
[00:39] update the sheet and so as you can see
[00:41] on the right we have these five videos
[00:42] that have been created and processed and
[00:44] now we have five final links to look at
[00:46] so here are the futuristic cyberpunk
[00:51] [Applause]
[00:56] Rebels and now let's take a look at the
[00:58] Cowboy Wild West show down
[01:08] animals if you want to find out how you
[01:10] can build this for yourself or even just
[01:11] download this entire template for free
[01:13] all you got to do is go watch the video
[01:14] in the description and I'll explain see
[01:16] you guys over there
