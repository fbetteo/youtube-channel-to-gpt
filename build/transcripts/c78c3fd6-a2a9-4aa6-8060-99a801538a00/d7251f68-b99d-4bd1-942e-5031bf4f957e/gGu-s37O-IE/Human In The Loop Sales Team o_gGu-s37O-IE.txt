[00:00] I just built this human in- thee Loop
[00:01] sales team of AI agents in nadn using no
[00:03] code the sales agent is now pulling in
[00:05] data from our project database to craft
[00:07] that email that it's going to send off
[00:08] to us for approval and now you can see
[00:10] that we're waiting for feedback so if I
[00:12] refresh my email right here we have a
[00:14] new email this one says approval
[00:16] required for a new lead Robert
[00:17] California dear Robert thank you for
[00:19] reaching out to Dunder AI regarding your
[00:21] custom AI powered customer support and
[00:23] sales optimization system and then the
[00:24] call to action at the end I'd love to
[00:26] schedule a call to discuss your project
[00:27] in more detail so what I'm saying in the
[00:29] feedback is make make it more concise
[00:30] because this email is pretty wordy and
[00:32] then I said also don't mention 23% in
[00:34] reduction time right up here and propose
[00:37] that we meet on Thursday hit submit now
[00:39] the agent's got that feedback it's
[00:40] sending it to the revision agent and
[00:42] it's taking that original email that was
[00:43] created by the sales agent and revising
[00:45] it based on our feedback but now we have
[00:46] a new email as you can see it's much
[00:47] shorter um the results were impressive
[00:49] with significant increases in sales
[00:50] conversion and customer satisfaction so
[00:52] it got rid of the um decrease in
[00:55] response time I'd like to schedule a
[00:56] call this Thursday to discuss your
[00:58] project in detail this looks good to go
[01:00] we'll hit respond we'll say send it off
[01:03] and then we'll submit that and then
[01:04] we'll watch this go up into the approved
[01:06] branch and now that email got sent off
[01:08] so let's go check on that real quick so
[01:09] here's that email that got sent off to
[01:10] Robert California this is the one that
[01:12] we just read through and approved as you
[01:13] can see meeting on Thursday doesn't
[01:15] mention 23% reduction and it signs off
[01:17] best regards JY Dunder AI if you want to
