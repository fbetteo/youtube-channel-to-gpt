[00:00] Here's how you connect chatbt to your
[00:01] nadn agents. On the left we have
[00:03] catchbt. On the right we have my naden
[00:05] assistant. And what I'm going to do is
[00:06] send off this message that says can you
[00:08] send an email to Dexter Morgan to see if
[00:10] he has an update on project panda. I'm
[00:12] going to allow it to talk to my noden.
[00:13] And you can see over here it receives
[00:15] that message from the web hook. It's
[00:16] going to get Dexter Morgan's contact
[00:18] information and send him an email. And
[00:19] then it's going to respond back to us in
[00:21] chatbt using this respond to web hook
[00:23] node. And it says the email to Dexter
[00:25] Morgan asking for an update on project
[00:27] panda has been sent. Let me know if you
[00:28] need help with anything else. And as you
[00:30] can see over here, we have that email
[00:32] that was successfully sent to
[00:33] dextermiami.com.
[00:35] Okay, so how the system works is we're
[00:37] going to build a custom GPT and in that
[00:39] GPT, we're going to give it an action,
[00:40] which is the ability to send data to our
[00:42] NIDAN web hook right here. So the demo
[00:44] that I just showed was a pretty fun
[00:46] example, but we're going to go over an
[00:47] example of a very practical one where
[00:49] you can drop in a invoice into your
[00:51] custom GPT and then it will send the
[00:53] data to NADN for you to upload into like
[00:54] a database. If you want to watch the
[00:56] full breakdown, click on that play
[00:57] button right here.
