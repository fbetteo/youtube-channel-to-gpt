[00:00] Hey guys, in this video I'm going to be
[00:01] showing you how to set up your own Hey
[00:03] Gen avatar so you can automate content
[00:05] creation. And guess what? I'm an AI
[00:07] clone of Nate. Sorry guys, I had to do
[00:08] that to you. Had to see if you were
[00:10] impressed by the quality of the video or
[00:11] not. But what I'm going to do is show
[00:12] you how to set up this workflow that's
[00:14] super super simple so that you can
[00:15] automate that type of content creation
[00:17] with your own avatar, with your own
[00:18] voice. And it's going to be super cool
[00:20] and not too hard at all. So by the end
[00:22] of this video, you'll have this entire
[00:23] system set up for you. I'll also give
[00:25] you this exact template so you can
[00:26] basically just plug and play your own
[00:27] avatar. But what we're going to do is
[00:29] get into Hey Genen, walk through
[00:30] everything step by step so you see how I
[00:32] created my avatar, how I created my
[00:33] voice, and then how I plugged that into
[00:35] Naden. And that really just like opens
[00:37] the door to 10x 20xing your content
[00:40] because now instead of sitting in front
[00:41] of a camera, you can basically just feed
[00:43] in scripts into this niten automation
[00:44] and you're going to get content
[00:46] basically on autopilot. And the idea is
[00:48] that this is really going to open up
[00:49] your eyes to different use cases where
[00:50] you could have every day, you know,
[00:51] you're scraping some sort of news like
[00:52] we were doing down here. You could be
[00:54] scraping Instagram content. you could be
[00:56] scraping whatever it is and just feeding
[00:57] those scripts into your avatar. So,
[00:59] super cool. Let's get into the video.
[01:01] All right, so we're just going to jump
[01:02] right into it and I'm going to walk you
[01:03] guys through every single step. So, I'm
[01:05] at Hey GenE. You can get to Hey Genen
[01:06] using the link in the description and
[01:08] I'm just going to go ahead and create an
[01:09] account real quick. All right, now that
[01:10] we've signed in, I'm just going to start
[01:11] off using the free plan and just have to
[01:13] do some fun little onboarding real
[01:14] quick. Okay, so now that we're in Hen,
[01:16] we have a ton of different options. And
[01:18] what we're going to be focusing on today
[01:19] is creating our own avatar, our own
[01:21] voice, and then using that over an API
[01:22] in NAND. So, we can completely automate
[01:24] all of this content creation. But, as
[01:26] you can see, there's some new features
[01:27] like they have the talking baby podcast
[01:29] that's been kind of blowing up on social
[01:30] media. You can also have this new
[01:32] feature called Avatar 4 where you just
[01:34] put in a photo and a script and it's
[01:36] going to do the whole thing. So, it's
[01:38] going to be quicker than creating your
[01:39] own avatar. But, these two are not
[01:41] available over API yet. When they are,
[01:43] you can bet that I'm going to make a
[01:44] video about it. But right now, we're
[01:45] going to be focusing on creating our own
[01:47] avatar. So, I'm going to click on this
[01:48] button. I'm going to skip past this
[01:49] video. And now, it's basically telling
[01:51] us that we need to submit 2 to 5 minutes
[01:53] of footage with a camera where we are
[01:55] looking directly into the camera. We're
[01:56] talking. We're doing natural generic
[01:58] gestures with our hands and stuff like
[02:00] that. And this is what it's going to use
[02:01] to create our avatar. And it's going to
[02:03] use this to mimic all of the videos that
[02:05] we want to create. And a little tip here
[02:07] is to make your avatar lively and
[02:09] expressive. Exaggerate your emotions
[02:10] when speaking. Feel free to talk about
[02:12] any topic in the language of your
[02:13] choice. be yourself. Look at the camera.
[02:15] And so I'm going to click next. And what
[02:16] I'm going to do is just go ahead and
[02:18] record footage of me talking for about 2
[02:20] minutes. Okay, so just finished that up.
[02:22] As you guys can see, I only had to do
[02:24] about 30 seconds. So I just kind of
[02:25] smiled and used hand gestures and talked
[02:27] about what it is I do, all that kind of
[02:29] stuff. It was random, but I'm going to
[02:30] hit next. And but I also had to go
[02:33] record a quick little permission
[02:34] message. So I I said this into the
[02:36] camera as you can see. And now we're
[02:38] pretty much done. What happens is it's
[02:40] going to use this to create a avatar. It
[02:43] says that we don't have two minutes of
[02:44] footage, but it prompted me to only
[02:45] record about 30 seconds. So, we're going
[02:47] to go ahead and submit this and I'll
[02:48] check back in when we have our avatar.
[02:50] Okay, so it says that our avatar is
[02:51] ready. I'm just going to go ahead and
[02:52] name this Nate Herk and confirm that we
[02:54] are good to go here. And it's basically
[02:56] going to load this up. When we submitted
[02:57] that footage, it's also going to clone
[02:59] our voice. But if you already have a
[03:00] voice clone you really like of yourself
[03:01] on something like 11 Labs, you can also
[03:03] go ahead and pull that in. All right, so
[03:05] I'm a little nervous, but let's click
[03:06] into this avatar and see what it looks
[03:08] like. We'll check out this. Hey Nate
[03:09] Herklman, your hyperrealistic avatar is
[03:12] ready. Try creating videos with it.
[03:14] Also, click the feedback button to share
[03:16] what you think. Okay, that's really not
[03:18] too bad. So now we can access this
[03:20] avatar over API, which is going to be
[03:22] pretty cool. And we can obviously say,
[03:23] hey, here's exactly the script you need
[03:25] to read off and we'll be good to go. All
[03:28] right, so before we hop into Nitn, I
[03:29] just wanted to talk about highle how
[03:30] this works. So what we're doing is we're
[03:33] going to access Hey Jen's API and we're
[03:35] going to access the one to create a
[03:36] video with an avatar. And when we're
[03:38] doing this, we basically need to tell,
[03:40] hey, Jen, okay, which avatar do we want
[03:42] to use, which is this one that we just
[03:43] created. And also, which voice do we
[03:45] want to use, which is the one that it
[03:46] just cloned of us. All right, so just
[03:48] open up a new workflow in Naden. And
[03:49] what I'm going to do is I'm just going
[03:50] to open up an HTTP request because this
[03:53] is how we can actually communicate with
[03:54] Hen server and get a video back. So in
[03:57] order to configure this node the way we
[03:58] need to, we want to look at Hen's API
[04:01] documentation for the API reference. And
[04:03] I just navigated down here to the create
[04:05] avatar video endpoint. And what's really
[04:08] nice about Hen's API documentation is
[04:10] that they have our curl command over
[04:11] here, which we love. So I'm going to go
[04:12] ahead and click on request example. And
[04:14] now I can just go ahead and copy this
[04:15] curl request, go back into naden and
[04:18] import this curl. And once I import
[04:20] that, it's basically going to configure
[04:21] this exactly how we need it. And now we
[04:23] just have to configure a few things
[04:25] based on, you know, what we want the
[04:26] avatar to say and which avatar we want
[04:28] to access. And so the first thing that
[04:30] we need to do is we need to put in our
[04:31] API key because otherwise, hey Jen is
[04:33] not going to give us permission to
[04:35] access the avatar we just built. So, I'm
[04:37] going to go back into Hen. I am going to
[04:39] go ahead and find my API key, which
[04:40] maybe it will be here in my settings,
[04:42] subscriptions and API, Hen API, and then
[04:45] API token right there. So, I'm just
[04:46] going to go ahead and click copy. And
[04:48] now that I've copied that to my
[04:49] clipboard, I'm going to go in here and
[04:51] basically put it right here. But what I
[04:54] want to do is because I want to save
[04:55] this header for forever, I am going to
[04:58] add this as a header authentication up
[04:59] here. So, if you don't understand
[05:01] exactly what I'm talking about,
[05:02] definitely go and check out the API
[05:04] video that I made right up here. But
[05:05] what I'm going to do is authentication.
[05:07] I'm going to click on generic. I'm going
[05:09] to go to a header off because you can
[05:11] see right here that's what it was going
[05:12] to have us set up was a header off. And
[05:15] I'm just going to go ahead and create a
[05:16] new one. We're first of all just going
[05:17] to name this Hey Jen because that's what
[05:21] we're accessing. And now we just need to
[05:23] paste our API key right in here. And
[05:25] then for the name, if we go back into
[05:26] the documentation, you can see right
[05:28] here that the name for this header is
[05:29] supposed to be
[05:30] X-api-. So, I'm just going to copy that,
[05:33] throw it back in here, and then when we
[05:34] hit save, we are now basically
[05:36] authenticated into Hey Genen, and then I
[05:38] can go ahead and remove this API key
[05:40] section right there. So, now our
[05:41] credentials saved. Okay, so now if we
[05:43] scroll down to the body that we're
[05:44] sending over, I'm just going to make
[05:45] this an expression and open up full
[05:47] screen so we can look at it. This is
[05:49] basically just like different settings
[05:50] that we have. And honestly, this body is
[05:52] pretty confusing. There's a lot going
[05:53] on. So, all I'm going to do real quick
[05:54] is just paste in a different request
[05:56] that I set up. And this one's a lot more
[05:58] straightforward where we're basically
[05:59] saying, "What's the avatar? what's the
[06:01] voice and what is the avatar going to be
[06:03] saying. So, as you can see, what we need
[06:06] to do is we need to go find our avatar
[06:07] ID and our voice ID. So, there are a
[06:09] couple ways that we can find these IDs.
[06:11] The easiest and most straightforward one
[06:12] is to come into Hey Genen, go to your
[06:14] avatars, click on the avatar you want,
[06:15] and then you come here and click copy
[06:17] avatar ID, and then to find your voice,
[06:19] same thing. You'd come into the voice,
[06:20] and then right here, you click on um
[06:22] oop, sorry, you'd click on get voice ID.
[06:24] And so, that works. you could just plug
[06:26] it into your um you know, plug it into
[06:28] the body request in the right spot and
[06:30] you'd be good to go. But also, if you
[06:32] want to be able to sort of like
[06:33] dynamically pull in these different
[06:35] voices and stuff like that, what you
[06:36] could do is when you go to the
[06:38] documentation, you can see on the left
[06:39] there's list all avatars and list all
[06:42] voices. So, just to show you guys how
[06:43] that would work is once again we'd come
[06:45] in here and we have our curl request.
[06:46] I'd copy that. I'd come back into this
[06:49] workflow and I'd open up a new HTTP
[06:50] request and all I'd have to do is import
[06:53] this curl once again. And now
[06:54] everything's set up. And you can see
[06:56] that because we've already saved our
[06:58] authentication, we can go in here and go
[07:00] back to header off. And all we have to
[07:02] do is go choose our 11 Labs credential
[07:04] that we had just set up together or
[07:06] sorry, not 11 Labs, hey Genen. So that's
[07:08] the one we just used. And now if I hit
[07:09] test step, this is basically going to
[07:11] access our Hen account and it's going to
[07:12] pull back all the avatars. And there's
[07:14] going to be a ton. So this might take a
[07:15] while because this is, as you can see,
[07:17] there's a ton of data. It's not just our
[07:19] avatar, even though here's the one we
[07:20] just made for ourselves. This is also
[07:22] going to be all the other avatars that
[07:24] we can already access that are pre-built
[07:25] on Hey Gen servers. So, as you can see,
[07:27] there's a
[07:31] ton. So, now that I have my avatar ID, I
[07:34] will just go ahead and copy this right
[07:35] here. As you can see, that's Nate
[07:36] Hurkeleman. I would just come back into
[07:38] our generate video node, and I'm just
[07:40] going to replace this right here with
[07:42] our avatar ID. And then to get our
[07:44] avatar voice, I would do the exact same
[07:46] thing, except for I'd come here to the
[07:47] list all voices endpoint. I would copy
[07:49] this curl command, open up another HTTP
[07:52] request, and import that in. And then
[07:53] I'm just going to choose my Hey Genen
[07:55] credential once again. And then when I
[07:57] test this step, it's going to be pulling
[07:58] back all of the voices that are in our
[07:59] Hen account. And then we'll choose our
[08:01] voice ID, as you can see right here, is
[08:03] Nate Hkelman. And we would paste that
[08:05] in. So I'm just going to grab
[08:07] this. I'm going to put that into the
[08:09] right spot in our body request for which
[08:11] voice do we want to access. So I'll
[08:13] throw that in right there. And now all
[08:14] we have to do is set up the actual text.
[08:17] All right, cool. So, I'm going to come
[08:18] in here and just to test this out and
[08:20] see how it works, I'm going to manually
[08:21] type in this text field and just throw
[08:24] in some information that I wanted to
[08:25] say. Okay, so I filled in some text and
[08:28] all we're going to do now is hit test
[08:29] step. And what this does is it's
[08:31] basically sending a request over to Hen
[08:33] servers and saying, "Cool, we've started
[08:35] working on that video." And what we get
[08:37] back is a video ID. So now that we have
[08:39] the video ID, we need to go back into
[08:41] the hen documentation and there's
[08:42] another endpoint for retrieving a video
[08:44] status and the details where we're
[08:46] basically going to give it that video ID
[08:48] and then it will be able to give us the
[08:50] actual status of the video. So you
[08:52] guessed it. I'm going to go ahead and
[08:53] copy this curl command. I'm going to add
[08:55] another HTTP request right after this
[08:57] one. And we're going to import that
[08:59] curl. Once again, we don't have to put
[09:02] our API key there because we've already
[09:03] saved it up here. And then all we need
[09:05] to do is feed over the actual video ID.
[09:08] So I'm going to connect these two things
[09:09] so we can access it. And we can see in
[09:11] order to access that video ID, we need
[09:13] to send it over as a query parameter. So
[09:15] I'm just going to check on query
[09:16] parameters. It's going to be called
[09:19] video ID. And then we're just going to
[09:21] drag in this variable. So now every time
[09:22] whenever we generate a video, this node
[09:24] is always just going to be pulling in
[09:26] that exact video that we already
[09:27] generated. So I'm going to call this one
[09:28] get video. And we'll hit test step. And
[09:30] we will see if we get a video. The
[09:32] status is complete. And let's open this
[09:34] up real quick and take a look. Hey guys,
[09:37] in this video I'm going to be showing
[09:38] you how to set up your own Hey Genen
[09:39] avatar so you can automate content
[09:41] creation. And guess what? I'm an AI
[09:42] clone of Nate. Okay, honestly like that
[09:45] that looked pretty good, right? Like the
[09:47] movements and everything. I I almost
[09:48] thought that it was me talking. I mean,
[09:50] it was. So that was just a 7-second
[09:52] clip, right? But that's how this works
[09:54] and that's how you can send over these
[09:56] requests to make videos in Naden and you
[09:59] can do this automatically. So let's talk
[10:00] about a way you could actually like
[10:02] automate this process. Okay, so the
[10:04] problem with this is when we make a
[10:05] request to Hey Jen to start up that
[10:06] video, it's not going to be ready
[10:08] instantly. So, we're going to have to do
[10:09] like a wait step right here and then
[10:11] probably pulling just to make sure it's
[10:13] done before we move on. So, what we're
[10:15] going to do is first of all just copy
[10:17] and paste these two down here, wherever
[10:19] those went down here. Um, and then I
[10:20] have these two nodes which I want to
[10:22] show like just an example use case of
[10:23] how this could work. So, what we're
[10:25] going to do is let's say this was like a
[10:27] scheduled trigger. So, every morning
[10:29] this would go off at like 7:00 a.m. What
[10:31] I have right here is it's hitting Apify
[10:33] to scrape the morning brew. So, if you
[10:35] guys know what morning brew is, every
[10:36] morning it comes out with like an issue
[10:38] about like a brief on what's going on,
[10:40] right? So, as you can see, it's scraping
[10:42] the morning brew. It's basically getting
[10:44] back all of the text content that's in
[10:46] the morning brew. And then we're feeding
[10:47] this into a script writer that's
[10:49] basically its job is to take that
[10:51] morning brew and just turn it into a
[10:52] short script. As you can see right
[10:54] there, it's a lot shorter. And then we
[10:56] could feed this dynamic script every
[10:57] morning into our hijen avatar. So that's
[10:59] what I'm going to do right here in the
[11:02] body instead of this text that we
[11:03] manually typed in earlier. I'm just
[11:05] going to drag in this variable. And now
[11:07] every morning the avatar is going to be
[11:09] reading off like a quick brief about
[11:10] today's news. So what I'm going to do is
[11:12] just test this step. And by the way, if
[11:14] you want to watch a full video about
[11:15] appy, I'll tag it right up here. And of
[11:17] course you can pin this data just so we
[11:18] don't have to make another call to open
[11:21] router servers and appy server. But
[11:23] anyways, what we're going to do is test
[11:24] this step. So, it's grabbing that
[11:26] script. It created it. It's creating a
[11:28] video right now as we speak. But if we
[11:30] click into the git video, we can see
[11:32] that the status is waiting and it's not
[11:34] yet done. And if we were to go ahead and
[11:35] just test this again, we can see that
[11:37] now the status is processing. So, what
[11:39] happens is when you first make that
[11:41] request, the status is waiting. And then
[11:43] when you check in later, it's going to
[11:44] say processing until it's finally done.
[11:46] So what we're going to do is we're going
[11:47] to first of all just add a wait node
[11:49] right here which is just going to wait
[11:51] for let's say 30 seconds. So now we're
[11:53] waiting for 30 seconds before we check
[11:55] in to see if it's done. Okay. So we just
[11:57] waited 30 seconds and now you can see
[11:58] that the video is done. So the status
[12:00] equals complete. So what we're going to
[12:02] do is we are going to basically check in
[12:04] and say okay if the status equals
[12:06] completed we're going to continue on.
[12:08] But if it doesn't equal completed we're
[12:10] basically just going to loop back and
[12:11] continue to check until it's done. And
[12:13] I'll show you guys a live example of
[12:14] that. But first, let's check in on this
[12:15] video and see how it came out. Side
[12:17] hustles are booming with 44% of
[12:19] Americans juggling extra gigs mostly to
[12:21] cover living costs, though most make
[12:22] under $500 a month. The classic drop
[12:25] shipping t-shirt biz faces new hurdles
[12:27] after Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese
[12:29] imports, squeezing already thin margins.
[12:31] Meanwhile, celebrities keep cashing in
[12:33] on booze brands even as the
[12:34] non-alcoholic market heats up. Okay, I
[12:37] mean, that's pretty insane, right? Like,
[12:38] that could easily be every day you could
[12:40] just pump out a few shorts if that's
[12:42] what you want to do. um because you're
[12:43] just getting this scrape of daily news
[12:45] and then you're just getting that type
[12:46] of content right away. And if you think
[12:48] about it, it could really like 20x your
[12:50] content game because then all you have
[12:51] to do is feed it scripts rather than sit
[12:52] in front of a camera and actually talk.
[12:54] But anyways, let's continue with this
[12:56] polling method. So, we're going to do an
[12:58] if, which is going to be our conditional
[13:00] check to say, do we move on or do we
[13:02] not? And essentially in natural language
[13:04] that we're checking for if the video is
[13:05] done. So, I'm going to drag in this
[13:07] status field right here. And I'm going
[13:08] to say if status equals completed, and
[13:11] keep in mind this has to be word for
[13:13] word
[13:14] exactly. And keep in mind this has to be
[13:16] letter for letter a match of what it
[13:18] equals right now. And if it does equal
[13:20] complete, it's going to go down the true
[13:21] branch and nothing's going to happen. Or
[13:23] you know, whatever else we need to
[13:24] happen, auto posting, whatever. But if
[13:26] it equals false, what we're going to do
[13:28] is we're going to add another wait step.
[13:29] Let's just say this time we'll wait.
[13:31] Actually, yeah, 5 seconds is fine. We're
[13:33] going to wait for 5 seconds. And then
[13:34] we're basically just going to go ahead
[13:35] and reactivate this node that's checking
[13:37] in on the content. So, what we're going
[13:39] to do is run this thing again. And I'm
[13:40] just going to turn this down to like 10
[13:42] seconds so we can basically see what
[13:43] happens when the video is not ready yet.
[13:46] And real quick, instead of the dynamic,
[13:48] um, I'm just going to put my own script
[13:49] in here just so we can see a different
[13:51] type of story. All right, so I put my
[13:53] own script in there and you guys will
[13:54] see once this video is done. But we're
[13:56] going to hit test step. It's going to
[13:58] generate the video. It's going to wait
[13:59] 10 seconds. It's going to check in on
[14:00] the video. Hopefully the video is not
[14:02] done yet. So, it's going to loop down
[14:03] and then you'll see it's just going to
[14:04] continue to loop until the video is
[14:06] done. So, we'll just watch this happen.
[14:08] There you go. The video is not
[14:09] completed. So, we're going to wait for 5
[14:11] more seconds. We're going to check back
[14:12] in and we can see again it's not
[14:15] completed. So, this is called polling.
[14:16] And this is how you can basically just
[14:18] guarantee that the process doesn't move
[14:19] on until the video is actually finished.
[14:21] And what this can do is give you a good
[14:23] time estimate of what you should set the
[14:24] initial weight to. You can see this one
[14:26] had to go check five times. So, I would
[14:28] probably add like 20 seconds to the
[14:29] initial weight. And now that it's done,
[14:31] let's go ahead and take a look at this
[14:33] final video. Today, I went to the store
[14:35] and guess what? They were out of eggs. I
[14:36] was so mad that I wanted to throw an
[14:38] egg, but I couldn't because they had no
[14:41] eggs. Okay. All right. So, that is a
[14:43] step by step of how to first of all
[14:45] create your avatar. You get your avatar
[14:46] ID, your voice ID, and you can make that
[14:48] request in NAND to automate what the
[14:50] avatar is going to say. Hopefully, this
[14:52] has sparked some ideas of what you can
[14:54] do to 10x your content game, scraping
[14:56] news, um you know, looking at Tik Tok
[14:58] trends, reading off different stories,
[14:59] automating different shorts. This is
[15:01] going to be super cool. And you can
[15:02] access this template that we covered
[15:04] right here in the video in my free
[15:06] school community. All you have to do is
[15:07] go to the link in the description and
[15:09] join the free school community. Once you
[15:11] get in there, this is what it's going to
[15:12] look like. All you have to do is click
[15:13] on YouTube resources and find the post
[15:14] associated with this video. Or if you
[15:16] can't find it, you can just search for
[15:17] the title of the video right up here.
[15:19] And then when you click into that video,
[15:21] there'll be a JSON file right here to
[15:23] download. And when you download that
[15:24] JSON file, you'll just have to open up a
[15:26] new workflow and end it in. Click import
[15:27] from file. And then you'll have that
[15:29] entire thing right here. It'll look like
[15:30] this. And then all you have to do is
[15:31] plug in your own avatar ID, your own
[15:33] voice ID, and the text that you want
[15:35] your avatar to read out. And if you
[15:37] enjoyed this video and you enjoyed this
[15:38] teaching style, then definitely check
[15:40] out my paid community. The link for
[15:41] that's also down in the description. Got
[15:42] a great community of over 1.8,000
[15:44] members who are building stuff with NAN
[15:47] every day. They're sharing stuff about
[15:48] their NN and their AI automation journey
[15:50] and it's just a really cool space to
[15:52] learn and collaborate. On top of that,
[15:53] we also have a full classroom section on
[15:55] a course called Agent Zero, which is
[15:56] like the foundations and then a course
[15:58] called 10 hours to 10 seconds where you
[15:59] learn how to identify, design, and build
[16:02] time-saving automations. And then we
[16:04] also have five live calls per week,
[16:05] which all of these are recorded if you
[16:06] can't make them, but we have like guest
[16:08] speakers, we have Q&As's, coffee chats,
[16:10] and tech support calls as well. So, I'd
[16:12] love to see you guys in those calls. But
[16:14] that's going to be it for this video.
[16:15] really appreciate you making it to the
[16:16] end of this one. And if you enjoyed or
[16:18] you appreciated it, learned something
[16:19] new, definitely give it a like. It helps
[16:21] me out a ton. And I'll see you guys in
[16:23] the next one.
