[00:00] Today, I'm going to show you guys
[00:01] exactly how I built this system so that
[00:02] I can auto post content on nine
[00:04] different social channels. I'm also
[00:05] going to give you guys all the resources
[00:07] that you need to set this up for free so
[00:08] that all you'll have to do is connect
[00:10] your own, you know, content and media
[00:12] that you want to upload and then just
[00:14] log into your own social accounts and
[00:15] you'll be all set up with auto posting.
[00:17] So, I don't want to waste any time here.
[00:18] Let's go ahead and break down the
[00:20] system. The first thing I want to show
[00:21] you guys is what are these weird looking
[00:24] pink nodes that you see? There's 10 of
[00:26] them here. Well, this is a platform
[00:27] called Blot. And as you can see here,
[00:29] what potato lets you do is create viral
[00:31] posts and faceless videos, but we're not
[00:33] going to be focusing on the content
[00:34] creation piece today. We're just talking
[00:36] about the actual auto posting piece. I
[00:38] don't know if you guys have had issues
[00:39] before posting on LinkedIn or YouTube
[00:41] and stuff like that through um like the
[00:44] other end native nodes or through an
[00:45] HTTP request or something, but makes it
[00:47] pretty easy. So anyways, when you go to
[00:49] potato and you sign up using the link in
[00:51] the description, make sure to use code
[00:52] Nate30 so you can get 30% off for 6
[00:54] months. I just wanted to say I'm not
[00:56] being paid by Botato to make this video.
[00:58] I've used Botato in different builds
[00:59] which I'll kind of feature at the end of
[01:01] this video. But yeah, it's just a great
[01:02] platform and I wanted to bring you guys
[01:04] this discount. And it's even easier now
[01:06] because in previous videos I've had to
[01:08] use an HTTP request like this and we had
[01:10] to set up all of these different like
[01:12] page IDs and everything in order to pass
[01:13] over the right pages to our, you know,
[01:17] different HTTP requests. But now because
[01:19] of the native node, it's super super
[01:20] easy. And if you don't see this verified
[01:22] Volt community node, you're going to
[01:24] have to go to your admin panel in your
[01:26] NADN instance and make sure that you
[01:28] have verified community nodes enabled
[01:30] and that you're updated to a recent
[01:32] enough version of NAND. Real quick, just
[01:34] to show you guys, I'm in my admin panel
[01:35] right now and you can see I have this
[01:37] turned on, which lets me access verified
[01:39] community nodes on NIAN cloud. Anyways,
[01:41] once you're here, you can see there's
[01:42] two actions. The first one is to upload
[01:44] media and then the second one is to
[01:46] create the post. So, I'll break down the
[01:48] difference here, but right here, this is
[01:49] where we're uploading media. And then
[01:50] over here, we're creating our posts on
[01:52] those nine different socials. So, the
[01:54] first thing we need to do before we can
[01:55] actually post is we need to create a
[01:57] Blot API key. And we need to sign into
[01:59] our social profiles that we actually
[02:01] want to post to. And then once I'm in
[02:02] Bot, I'm going to go to my settings in
[02:04] the bottom left. And all we have to do
[02:05] is start to add our accounts. So, let's
[02:08] say for the first example, we're just
[02:09] going to log in with Tik Tok and
[02:10] Instagram. All you do is click on the
[02:12] button, log in. Super easy. You can see
[02:14] I've connected other accounts down here.
[02:15] And then you're going to scroll up and
[02:17] go to your API and you'll copy your API
[02:19] key right here. And then after you copy
[02:21] that, you can go into potato and then
[02:22] open any of the potato nodes, create a
[02:24] new credential, and just paste your API
[02:26] key right there. And then you just have
[02:28] to make sure that all 10 of these potato
[02:30] nodes have that credential set up. And
[02:32] then because you already signed into
[02:33] like your Instagram and Tik Tok account
[02:35] on potato, all you have to do in this
[02:36] node is choose the right account from
[02:38] the list. So it really should be the
[02:39] only one there, but all you have to do
[02:41] now is choose the right account. And
[02:42] then you can see when you're posting on
[02:44] Tik Tok or Instagram, they're going to
[02:45] have different settings. So you have a
[02:47] privacy level. You can like disable
[02:48] comments. Is it AI generated? And all of
[02:51] these nodes are going to have different
[02:52] little levers and different filters to
[02:54] play with. But it's so much easier as a
[02:57] community node because in the old way we
[02:59] had to do like an HTTP request for all
[03:01] of them and they all had different like
[03:02] JSON body parameters to send over. So
[03:05] this is a lot easier now. Anyways, let
[03:07] me just show you guys an example of this
[03:08] in action. So, what I'm going to do is
[03:10] deactivate all of these nodes by just
[03:12] clicking on them and then clicking D.
[03:14] So, I'm turning these off because we
[03:15] only want to post to Instagram and Tik
[03:17] Tok. And what I'm going to do is hit
[03:19] execute workflow. So, what this is going
[03:20] to do is pull in our video as well as
[03:23] like our title and our caption from our
[03:25] Google sheet. It's going to upload that
[03:27] video to Blotato and then Blot is going
[03:29] to go ahead and create those posts on
[03:31] Instagram and Tik Tok as you can see.
[03:33] And then it goes back into our Google
[03:35] sheet that we're originally pulling from
[03:36] and it says, "Okay, this first row has
[03:38] now been posted." And keep in mind, this
[03:40] template is not the most robust error
[03:42] handling. It has one error set up right
[03:44] here to mark it off as errored. But if
[03:46] these notes error, it won't update. So
[03:47] just keep that in mind. But I just
[03:49] wanted to show you guys maybe a way you
[03:50] could think about error handling for
[03:51] this flow. But anyways, now that that's
[03:53] set up, what I can do is go back into my
[03:55] potato. I can go over here to published
[03:57] posts, and then these will pop through
[03:59] as published. So you can see this one
[04:01] already got posted on Tik Tok. And if we
[04:03] give this another minute, we'll see it
[04:05] on Instagram, too. And there you go. Now
[04:07] you can see we have our Glass Apple ASMR
[04:09] on both Instagram and Tik Tok. And if I
[04:11] click on one of them, it'll take us
[04:12] right to that actual post. So we can see
[04:14] that it is indeed there. Okay, so a lot
[04:17] just happened. Let's break it down one
[04:18] at a time. So the idea is that you could
[04:20] have this be an automation that goes off
[04:22] like every morning or something. And all
[04:24] you have to do is be in charge of
[04:26] filling up your database with posts. You
[04:28] could even pair this workflow with a
[04:30] different one that automatically creates
[04:31] the content and updates the sheet, which
[04:33] would be really powerful. But like I
[04:34] said, right now we're just focused on
[04:35] the posting. So, what happens is we have
[04:37] our title, we have our actual media, we
[04:40] have our caption, and then we have a
[04:41] status. And this can either be posted,
[04:43] ready to post, or aired. And this
[04:45] template you guys will also be able to
[04:46] access for free in my free school
[04:47] community. I'll show you later in the
[04:48] video how to set up all of it. Anyways,
[04:50] it's going to pull in the first row that
[04:52] says ready to post. And we can control
[04:54] that in this Google sheet where we
[04:56] basically say, okay, you're looking at
[04:57] this sheet. The status column has to
[04:59] equal ready to post. And we're only
[05:01] going to pull back the first matching
[05:03] row. And that's what we get over here.
[05:04] Because we don't want to pull back like
[05:06] six and post all six at a time. If you
[05:08] wanted to do six every day, the way I
[05:10] would do it is just have six different
[05:11] scheduled triggers to go off every 5
[05:13] minutes at like 6:00 a.m., 6:05, 6:10,
[05:16] something like that. Now, this next step
[05:18] only applies if you're holding your
[05:20] media files in Google Drive. And I
[05:22] figured a lot of you guys may be doing
[05:24] that and it's a little more complex. So
[05:25] I just wanted to set this up for you.
[05:27] And what we have to do is we have to
[05:28] extract the Google Drive file ID. So I
[05:31] have this already set up. Don't worry
[05:32] about it. If you use the Google sheet
[05:34] template, it'll match. And we get this
[05:35] file ID. And then we upload it to potato
[05:38] with this little different schema. So
[05:40] we're putting like this Google Drive
[05:41] URL. And then we're putting in that file
[05:43] ID that we just extracted. And that's
[05:45] how it works. If you're not using a
[05:47] Google Drive file, you won't have to do
[05:49] this. All you'll have to do is link in
[05:51] your own media URL, whether that's like
[05:52] a public URL or if it's binary data, you
[05:55] can just turn this on and then it will
[05:56] just grab the binary. So, super easy.
[05:59] But if you do use Google Drive, keep
[06:01] this step. And then from there, what
[06:02] happens is Botato basically says, "Okay,
[06:04] I see your video and I turn it into my
[06:06] own video. I don't add like a watermark
[06:08] or anything. I'm literally just copying
[06:10] it over so I can access it and then I'm
[06:13] going to post it on Instagram and Tik
[06:14] Tok for you." So, in these nodes, what
[06:16] you're going to set up is like, you
[06:17] know, text. So here I just basically put
[06:19] the title and the caption and then the
[06:21] actual Blot media URL. And of course we
[06:25] have other options that we could set up
[06:26] and each of these nodes is going to vary
[06:28] based on the platform but super simple.
[06:30] So they're really not too bad. I'm not
[06:32] going to dive into every single one
[06:33] because there's just different
[06:34] parameters. The one that is a little bit
[06:36] strange is when you go to Pinterest,
[06:38] what you have to do is you have to get a
[06:40] Pinterest board ID. And it's kind of
[06:42] weird the way you get it. It's not super
[06:43] intuitive. So here's an example
[06:45] Pinterest board. I would rightclick and
[06:47] go to inspect. And then I'm going to
[06:49] click on network up in the top. And then
[06:52] all I'm going to do is just refresh the
[06:53] page. Once that happens, I'm going to
[06:56] click on filter, type in capital B
[06:58] boards with an S, and then I'm going to
[07:00] click on that first row, and then just
[07:02] scroll up a little bit, and you should
[07:04] see this data object, and you're just
[07:06] looking for right here the ID. So I
[07:08] would basically just copy that, go back
[07:10] into the workflow, and then I would just
[07:12] put that right here in the Pinterest
[07:13] board section. And then that's how it
[07:15] knows which board in Pinterest to
[07:16] actually post on. But that's really the
[07:18] only weird thing. Some of these you may
[07:20] need to like verify your account before
[07:22] it lets you post through the API. So all
[07:24] you have to do is in this setup guide
[07:25] when you download this template, if you
[07:27] click on this little documentation here
[07:29] thing, it'll pull you up to social
[07:30] platform requirements and you can see
[07:32] guidelines for all of these different
[07:34] channels. And they also have a really
[07:35] cool AI search feature. So if you ask
[07:37] anything, it will basically search the
[07:39] documentation and help you out. So, like
[07:41] I said, I've used Botato before, but I
[07:43] used it before they dropped this
[07:45] verified community node. So, now it's a
[07:46] lot easier. Here's the example of the
[07:48] Glass ASMR videos that I did with Google
[07:50] V3. And you can see down here the
[07:52] posting to social section. We upload to
[07:54] Botato. And then from we upload to
[07:56] YouTube, Instagram, and Tik Tok. And
[07:58] here's another example where we
[07:59] automated not only the posting, but the
[08:01] content creation. And down here, you can
[08:03] see we use Blot to post once again on
[08:05] Instagram, Tik Tok, and YouTube. So,
[08:07] that's when this gets really powerful is
[08:08] when you're able to build a system that
[08:10] automates both parts of this so that all
[08:12] you have to do is just kind of like
[08:13] manually review if you're good with it.
[08:15] And then the content creation and the
[08:18] posting will be taken care of for you.
[08:19] So, in order to actually set all of this
[08:21] up for yourself, it's really, really
[08:22] easy. And when you download this
[08:23] template from my free school, you'll get
[08:25] a setup guide to make sure you're doing
[08:26] everything that you need to do. But, if
[08:28] you're not in my free school already,
[08:30] definitely join it because that's where
[08:31] you can get all of my templates that I
[08:32] show on YouTube for completely free. The
[08:34] link for that free school is down in the
[08:36] description. And once you get here, this
[08:37] is what it will look like. All you'll
[08:38] have to do is search for the title of
[08:40] the YouTube video. Or if you go to
[08:42] YouTube resources, you'll see here are
[08:43] all my videos and everyone has all of
[08:45] the resources there. So, for example, if
[08:47] this is the video you're looking for,
[08:48] you'll have a JSON file where you can
[08:50] download that and import that into Naden
[08:52] and then it will just pop up with this
[08:53] exact workflow. And then this Google
[08:55] sheet that I talked about, I made a copy
[08:57] of it. And all you have to do is make a
[08:58] copy of it as well. And you'll find the
[09:00] link to this Google sheet right here in
[09:01] the setup guide as well. So, all you
[09:03] have to do is click on this link right
[09:04] here, and it will prompt you to make a
[09:06] copy of that Google sheet. That way,
[09:08] your database will be set up the same
[09:09] way mine was, so that all the variables
[09:11] throughout this workflow will pass over
[09:12] correctly. And if you're looking to take
[09:14] your skills with Naden a little bit
[09:15] farther, then definitely check out my
[09:16] plus community. The link for that is
[09:18] also down in the description. Great
[09:19] community of members who are building
[09:20] with Naden every single day. And we also
[09:22] just announced monthly hackathons where
[09:24] we're going to be giving away thousands
[09:25] of dollars in prizes. And you don't even
[09:27] have to be an advanced automator. We
[09:29] have a beginner section as well. And
[09:31] we've got a full classroom section with
[09:32] two courses at the moment. We're always
[09:34] trying to build more, but right now we
[09:35] have agent zero, which is the
[09:37] foundations of AI automation, and then
[09:39] 10 hours of 10 seconds where you learn
[09:40] how to identify, design, and build
[09:42] time-saving automations. So, if any of
[09:44] that interests you at all, definitely
[09:45] check out the plus group. And I would
[09:47] love to see you guys in these
[09:48] communities. But that's going to do it
[09:49] for today. If you enjoyed the video or
[09:51] you learned something new, please give
[09:52] it a like. It definitely helps me out a
[09:54] ton. And as always, I appreciate you
[09:55] guys making it to the end of the video.
[09:57] See you on the next one. Thanks, guys.
