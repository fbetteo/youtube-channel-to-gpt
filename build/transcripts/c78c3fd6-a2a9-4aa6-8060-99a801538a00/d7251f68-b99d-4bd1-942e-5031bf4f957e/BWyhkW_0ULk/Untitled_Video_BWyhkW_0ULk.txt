[00:00] Here's how to use OpenAI's image API to
[00:02] save you 10 hours per week. So, this
[00:04] workflow right here, all I had to do was
[00:05] enter in ROI on AI automation, and it
[00:08] was able to spit out this LinkedIn post
[00:09] for me. And if you look at this graphic,
[00:11] it's insane. It looks super
[00:13] professional. It even has a little
[00:14] LinkedIn logo on the corner, but it
[00:16] directly calls out the actual statistics
[00:17] that are in the post based on the
[00:19] research. So, 74% AI initiatives meeting
[00:22] or exceeding ROI and 26% significant
[00:25] AIdriven gains. And for this next one,
[00:27] all I typed in was mental health within
[00:29] the workplace. And to spit out this
[00:30] post, according to Deote Insights,
[00:32] organizations that support mental health
[00:34] can see up to 25% increase in
[00:36] productivity. And as you can see down
[00:38] here, it's just a beautiful graphic.
[00:40] Anyways, let's do a quick live run of
[00:41] this workflow and then I'll walk through
[00:42] step by step how to set up this API
[00:44] call. Okay, so this form is waiting for
[00:46] us. I put in my email. I put the topic
[00:48] of morning versus night people and the
[00:50] target audience is working adults. So
[00:51] we'll hit submit, close out of here, and
[00:53] we'll see the LinkedIn post agent is
[00:54] going to start up. It's using Tavi here
[00:56] for research and it's going to create
[00:59] that post and that image prompt agent is
[01:01] going to read the post and basically
[01:02] create a prompt to feed into
[01:05] OpenAI's image generator. And as you can
[01:08] see, it's doing that right now. Okay, so
[01:09] all that just finished up. Let me pop
[01:11] over to email. So in email, we got our
[01:12] new LinkedIn post. Are you a morning
[01:14] lark or a night owl? The science of
[01:16] productivity. I'm not going to read
[01:17] through this right now exactly, but
[01:18] let's take a look at the image we got.
[01:20] When are you most productive? in the
[01:22] morning plus 10% productivity or night
[01:24] owls thrive in flexibility. I mean, this
[01:26] is insane. This is a really good
[01:27] graphic.
