[00:00] I just built an agent swarm that can do
[00:01] anything in N8N. Please find me four
[00:04] high performing YouTube videos about N8N
[00:06] and then send that as an email to Dexter
[00:09] Morgan. And then finally also let me
[00:11] know about the weather today in Chicago.
[00:13] All right, so I just sent that off and
[00:14] now our agent's basically going to get
[00:16] that transcribed audio and now it's
[00:18] going to decide between its five
[00:19] different agents which ones to call. So
[00:21] you can already see it finished up
[00:22] calling the web agent to get the
[00:24] weather. It called the contact agent to
[00:25] get Dexter Morgan's email address and
[00:28] now it's calling the YouTube agent in
[00:29] order to actually find YouTube videos
[00:31] that are high performing and about NN.
[00:33] And so that's the power of an agent
[00:34] swarm. This main orchestrator parent
[00:37] agent, all it has to do is understand,
[00:38] okay, I have five different agents.
[00:40] Which ones should I use? Rather than
[00:42] saying, okay, I have like 30 tools.
[00:44] Which tools do I use? And this framework
[00:46] makes our results more consistent and
[00:47] higher quality. And now that the agent
[00:49] has all it needs, it decides, okay, now
[00:51] I can call the email agent to send that
[00:53] email to Dexter Morgan. All right, so it
[00:54] just finished up. I got my Telegram
[00:56] message back, but I'm just going to pull
[00:57] it up on my desktop so you guys can see
[00:58] it as well. It said, I have found four
[01:00] high performing videos about NAND and
[01:02] sent them in an email to Dexter Morgan.
[01:04] When I hop over to my email, we can see
[01:05] that we just have one sent to
[01:07] dextermiami.com
[01:09] and it has four high performing videos
[01:11] about NAND. So that's awesome. It did
[01:12] what we wanted it to. It called the
[01:14] right agents, but not only did it do the
[01:16] right tasks, but it also logged
[01:18] everything so we can look and have full
[01:19] visibility. So that's exactly what's
[01:21] going on in this portion of the
[01:22] workflow. So if I head over to this
[01:23] Google sheet, you can see that we have
[01:25] the time of the run, we have the inputs,
[01:27] we have the outputs, we have the actions
[01:29] that were taken, and then also how many
[01:31] tokens were used up. You want to watch
[01:33] the full tutorial, click on that play
[01:34] button right here, and I'll see you guys
