[00:00] Here are 25 end hacks and I bet you
[00:01] don't know all of them. All right,
[00:02] starting off with number one. Hopefully
[00:04] we all know the difference between a
[00:05] fixed value and an expression value. And
[00:07] what you can see right here is that we
[00:08] have the word high and it's fixed. And
[00:09] typically if you wanted to make this an
[00:11] expression, you would have to come over
[00:12] here and hit expression. But what you
[00:13] can do is if something's fixed and
[00:14] before you start typing in there, you
[00:16] can just hit the equal sign on your
[00:17] keyboard and it will switch to an
[00:18] expression. Okay, number two is the
[00:19] ability to pin data. So let's say I'm
[00:21] running this perplexity search where I'm
[00:22] looking for what is naden. Once I got
[00:24] this output, this costed me money. So
[00:26] what I want to do is pin it. That way,
[00:27] when I want to run the workflow later, I
[00:29] don't have to resubmit another call to
[00:31] Perplexity's API or any API. This is
[00:33] really helpful for any nodes that are
[00:34] going to cost you money every time you
[00:36] run them or if they take a long time to
[00:38] run because now I have this data and
[00:39] let's say I want to map out the rest of
[00:40] the process. Now that it's pinned, I
[00:42] could basically and let me just steal
[00:43] this manual trigger real quick. I could
[00:45] basically continue to run this over and
[00:46] over and it's not going to make a new
[00:47] call to perplexity every time. And then
[00:49] we're able to use all of this data over
[00:51] here to continuously map out the
[00:52] different variables for the rest of the
[00:54] workflow. Number three is mock data. So
[00:55] we have the ability to basically set
[00:57] data within any sort of node or a
[00:58] trigger like this where I could click on
[01:00] this little pencil mark in the top and I
[01:02] could basically fill this in with data
[01:03] to test through the rest of the
[01:04] workflow. So this is very similar to
[01:06] pinning data where I could now say we're
[01:07] going to have a field called query. The
[01:08] value in there is going to be test and
[01:10] you can see it's pinned and now we can
[01:11] use this to map the rest of our process.
[01:13] This is especially useful when you're
[01:14] doing a when executed by another
[01:16] workflow trigger because then you don't
[01:17] have to use the main workflow to trigger
[01:19] this sub workflow every time you want to
[01:20] test it out. And another quick hack when
[01:22] it comes to pinning data is you can just
[01:23] click on the node and hit P to pin it or
[01:25] unpin it.
