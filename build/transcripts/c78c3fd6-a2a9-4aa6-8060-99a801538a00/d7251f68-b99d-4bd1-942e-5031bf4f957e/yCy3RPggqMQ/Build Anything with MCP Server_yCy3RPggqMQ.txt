[00:00] here's how you can build anything with
[00:01] mCP servers and NN all right so keep in
[00:03] mind there is zero prompting going on
[00:05] within the actual agent it just says you
[00:06] are a helpful assistant now I'm going to
[00:08] ask it to get Airbnb listings in Miami
[00:11] it's hitting airbnb's MPC server in
[00:13] order to understand okay what resources
[00:15] do I have what actions can I take what
[00:16] are the tool names and now it's hitting
[00:18] its execute tool in order to fill in the
[00:20] tool name and fill in the different
[00:21] parameters that it needs to pull back
[00:23] those listings that we're looking for so
[00:25] it should be finishing up any second now
[00:26] and we will be able to see these
[00:27] listings that we got there we go so we
[00:29] have here are some Airbnb listings in
[00:31] Miami Hunter 26 sailboat it gets us
[00:33] price information location all this kind
[00:35] of stuff if we click in here we should
[00:37] see an actual picture of Airbnb listing
[00:39] this is actually kind of just a boat but
[00:41] either way um we got five total here's a
[00:43] beautiful Suite in Miami which once
[00:44] again Airbnb Miami so because the agent
[00:47] was able to understand this is what I
[00:48] have access to and this is when I use
[00:50] each one I'm going to fill in my tool
[00:52] which is over here the tool I used is
[00:54] Airbnb search and I know that one of the
[00:56] parameters I need to fill out is the
[00:57] location which I will put Miami cool
[01:00] we're going to do one more quick example
[01:01] which is asking it to scrape Chipotle so
[01:03] sent that off it's going to hit fir
[01:05] craws mCP server this time in order to
[01:07] understand what actions do I have over
[01:09] here what can I do and now it's hitting
[01:10] the actual tool to take action for us
[01:12] and we should get back you know the the
[01:14] scrape results from chipotle.com I've
[01:16] scraped the main content from Chipotle
[01:17] homepage here's a summary we have new
[01:19] Chipotle honey chicken chipotle rewards
[01:21] menu highlights guacamole all this kind
[01:23] of stuff and then the execute tool is
[01:26] able to say okay in this case I need to
[01:27] scrape I need to use this URL I am going
[01:30] to format it and markdown and then we
[01:31] get our answer back here if you want to
