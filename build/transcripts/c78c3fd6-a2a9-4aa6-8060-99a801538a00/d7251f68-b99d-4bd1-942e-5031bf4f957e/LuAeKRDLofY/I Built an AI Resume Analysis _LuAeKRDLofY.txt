[00:00] Watch me build an AI resume screening
[00:01] system and edit in with no code. All
[00:03] right, so we know that the trigger of
[00:05] this workflow is going to be Gmail. So
[00:06] I'm going to type in Gmail. We're going
[00:08] to grab this guy and we're going to grab
[00:09] the trigger on message received. And I
[00:11] just sent myself an email with a resume
[00:13] from a fake character named Jordan
[00:15] Reeves. And it is a Word doc. We should
[00:17] see the binary image right here, which
[00:19] is Jordan Reeves resume as a Word doc.
[00:21] Okay. So the next thing to do is we want
[00:23] to have a switch that sends the data
[00:25] different ways based on the file type.
[00:27] So I'm going to add a new node. I'm
[00:29] going to type in switch. And what I'm
[00:31] going to do here is first of all, we're
[00:32] just going to worry about word docs
[00:34] because that's what we have right here.
[00:35] And then we'll come back later and do
[00:37] PDF and text file. Okay. So, we have the
[00:40] resume, we have the job title and
[00:42] description. Now, we want to feed it
[00:44] into an AI to analyze the two of them.
[00:47] So, I'm going to click on the plus and
[00:48] I'm going to add an AI agent.
[00:51] But before we can run this, we need to
[00:53] connect a brain. So, I'm going to click
[00:54] on the chat model button, and I'm just
[00:56] going to choose a OpenAI chat model
[00:58] because I want to use a reasoning model.
[01:01] You'll see that it's going to give us
[01:02] our strengths, weaknesses, all the stuff
[01:04] we asked for in different fields. And
[01:07] we'll be able to drag it later into
[01:08] Google Sheets really easily. So, there
[01:10] we go. It just finished up and now we
[01:11] have a list of candidate strengths. It
[01:13] found seven things. It found four
[01:15] weaknesses. It said low risk factor with
[01:17] an explanation, high reward factor, a
[01:20] nine overall rating, and a
[01:21] justification. If you want to watch the
