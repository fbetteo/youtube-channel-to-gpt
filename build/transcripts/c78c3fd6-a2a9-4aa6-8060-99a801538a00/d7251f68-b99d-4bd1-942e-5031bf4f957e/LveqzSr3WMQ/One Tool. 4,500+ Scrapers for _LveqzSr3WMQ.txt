[00:00] Here's the easiest way to scrape
[00:01] anything with Ampify. So Apify is like a
[00:03] marketplace for actors which essentially
[00:05] let us scrape anything on the internet.
[00:06] As you can see right here, we're able to
[00:08] explore 4,500 plus pre-built actors for
[00:10] web scraping and automation. And it's
[00:12] really not that complicated. An actor is
[00:13] basically just a predefined script that
[00:15] was already built for us that we can
[00:16] just send off a certain request to. So
[00:18] you can think of it like a virtual
[00:19] assistant where you're saying, "Hey, I
[00:20] want you to I want to use the Tik Tok
[00:22] virtual assistant and I want you to
[00:23] scrape, you know, videos that have the
[00:25] hashtag of AI content." Or you could use
[00:27] the LinkedIn job scraper and you could
[00:29] say, "I want to find jobs that are
[00:30] titled business analyst." So there's
[00:32] just so many ways you could use Appify.
[00:33] You could get leads from Google Maps.
[00:35] You could get Instagram comments. You
[00:36] could get Facebook posts. There's just
[00:38] almost unlimited things you can do here.
[00:40] You can even tap into Apollo's database
[00:41] of leads and just get a ton. So today,
[00:43] I'm just going to show you guys in Naden
[00:45] the easiest way to set up this Apify
[00:47] actor where you're going to start the
[00:49] actor and then you're going to just grab
[00:50] those results. So, what you're going to
[00:51] want to do is head over to Apify using
[00:53] the link in the description and then use
[00:54] code 30 Nate Herk to get 30% off. Okay.
[00:57] Like I said, what we're going to be
[00:58] covering today is a two-step process
[01:00] where you make one request to Aify to
[01:02] start up an actor and then you're going
[01:04] to wait for it to finish up and then
[01:05] you're just going to pull those results
[01:06] back in. So, let me show you what that
[01:07] looks like. What I'm going to do is hit
[01:09] test workflow and this is going to start
[01:10] the Google Maps actor. And what we're
[01:12] doing here is we're asking for dentists
[01:13] in New York. And then if I go to my
[01:15] Appify console and I go over here to
[01:17] actors and click on the Google Maps
[01:18] extractor one. If I click on runs, we
[01:20] can see that there's one currently
[01:21] finishing up right now. And now that
[01:23] it's finished, I can go back into our
[01:24] workflow. I can hook it up to the get
[01:26] results node. Hit test step. And this is
[01:28] going to pull in those 50 dentists that
[01:30] we just scraped in New York. And you can
[01:33] see this contains information like their
[01:34] address, their website, their phone
[01:36] number, all this kind of stuff. So you
[01:38] can just basically scrape these lists of
[01:40] leads. If you want to watch the full
[01:41] video, click on that play button right
[01:42] here. I'll see you guys over there.
