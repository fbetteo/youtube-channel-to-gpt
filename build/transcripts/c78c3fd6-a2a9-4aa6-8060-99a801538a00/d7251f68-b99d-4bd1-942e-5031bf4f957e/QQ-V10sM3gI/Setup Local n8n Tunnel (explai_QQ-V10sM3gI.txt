[00:00] Here's how to set up a Cloudflare tunnel
[00:01] so that your local NAND is publicly
[00:03] accessible. So right now we have our
[00:05] Docker container where we did the
[00:06] self-hosted AI starter kit with Nadn,
[00:08] Postgress, Quadrant, and Olama. And all
[00:10] of these apps and services are able to
[00:12] talk to each other because they're all
[00:13] in the same containerized environment
[00:15] right here. And so what happens is if we
[00:17] try to access something like Gmail from
[00:19] this container, we're going to get
[00:21] blocked right here by this firewall. And
[00:22] vice versa, if Gmail tries to talk to
[00:24] us, our NN instance, it's not going to
[00:26] be able to go through. Same thing with
[00:28] something like Telegram. So what we have
[00:29] to do is we have to drag in cloudflare
[00:31] here to basically create a tunnel and
[00:33] this is going to be some sort of you
[00:34] know actual public address. So right now
[00:36] we access our nodn instance through
[00:38] localhost 5678 which means only our
[00:41] local device right here where we
[00:42] installed everything can use it. But
[00:44] through Cloudflare, what we do is we set
[00:46] up some sort of public domain, which is
[00:47] going to be HTTPS. And then what happens
[00:50] is something like Telegram can send data
[00:51] to Cloudflare. And then our tunnel from
[00:53] Cloudflare is basically just going to be
[00:54] able to eat right through this wall and
[00:56] go talk to our Naden instance. If you
