[00:00] here are five AI agent Frameworks that
[00:01] you can start building with today first
[00:03] we have the parent agent framework this
[00:04] is where we have a main agent up top
[00:06] that we're able to send off tasks to
[00:07] different agents that are its child
[00:09] agents in this case the ultimate
[00:10] assistant has an agent called an email
[00:12] agent which looks like this and the
[00:13] email agent has tools that it's able to
[00:15] use to take action the next framework is
[00:17] called prompt chaining we want to use
[00:18] this when something's linear and we have
[00:19] the output from One agent going directly
[00:21] in as the input to the next agent and so
[00:23] on and so forth then we have routing
[00:24] where we have one agent up front who
[00:26] gets to decide which path to send the
[00:27] data Down based on how it's classified
[00:29] as you can see there's different routes
[00:30] for high priority customer support
[00:32] promotion or Finance then we have
[00:34] parallelization where we have data being
[00:36] sent different ways in this case we have
[00:37] three different agents that each focus
[00:39] on something different then at the end
[00:40] it's going to merge the outputs together
[00:42] and then pass it into one final agent
[00:44] who can create a comprehensive overview
[00:45] of everything that it was fed and
[00:47] finally my favorite framework we have
[00:48] the evaluator Optimizer framework where
[00:50] we have one agent feeding in data to an
[00:52] evaluator agent the agent decides if
[00:54] it's good or not if it's not good it
[00:55] gets sent to an Optimizer agent who is
[00:57] going to optimize the incoming text and
[00:59] this is going to be an endless loop
[01:00] until the evaluator agent decides okay
[01:03] this text is good to go if you want to
