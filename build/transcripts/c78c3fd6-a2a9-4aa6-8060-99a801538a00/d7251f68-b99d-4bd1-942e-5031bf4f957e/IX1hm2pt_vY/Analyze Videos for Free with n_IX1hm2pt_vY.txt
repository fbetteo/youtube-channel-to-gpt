[00:00] Here's how you can use AI Vision to
[00:01] analyze any YouTube video. Okay, so I'm
[00:03] going to go ahead and hit test workflow,
[00:04] which is going to open up this form
[00:05] that's going to prompt us to insert a
[00:07] video that we want to get analyzed. So,
[00:08] now that I've chosen my MP4 file, I'm
[00:10] going to submit that and then we'll
[00:11] watch this workflow kick off, which is
[00:13] basically going to upload that file to
[00:15] Google Gemini, and then it's going to
[00:16] analyze it. And you can see that it's
[00:17] going to wait for about 5 seconds, go
[00:19] check in on the status, and it looks
[00:21] like it is already done on that first
[00:23] try. So, it took under 5 seconds to
[00:25] analyze this video. And let's go take a
[00:27] look at what it says. So, here's the
[00:28] analysis that we just got back from
[00:29] Google. And what I'm going to do is just
[00:30] open up the full video right here, and
[00:32] we can see if it matches up. So, the
[00:34] video presents a series of artistic
[00:35] renderings where well-known beverage
[00:36] containers are reimagined as buildings
[00:38] or structures. Number one is a Coca-Cola
[00:40] bottle. The video begins with a tall
[00:41] Coke bottle-shaped building seemingly
[00:44] located in a city. The building has
[00:45] multiple floors, appears to be a
[00:46] restaurant or cafe. The exterior has a
[00:48] spiral staircase. So, as you can see,
[00:50] the description of the Coke bottle is
[00:51] super detailed. So, as you can see, we
[00:53] got a really detailed analysis on this
[00:54] video with four different parts. As you
[00:56] can see, four different drinks. And all
[00:58] of this was free of charge. If you want
[01:00] to watch the full video, click on that
[01:01] little play button right here.
