[00:00] By the end of this video, you'll have
[00:01] built your very own research AI agent
[00:03] without writing a single line of code.
[00:04] And I think you guys will be shocked at
[00:06] how simple it is to set up. I'm going to
[00:08] walk through the entire process with you
[00:09] guys step by step. All of the
[00:11] connections, all the credentials, all
[00:12] the tough stuff like that. I even went
[00:14] ahead and spun up a completely new edit
[00:15] account so I can do every single thing
[00:17] that you guys will do if you just got
[00:18] into. So, if that sounds good to you,
[00:20] let's get started. So, before we hop
[00:22] into NIDN and start building, I just
[00:23] wanted to real quick zoom out and tell
[00:25] you guys at a high level what we're
[00:26] doing today. So there are two services
[00:28] that we're going to have to access. The
[00:30] first one is Open Router. The second one
[00:31] is Perplexity. Open Router lets us
[00:33] connect to different AI models. So this
[00:35] is going to serve as the brain for our
[00:37] research agent. And then we're also
[00:38] going to connect to a tool called
[00:39] Plexity, which is kind of like a chatgbt
[00:42] research tool on steroids. So this is
[00:44] what's going to give our agent access to
[00:45] searching the internet in real time. So
[00:47] there's the brain for the AI agent.
[00:49] There's the tool the AI agent's going to
[00:50] use. And now, how are we going to
[00:52] communicate with the AI agent? In
[00:53] today's example, we are just going to
[00:55] send it a message via chat. And then it
[00:57] will basically do its research, use its
[00:59] brain, and then it will respond to us
[01:00] with some sort of research report. So
[01:02] that's how today's flow is going to
[01:04] work. But the cool thing is the trigger
[01:05] and the output don't have to be like
[01:07] this. Once we have built this agent, we
[01:08] could hook it up to whatever process we
[01:10] want. So maybe a new lead comes in and
[01:12] we want to research the lead. Or maybe
[01:13] every day we have a list of 10
[01:15] competitors and we want to research what
[01:16] they're doing. There's so many different
[01:17] ways that we can bake in a research
[01:19] agent into different flows. Okay, so now
[01:21] that that's out of the way, let's go
[01:22] into our Nitn. Let's open up a new
[01:24] workflow and let's get started with our
[01:26] research agent. Okay, so what I'm going
[01:28] to do is go ahead and click on this
[01:29] button in the middle that says add first
[01:30] step. And like I said, we just want to
[01:32] chat with our agent. So I'm going to
[01:34] choose down here on chat message. Now
[01:36] that we have our chat message set up in
[01:37] here, we could go ahead and open chat.
[01:39] And this is where we can go ahead and
[01:40] type and talk to our AI agent and it
[01:42] will get our message. So the next step
[01:44] is we're going to click on this plus
[01:45] after that chat trigger. And I'm going
[01:47] to type in AI agent and pull one of
[01:50] these guys in here. And now we're going
[01:51] to go and connect that first thing that
[01:52] I talked about which is open router in
[01:54] order to give our AI agent a brain. So
[01:56] right here, chat model, I'm going to
[01:58] click on the plus. And at the bottom
[02:00] over here, I'm going to choose open
[02:01] router chat model. Once I open this up,
[02:03] you can see that it prompts us to
[02:04] connect a credential. And we currently
[02:06] don't have one. And if I click on create
[02:07] new credential, it asks us for an API
[02:09] key. An API key is basically just a
[02:11] fancy word for password. So what I'm
[02:13] going to do is open up a new tab. I'm
[02:15] going to type in open router. And we are
[02:17] going to go to open router.ai. You
[02:19] probably don't have an account set up.
[02:20] So, if you don't, go ahead and sign up.
[02:21] And then what we're going to do is go
[02:23] over to our profile and we're going to
[02:25] go to keys. So, all I have to do now is
[02:27] click on create API key. I can name this
[02:29] one, you know, whatever you want. I'm
[02:31] just going to call this research agent.
[02:32] And now I'm going to click on create.
[02:34] So, this gives us our unique ID or a
[02:36] password. And we're going to copy this.
[02:38] And you want to store this somewhere
[02:39] else because it's not going to show it
[02:41] again. And now that I've copied this
[02:42] key, I can go back into edit end and I
[02:44] can paste it in right here. Once we've
[02:45] dropped that in, I'm going to hit save.
[02:47] And we should go green. connection
[02:48] tested successfully. So now we are able
[02:50] to have our NN AI agent talking to Open
[02:53] Router and using that brain based on the
[02:55] chat model that we choose. But real
[02:56] quick, let's hop back into Open Router
[02:58] so I can just explain something. First
[02:59] of all, if you go up here to your
[03:01] credits, this is basically how much
[03:03] money you have in your Open Router
[03:04] account. And if you don't have credits
[03:06] in there, you're not going to be able to
[03:07] use this AI model as a brain. And then
[03:09] the second thing is you want to keep
[03:11] your API key secret because if someone
[03:13] else plugs in your API key, they're
[03:15] going to be able to eat up at your
[03:16] credits that you're paying for. So, just
[03:18] keep that in mind. But now that we've
[03:19] connected to Open Router, I can choose
[03:21] from a ton of different chat models. As
[03:22] you can see, we have OpenAI's models, we
[03:24] have Perplexity models, we have Quen, we
[03:25] have Enthropic, we have Google. There's
[03:28] tons of models in here. Right now, I'm
[03:29] going to keep it at GPT4.1 Mini, which
[03:31] is a really good balance of cheap but
[03:33] also powerful. So, I'm just going to
[03:34] stick with that for now. Cool. So, we
[03:36] have our brain set up. What we could do
[03:37] is just talk to our agent, and we can
[03:39] see that it's going to use AI. So, if I
[03:40] just open up chat real quick and I said,
[03:42] explain the rules of golf. When I send
[03:44] that off, it's going to be able to use
[03:45] an AI model in order to actually
[03:47] understand what I'm asking it and
[03:49] explain back the rules of golf. So,
[03:51] here's what it answered with. I'm not
[03:52] going to read all of it, but it gave us
[03:53] an objective, which is to get the ball
[03:55] in the hole in as few strokes as
[03:57] possible. It's going to give us some
[03:58] basic rules, and then it goes into
[03:59] penalties and a summary. So, anyways,
[04:01] we've validated that our AI brain is
[04:03] working. Now, we need to add our
[04:05] research tool. So, I'm going to click on
[04:07] this plus button right under tool, and
[04:09] I'm just going to search for perplexity.
[04:11] I'm going to click on perplexity tool
[04:13] right here. And once again, we have to
[04:14] go get a credential and get some sort of
[04:17] password. So, I'll click on this, click
[04:18] on create new credential, and once
[04:20] again, it prompts us for an API key. So,
[04:22] I'm going to open up a new tab and I'm
[04:23] going to go to perplexity.ai.
[04:25] And I already have an account set up. If
[04:27] you don't have one, you're going to want
[04:28] to go ahead and sign up for an account
[04:29] real quick. It's going to be very
[04:31] similar. You're going to go down to the
[04:32] bottom left into your settings. Now that
[04:33] I'm in my settings, I'm going to go on
[04:35] this lefth hand side down to API keys.
[04:37] And here you can see I already have a
[04:38] key. But what you're going to do is
[04:39] click on create key. And now it's just
[04:41] going to pop up a new one. So just keep
[04:43] in mind every service you're going to
[04:44] use is probably just going to give you
[04:45] your API key a little bit differently,
[04:47] but it's generally going to be the same.
[04:49] So I'm going to go ahead and copy this
[04:50] key. I'm going to go into Nitn, paste it
[04:52] in right here. And when I hit save, it
[04:54] should say connection tested
[04:55] successfully. Down here it says
[04:57] credential successfully created. And
[04:59] there we go. It says connection tested
[05:00] successfully. So we're set up to
[05:02] perplexity as well. And same thing with
[05:03] Plexity. When you're in here, you want
[05:05] to go to your API billing and you're
[05:07] going to have to have some sort of
[05:08] credit balance in here. Otherwise, it's
[05:10] not going to be able to actually search
[05:12] the web. So, now that we have perplexity
[05:14] connected, we have a few things to
[05:15] choose from. So, first of all, we have a
[05:17] model. And you can see we have R1, we
[05:19] have Sonar, Sonar Deep Research, Sonar
[05:21] Pro, Sonar Reasoning, Sonar Reasoning
[05:23] Pro. So, these are just different
[05:25] perplexity models that affect the, you
[05:27] know, basically the depth and the
[05:28] quality of the research that we're going
[05:30] to do based on which one we choose.
[05:32] They're also all going to be a little
[05:33] bit different with their pricing. Okay,
[05:35] so I went to Google and I searched
[05:36] perplexity API documentation and I'm
[05:38] going to click on this first link right
[05:40] here. Now all I have to do is come up
[05:42] here and click on models and this is
[05:43] going to show us those different models
[05:44] that we just saw in N&N. So we can see
[05:46] if we want to do some basic search we
[05:48] can use these search models which are
[05:50] sonar pro or sonar. If we want to do
[05:52] some research we can use sonar deep
[05:54] research. And if we want to do reasoning
[05:56] we can do sonar reasoning pro or sonar
[05:58] reasoning. Based on the use case you'll
[06:00] kind of come in here and you'll choose
[06:01] which type of you know model you want to
[06:02] use. Let's say for now we want to do
[06:04] some in-depth analysis and let's do
[06:06] sonar deep research. So I would just
[06:08] come back and end it in and I would
[06:10] choose sonar deep research. And now I'm
[06:12] just going to set up a user message
[06:13] which is basically just you know if we
[06:15] were searching and doing research right
[06:18] now what would we type into Google? And
[06:20] what's really cool about this is the AI
[06:21] agent is going to be smart enough to
[06:23] know what it would type in. So all I
[06:25] have to do is click on this button right
[06:26] here which says let the model define
[06:27] this parameter. I can click on that. And
[06:30] now the AI agent is going to
[06:31] automatically fill this in right here
[06:32] based on the way we interact with it.
[06:34] I'm not going to go too in depth of what
[06:36] all these mean. If you want to see a
[06:37] video about that, check that out right
[06:38] here. But at the bottom, you can see
[06:40] that we can do like a search recency
[06:41] filter. So we could say, "Hey, I only
[06:43] want to look at stuff from today or from
[06:44] the past hour." So you can get really
[06:46] customized with these results. And you
[06:48] could also, if you wanted to, look for
[06:49] only certain domains. So you could put
[06:51] in the domains that you want to research
[06:53] and make sure you know exactly where
[06:55] your information is coming from. But
[06:56] anyways, I'm going to get rid of these
[06:58] two options for now, and we're just
[06:59] going to go ahead and try off a search.
[07:01] So, I'm gonna hit save, and then I'm
[07:02] gonna ask it a question. And before we
[07:04] send off this query, I just wanted to
[07:05] call out one more thing, which is the
[07:06] fact that our AI agent does not have a
[07:08] system message. The system message by
[07:10] default is you are a helpful assistant.
[07:12] Typically, when you have an AI agent in
[07:14] Nen, you want to give it specific
[07:16] instructions on, you know, you're an
[07:17] expert research agent. You have this
[07:19] tool to do research, you're going to do
[07:21] all this. And right now I just want to
[07:22] show you guys how quick and easy it is
[07:24] to set up an agent and how smart it is
[07:26] by default without even prompting it. So
[07:28] once we did system prompt it, it would
[07:30] get much much smarter. So I'm going to
[07:32] send off this very broad question where
[07:34] I said, "How can I optimize my sleep?"
[07:36] We're going to see that it's smart
[07:37] enough to use Perplexity. Right now it's
[07:39] doing its deep research using sonar deep
[07:42] research. And I'll check back in with
[07:44] you guys when we get that report about
[07:46] how to optimize sleep. All right, so
[07:48] that just finished up. And keep in mind,
[07:49] if you're doing deep research, it's
[07:50] going to take a little longer than if
[07:51] you do more of a basic web search. But
[07:53] as you can see, we basically have this
[07:54] full report right here where it's
[07:56] telling us things like temperature or,
[07:58] you know, what you can do before bed in
[08:00] order to maintain a consistent sleep
[08:01] schedule, um, different relaxation
[08:03] routines, diet, exercise, all this kind
[08:06] of stuff. And if we click into the
[08:07] Plexity tool, we can basically see all
[08:09] of the different sources that it used.
[08:11] So you can see here it searched through
[08:13] 20 sources. And yes, I know it says 19,
[08:16] but computers start counting at zero. So
[08:18] that's 20 sources. And because we can
[08:19] see that it used these 20 sources to
[08:21] give us this report, we could system
[08:23] prompt the AI agent and say, "Always
[08:25] give me citations of every single fact
[08:27] to where you found it from." So
[08:28] hopefully you can see how much quicker
[08:30] this is going to allow you to do
[08:31] research. So anyways, that's super cool.
[08:33] I want to show you guys a different
[08:34] example of maybe something you could do
[08:36] if you don't want to just have research
[08:37] by talking to this AI agent every time.
[08:39] All right, so what I'm going to do is
[08:40] get rid of this chat message trigger.
[08:42] I'm going to add a Google sheet. And I'm
[08:45] not going to go over the Google sheet
[08:46] credentials right now. If you want to
[08:47] see a video, I'll tag that right up
[08:48] here. This example I just want to set up
[08:49] real quick to show you guys the power of
[08:51] how you can use this research agent once
[08:53] you've set it up. So, I'm going to
[08:54] connect to my sheet real quick, which is
[08:55] basically this sheet of competitors. So,
[08:57] we've got Apple, Nvidia, Google, and
[08:59] Amazon. And every day, this can go off
[09:01] and it can do research about what
[09:02] they're up to in the past week or
[09:04] something like that. So, what you could
[09:05] even do is switch out this manual
[09:07] trigger for a schedule trigger so that
[09:09] this could run every single day at
[09:10] midnight and then you'll wake up to
[09:12] fresh insights and research about your
[09:14] competitors. So, I pulled in my four
[09:16] competitors. As you can see on the right
[09:18] hand side, we have the four. And then
[09:20] all I have to do is make sure the agent
[09:21] can actually look at them because the
[09:23] agent right now was just set up to look
[09:25] at the connected chat trigger node,
[09:26] which no longer exists. So, I would
[09:29] change this user message to define
[09:30] below. And all I'd have to do is drag in
[09:32] the competitor from that left-hand side
[09:34] into this user message right here. So,
[09:36] now it will be looking at Apple. And
[09:38] here's where we can add a system
[09:39] message. And this is a really concise
[09:41] example just to show you guys. I said,
[09:42] "You are an expert research agent. You
[09:44] will be given the name of a competitor,
[09:46] which is up here, the user message, and
[09:48] you will use your perplexity tool to do
[09:50] the research about them and summarize
[09:51] what they've been up to so that we can
[09:53] stay ahead of them. So, what I can do is
[09:54] go ahead and hit execute step. This is
[09:56] going to do research about all four
[09:58] competitors, not just one of them. So,
[09:59] it's going to do Apple, Google, Amazon,
[10:01] and Nvidia. And then once we get that
[10:03] research report back, we will be able to
[10:05] write it back to that Google sheet.
[10:07] Okay. So, that just finished up, and now
[10:09] we have deep research done on our four
[10:10] competitors. So, if I click into the AI
[10:12] agent, let's move this thing over to the
[10:13] side a little bit. You can see here is
[10:15] our research about Apple, here's our
[10:17] research about Nvidia, here's the
[10:18] research about Google, and then here is
[10:20] Amazon. Now, all I'd have to do is add
[10:23] another node to write that all back into
[10:25] our Google sheet. And I can just do this
[10:27] by dragging the output of the AI agent
[10:29] into the new column called findings. And
[10:31] if I hit run on this node, it's going to
[10:33] write it all back into our Google sheet.
[10:35] And we'll go take a look over there. So,
[10:36] here's the sheet that we pulled from. We
[10:38] have Apple with the findings about
[10:39] Apple, Nvidia with the findings about
[10:41] Nvidia, and so on for Google and Amazon.
[10:43] So, I know I went through this example
[10:44] quick, but I just wanted to show you the
[10:46] power of being able to every single day,
[10:48] you know, you could research 10
[10:49] companies, 10 different tools, whatever
[10:51] it is. You can do deep research, you can
[10:53] do quick research, you can do whatever
[10:54] you want with Perplexity, and the agent
[10:56] will then process all the data that it
[10:57] got from Perplexity. And it could even
[10:59] site and show you all the sources where
[11:01] it got its information from. So, it's
[11:03] more than just being able to send the
[11:04] agent a text message and have it do
[11:06] research for you because realistically,
[11:08] you could just go Google something
[11:09] yourself. It's about writing in-depth
[11:11] research reports where you prompt it on
[11:12] here's the structure I want. I want all
[11:14] the sources at the bottom. It's about
[11:15] baking in a research agent like this
[11:17] into a different process that already
[11:19] exists like something in your sales
[11:20] pipeline or something in your, you know,
[11:22] marketing pipeline. So, if you're
[11:24] interested in learning about different
[11:25] use cases and how you can actually get a
[11:26] process from your mind onto an edit in
[11:28] Canvas like this, then definitely check
[11:30] out my community. The link for that is
[11:31] down in the description. The goal of
[11:33] this community is to take you from a
[11:34] complete beginner to building your first
[11:35] AI automation for you or for your
[11:37] business or for another business. We've
[11:39] got a great community of members here
[11:40] who are automating things every day with
[11:42] nodn, sharing their resources, sharing
[11:44] their problems, sharing their solutions.
[11:46] And it's really cool because everyone is
[11:48] as obsessed with AI automation as you
[11:49] probably are. We've also got two full
[11:51] courses. The first one is agent zero,
[11:53] which is the foundations of a
[11:54] automation. So, if you are a complete
[11:56] beginner, you can start here and then
[11:57] you'll move into 10 hours to 10 seconds
[11:59] where you learn how to identify, design,
[12:01] and build time-saving automations. We've
[12:03] also got step-by-step builds, end
[12:05] templates, and live calls. So, if you
[12:07] can't make them live, you can also watch
[12:09] the recordings and make sure you're
[12:10] always staying up to date. Anyways, I'd
[12:12] love to see you guys in this community.
[12:13] It's a really fun environment. But that
[12:15] is going to do it for this video. If you
[12:17] guys enjoyed, learned something new,
[12:18] please give it a like. It definitely
[12:19] helps me out a ton. And if you enjoyed
[12:21] this style of teaching, then definitely
