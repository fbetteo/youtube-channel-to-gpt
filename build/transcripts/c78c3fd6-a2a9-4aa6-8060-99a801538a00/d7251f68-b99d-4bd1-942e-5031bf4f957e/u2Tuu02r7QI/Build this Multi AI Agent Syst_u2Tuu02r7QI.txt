[00:00] so right here we have a Content creation
[00:01] database where we input a campaign name
[00:04] a subject and a target audience and then
[00:06] this agentic workflow right here will
[00:07] take these three things and make very
[00:09] tailored LinkedIn posts X posts and blog
[00:12] posts like I said based on the
[00:13] information that we provide so in this
[00:15] demo we'll be looking at the campaign of
[00:17] open AI news the subject is recent news
[00:20] about open Ai and then the target
[00:21] audience is AI enthusiasts so we'll come
[00:23] in here we'll hit test step and then we
[00:26] will come back into um the database and
[00:29] watch this happen it's going to generate
[00:31] all three of these posts for us that are
[00:32] going to be very tailored towards AI
[00:34] enthusiasts as you can see it's
[00:35] finishing up the blog right now and then
[00:36] we'll take a look at what comes back in
[00:38] our Google sheet so here comes the
[00:40] LinkedIn post um let me just expand this
[00:42] real quick so LinkedIn post as you can
[00:43] see it's it's very optimized for mobile
[00:45] it has emojis it's very um professional
[00:48] but also friendly it ends with a call to
[00:50] action and hashtags for the X poost it's
[00:52] a lot shorter more concise and it also
[00:54] ends with a call to action and for the
[00:56] blog post we get sort of a more
[00:58] structured two paragraph BL blog and
[01:00] obviously you can change the way that
[01:01] the stuff comes back based on the way
[01:02] you prompt it but that's a quick demo of
[01:05] how this content creator agent works it
[01:07] you know takes our our um subject it
[01:09] automatically does research it goes and
[01:11] gets recent information and then it's
[01:12] going to form those posts so let's get
[01:15] into this actual build all right so
[01:16] here's the workflow we'll be breaking
[01:18] down today um as you saw in the demo
[01:20] basically you're going to put in
[01:21] information within a Google sheet or
[01:22] some sort of database airtable could
[01:24] work great too where you're telling the
[01:25] agent okay this is the campaign this is
[01:27] what I want you to search for and I want
[01:29] you to tailor your posts towards this
[01:31] sort of target audience so that's what's
[01:33] going on in the git campaign so real
[01:35] quick let's come in here and we'll walk
[01:37] through an example happening live so for
[01:39] campaign let's do
[01:41] um let's do food Trends we will do
[01:46] recent Trends in the food service
[01:50] industry and then target audience we
[01:52] will just
[01:53] do um small business owners so not sure
[01:56] that exactly is all cohesive but this is
[01:59] the example we're looking at and we'll
[02:01] see what we get back so we'll load this
[02:03] into nadn so we'll just test this step
[02:06] to get the campaign information we got
[02:09] the four items back so we're just
[02:10] limiting it to one also one thing I want
[02:11] to mention is um at the end of the video
[02:13] we're going to change this up so it's
[02:14] actually a Google Sheets trigger so you
[02:16] don't have to test everything we'll make
[02:18] it an active workflow and then that way
[02:19] when you type in information in your
[02:21] content creation database the workflow
[02:23] will just take place automatically but
[02:25] for testing purposes and to see
[02:26] everything visually happen we want to do
[02:28] it manually so we can see no by node
[02:30] understand what's going on in each one
[02:32] so anyways we got the information here
[02:33] and now we're limiting it to just that
[02:35] last row so we're getting the campaign
[02:37] um as you can see food Trends recent
[02:39] Trends in the food service industry and
[02:41] then target audience of small business
[02:42] owners and then later it's going to fill
[02:44] in the LinkedIn the X and the blog post
[02:45] for
[02:46] us so next what we're doing is we're
[02:49] just setting up the field so I'll run
[02:50] this real quick we're we're setting a
[02:52] query and a target audience so obviously
[02:54] that stuff is coming from right here and
[02:56] we want um the query is the content
[02:58] subject so whatever you type in that
[02:59] subject is what we're going to have
[03:01] tavali is what we're using for our
[03:03] searching but tavali is going to be
[03:05] searching with this query of recent
[03:06] Trends in the food service industry so
[03:08] we're just setting that and we're doing
[03:09] the same thing with target audience um
[03:11] it's coming from here obviously but we
[03:12] want to set it
[03:13] here and then we're getting into our
[03:15] actual HTTP request so in this HTTP
[03:19] request that's where we're feeding in
[03:20] this information to actually get article
[03:22] information back so we're using tavali
[03:24] so I have the URL right here for tavali
[03:26] tavali is a super cool sort of you know
[03:28] third party API um search engine where
[03:31] it's really really tailored towards llms
[03:33] rag AI agents um as you can see here
[03:35] search HPI API fast accurate results
[03:38] reducing hallucination so something I've
[03:39] been playing around with and it's super
[03:40] cool anyways so we're just connecting to
[03:43] tavali um through their documentation
[03:45] and we're sending over this Json body so
[03:48] in here obviously you put in your API
[03:50] key we put in the query which as you saw
[03:52] from earlier was recent Trends in the
[03:53] food service industry and then just some
[03:55] other parameters you'll be able to
[03:56] configure this stuff in here but we're
[03:57] looking for news so it's going to be
[03:59] looking for recent information which is
[04:01] super cool especially when you're
[04:02] wanting to make posts on LinkedIn and x
[04:05] and all this kind of stuff that's very
[04:06] recent and has obviously information
[04:08] from the past couple days or weeks
[04:11] rather than last month last two months
[04:14] so anyways that's how we configure this
[04:16] and it's looking for our query like I
[04:18] said so I'll hit test step and while
[04:19] this is running I just wanted to say
[04:21] this whole workflow right here will be
[04:22] available for download in my free school
[04:24] Community Link for that will be down in
[04:25] the description and then if you want to
[04:27] check out my paid community and want to
[04:29] dive deeper into AI automations real use
[04:31] cases and um five weekly calls then
[04:33] check out the paid Community like I said
[04:35] and then finally if you want me to build
[04:37] out some sort of automation like this or
[04:38] you're looking for consultancy services
[04:40] and check out my website link for that
[04:41] will also be down in the description but
[04:43] anyways if we switch over here to Json
[04:45] we can see what's coming back so we got
[04:47] three different articles as you can see
[04:48] we got three URLs we're getting the raw
[04:50] content from these articles and then
[04:51] we're getting the title and then we're
[04:53] also getting information on when these
[04:54] were published so all of these were
[04:55] published today December 2nd so you know
[04:58] you're getting accurate real time
[05:00] information so once we're getting that
[05:03] information back from tavali we're just
[05:05] pretty much organizing the data real
[05:06] quick so we're splitting it out so that
[05:08] we're getting it um so we can then
[05:10] aggregate it so now we have it all sort
[05:12] of in one item with the three different
[05:14] raw contents and titles of the Articles
[05:17] so from here we're feeding it into three
[05:18] different agents so the first one is
[05:20] going to be specialized in LinkedIn so I
[05:22] won't dive too deep into these prompts
[05:24] um like I said the workflows will be
[05:25] linked in the um free school Community
[05:28] available for download so you'll be to
[05:29] check out all this kind of stuff on your
[05:31] own but basically what we're doing is
[05:33] we're feeding each of these agents the
[05:35] article content and then we're feeding
[05:37] it the um Target audiences and actually
[05:40] what I want to do is in the demo and in
[05:41] the previous ones I've done tools agents
[05:44] we're going to switch these to
[05:45] conversational just to see how that
[05:46] works because as you can see they don't
[05:47] have any tools they're pretty much um
[05:50] this might be better for making things
[05:52] sound more human-like they're taking
[05:53] some information and then structuring it
[05:55] in a way based on you know how we prompt
[05:57] it so we'll try conversational agent and
[06:00] um let's hit this off and then let's
[06:01] look at the prompts real quick so
[06:02] basically all I'm saying is oh jeez okay
[06:05] great reminder if you switch the type of
[06:07] Agent The Prompt will disappear so
[06:09] anyways we'll run this again um we
[06:11] changed it to conversational agent from
[06:12] a tools agent and also one thing I
[06:14] wanted to mention is originally I tried
[06:15] this with grock because grock's a lot
[06:17] cheaper we're using foral mini in this
[06:19] case as you can see using foral mini but
[06:21] grock had an issue with the Emojis and I
[06:23] wanted emojis back to separate headers
[06:25] and stuff so we got this LinkedIn post
[06:27] so elevate your small business with
[06:28] plant-based innovation
[06:30] as we wrap up 2024 the demand for PL
[06:31] plant-based options is booming
[06:33] Innovative ingredients um as you can see
[06:35] it ends with a call to action what
[06:37] plant-based Innovations are you excited
[06:38] to try in your business share below so
[06:40] it's tailored towards small businesses
[06:42] um and then we get some hashtags too so
[06:44] it's a simple prompt you'll be able to
[06:45] check out yourself and then from there
[06:46] we feed it in to the X agent so this
[06:49] prompt is tailored towards making things
[06:51] um posts optimized for x and as you can
[06:53] see in here we're giving it the article
[06:55] content and the target audience from
[06:57] previously and we need to do the same
[06:59] thing here here we're referencing the
[07:00] article content once again in the same
[07:02] Target audiences so small Biz owners
[07:04] ready to harness data to drive growth
[07:06] pour my beers self poort Tech not only
[07:08] elevates customer experience but offers
[07:10] key insights into preferences and Trends
[07:11] optimize your offerings and boost today
[07:13] so um simple prompt for a shorter X
[07:16] poost and then finally we'll go into the
[07:19] blog writer we'll run this and same
[07:23] thing we're giving it target audience
[07:24] and article content and it should be
[07:26] very tailored towards um small business
[07:28] owners it's going to be about I told it
[07:30] about a two paragraph as you can see
[07:31] right here it cuts with the two with the
[07:33] line breaks but a two paragraph um
[07:35] informative blog so I'm not going to
[07:36] read through this whole thing but as you
[07:38] can see it's a little more formal
[07:39] there's no Emojis and that's how that
[07:41] works from there we're just feeding back
[07:42] the three posts back into that same row
[07:44] where we initially created the campaign
[07:47] um you know this is where you could
[07:48] route them out to actually automatically
[07:50] post but I think I like the idea of
[07:52] having it put back into a database for
[07:53] just some manual human intervention that
[07:55] way you could maybe attach a few
[07:57] relevant images or um change some
[08:00] grammar if you didn't like some way the
[08:01] Emojis came back or something like that
[08:03] but all we're doing is we are matching
[08:04] on the column name of campaign so we
[08:06] grab the campaign from the original node
[08:09] that got The Campaign just so we're
[08:10] aligning the rows correctly and then we
[08:12] just fed in for the column LinkedIn the
[08:14] linked post for X the X post and then
[08:16] for the blog the blog post so if we hit
[08:19] test step switch back over to content
[08:20] creation we'll see these pop in here
[08:24] there we go so we just got our LinkedIn
[08:25] post our X poost and then our blog um so
[08:28] that's pretty much how that works and
[08:29] now what we're going to do is just set
[08:31] up the um what's it called the Google
[08:34] Sheets trigger that way when you come in
[08:35] and create a campaign you don't have to
[08:37] come back and end it and hit test
[08:38] workflow it'll just all happen for you
[08:40] okay so first thing we're going to do is
[08:42] we're going to delete this delete this
[08:44] and we can get rid of our limit we're
[08:46] going to now make a sheets node a
[08:49] trigger on row added so when the row is
[08:52] added we're obviously going to be
[08:54] pulling from that same document content
[08:57] creation same sheet sheet one row added
[09:01] and then we'll just hit test
[09:02] step and so this will pull back all of
[09:05] the rows so as you can see we got
[09:06] everything back here um let's just real
[09:08] quick connect this guy into there and
[09:10] then all we need to do is update the
[09:12] update node because otherwise it's not
[09:14] going to know where to fill it back into
[09:16] so what we want to do is reference the
[09:19] Google Sheets trigger node we'll be
[09:21] looking for item not item matching we
[09:25] looking for item. json. um campaign
[09:29] because that's the actual thing that
[09:30] we're using to match of course and that
[09:33] should pretty much be it all right
[09:34] workflow is now active we're going to
[09:35] come into content creation database past
[09:37] in our new campaign um there we go
[09:39] Christmas deals is the name it's
[09:41] searching for best deals as Christmas
[09:43] and then it's going to be targeted
[09:44] towards parents as far as our our post
[09:46] go so we'll come into the actual content
[09:48] creation we'll go to executions and
[09:50] we'll just wait here because as you can
[09:51] see um the execution node is going to be
[09:54] pulling every minute so we'll wait here
[09:56] for the execution and then we'll hop
[09:57] into the database and see what we get
[09:58] okay just got the execution back as you
[10:00] can see it just started so we'll hop
[10:02] into the database and we should be
[10:03] getting back our three content posts any
[10:06] second now okay here they just popped
[10:08] through we've got um the first LinkedIn
[10:10] post is holiday shopping alert for
[10:11] parents as you can see we've got Apple
[10:13] airpods Pro Apple airpods Pro um
[10:16] decorations Home Essentials and we've
[10:18] got some more information here Cyber
[10:20] Monday score big you can get airpods Pro
[10:22] 2 nearly 40% off and then we've got our
[10:25] blog about once again it comes back with
[10:27] apple airpods Pro and other information
[10:30] here so that's pretty much how this one
[10:31] works um so that's all I've got for this
[10:34] one a couple ways you could expand off
[10:35] this build for example you could have
[10:37] this be a chat interface where you talk
[10:38] to the agent and then it fills in your
[10:40] campaign and then it pulls from your
[10:41] campaign to do the searching and the
[10:43] posting you can obviously completely
[10:45] automate the posting but I like to have
[10:46] a little bit of manual touch point in
[10:48] there and then maybe something else cool
[10:49] is you could call some sort of third
[10:51] party API in order to add some sort of
[10:53] visual elements to your post which could
[10:55] be another cool way to just make this
[10:57] stuff smarter and cooler but anyways um
[10:59] if you guys appreciated this video
[11:00] please leave a like it definitely helps
[11:01] me out a ton like I said this workflow
[11:03] will be available for download within
[11:05] the free school Community which is
[11:06] linked down in the description check out
[11:08] the paid Community check out my website
[11:09] if you want me to help you build some of
[11:10] the stuff out or if you're looking for
[11:12] consultancy services but that's all I've
[11:13] got for this one and um really
[11:15] appreciate you guys making it to the end
[11:16] of this video so thanks everyone
