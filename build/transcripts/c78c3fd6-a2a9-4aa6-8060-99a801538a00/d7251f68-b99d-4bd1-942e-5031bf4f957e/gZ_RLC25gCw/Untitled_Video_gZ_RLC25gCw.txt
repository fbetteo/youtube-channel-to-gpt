[00:00] So, Apify is like a marketplace for
[00:01] actors, which essentially let us scrape
[00:03] anything on the internet. As you can see
[00:04] right here, we're able to explore 4,500
[00:07] plus pre-built actors for web scraping
[00:09] and automation. And it's really not that
[00:10] complicated. An actor is basically just
[00:11] a predefined script that was already
[00:13] built for us that we can just send off a
[00:15] certain request to. So, you can think of
[00:16] it like a virtual assistant where you're
[00:17] saying, "Hey, I want you to I want to
[00:19] use the Tik Tok virtual assistant and I
[00:21] want you to scrape, you know, videos
[00:22] that have the hashtag of AI content." Or
[00:25] you could use the LinkedIn job scraper
[00:26] and you could say, I want to find jobs
[00:28] that are titled business analyst. So
[00:30] there's just so many ways you could use
[00:31] Appify. You could get leads from Google
[00:32] Maps. You could get Instagram comments.
[00:34] You could get Facebook posts. There's
[00:36] just almost unlimited things you can do
[00:37] here. You can even tap into Apollo's
[00:39] database of leads and just get a ton. So
[00:41] today, I'm just going to show you guys
[00:42] in Naden the easiest way to set up this
[00:44] Apify actor where you're going to start
[00:46] the actor and then you're going to just
[00:47] grab those results. So, what you're
[00:49] going to want to do is head over to
[00:50] Apify using the link in the description
[00:51] and then use code 30 Nate Herk to get
[00:54] 30% off. Okay, like I said, what we're
[00:56] going to be covering today is a two-step
[00:57] process where you make one request to
[00:59] Ampify to start up an actor and then
[01:01] you're going to wait for it to finish up
[01:03] and then you're just going to pull those
[01:04] results back in. So, let me show you
[01:05] what that looks like. What I'm going to
[01:06] do is hit test workflow and this is
[01:08] going to start the Google Maps actor.
[01:09] And what we're doing here is we're
[01:10] asking for dentists in New York. And
[01:12] then if I go to my Appify console and I
[01:13] go over here to actors and click on the
[01:15] Google Maps extractor one. If I click on
[01:17] runs, we can see that there's one
[01:19] currently finishing up right now. And
[01:20] now that it's finished, I can go back
[01:22] into our workflow. I can hook it up to
[01:23] the get results node. Hit test step. And
[01:26] this is going to pull in those 50
[01:28] dentists that we just scraped in New
[01:30] York. And you can see this contains
[01:31] information like their address, their
[01:33] website, their phone number, all this
[01:34] kind of stuff. So you can just basically
[01:36] scrape these lists of leads. So anyways,
[01:38] that's how this works. But let's walk
[01:40] through a live setup. So once you're in
[01:41] your Appify console, you click on the
[01:43] Appify store and this is where you can
[01:44] see all the different actors. And let's
[01:46] do an example of like a social media
[01:48] one. So I'm going to click on this Tik
[01:49] Tok scraper since it's just the first
[01:51] one right here. And this may seem a
[01:52] little bit confusing, but it's not going
[01:54] to be too bad at all. We get to
[01:55] basically do all this with natural
[01:56] language. So let me show you guys how
[01:58] this works. So basically, we have this
[02:00] configuration panel right here. When you
[02:01] open up any sort of actor, they won't
[02:03] always all be the same, but in this one,
[02:05] what we have is videos with this
[02:06] hashtag. So we can put something in. I
[02:08] put in AI content to play around with
[02:09] earlier. And then you can see it asks
[02:11] how many videos do you want back. So in
[02:13] this case I put 10. Let's just put 25
[02:15] for the sake of this demo. And then you
[02:16] have the option to add more settings. So
[02:17] down here we could do, you know, we
[02:19] could add certain profiles that we want
[02:20] to scrape. We could add a different
[02:21] search functionality. We could even have
[02:23] it download the videos for us. So once
[02:25] you're good with this configuration and
[02:27] just don't over complicate it, think of
[02:28] it the same way you would like put in
[02:30] filters on an e-commerce website or the
[02:32] same way you would, you know, fill in
[02:33] your order when you're door dashing some
[02:35] food. So, now that we have this filled
[02:37] out the way we want it, all I'm going to
[02:38] do is come up to the top right and hit
[02:39] API and click API endpoints. The first
[02:42] thing we're going to do is we're going
[02:43] to use this endpoint called run actor.
[02:45] This is the one that's basically just
[02:47] going to send a request to Amplify and
[02:48] start this process, but it's not going
[02:50] to give us the live results back. That's
[02:51] why the second step later is to pull the
[02:53] results back. What you could do is you
[02:55] could run the actor synchronously,
[02:56] meaning it's going to send it off and
[02:58] it's just going to spin in and it end
[02:59] until we're done and until it has the
[03:01] results. But I found this way to be more
[03:03] consistent. So anyways, all you have to
[03:05] do is click on copy and it's already
[03:06] going to have copied over your Ampify
[03:09] API key. So it's really, really simple.
[03:11] All we're going to do here is open up a
[03:12] new HTTP request. I'm going to just
[03:14] paste in that URL that we just copied
[03:17] right here. And that's basically all we
[03:18] have to do except for we want to change
[03:20] this method to post because as you can
[03:22] see right here, it says post. And so
[03:24] this is basically just us putting in the
[03:25] actor's phone number. And so we're
[03:27] giving it a call. But now what we have
[03:28] to do is actually tell it what we want.
[03:30] So right here, we've already filled this
[03:32] out. I'm going to click on JSON and all
[03:34] I have to do is just copy this JSON
[03:35] right here. Go back into NN. Flick this
[03:38] on to send a body and we want to send
[03:40] over just JSON. And then all I have to
[03:42] do is paste that in there. So, as you
[03:43] can see, what we're sending over to this
[03:44] Tik Tok scraper is I want AI content and
[03:47] I want 25 results. And then all this
[03:49] other stuff is false. So, I'm just going
[03:50] to hit test. And so, this basically
[03:51] returns us with an ID and says, okay,
[03:53] the actor has started. If we go back
[03:55] into here and we click on runs, we can
[03:57] see that this crawler is now running.
[03:59] and it's going to basically tell us how
[04:00] much it costed, how long it took, and
[04:02] all this kind of stuff. And now it's
[04:04] already done. So, what we need to do now
[04:05] is we need to click on API up in the top
[04:07] right, click on API endpoints again, and
[04:09] scroll all the way down to the bottom
[04:11] where we can see get last run data set
[04:14] items. So, all I need to do is hit this
[04:15] copy button right here. Go back into
[04:17] Nitn and then open up another HTTP
[04:19] request. And then I'm just going to
[04:21] paste that URL right in there once
[04:23] again. And I don't even have to change
[04:24] the method because if we go in here, we
[04:26] can see that this is a get. So, all I
[04:28] have to do is hit test step. And this is
[04:30] going to pull in those 25 results from
[04:33] our Tik Tok scrape based on the search
[04:34] term AI content. So, you can see right
[04:36] here it says 25 items. And just to show
[04:38] you guys that it really is 25 items, I'm
[04:40] just going to grab a set field. And
[04:41] we're going to just drag in the actual
[04:43] text from here and hit test step. And it
[04:46] should Oh, we have to connect the
[04:47] trigger. So, I'm just going to move this
[04:49] trigger over here real quick. And um
[04:51] what you can do is because we already
[04:52] have our data here, I can just pin it so
[04:54] we don't actually have to run it again.
[04:56] But then I'll hit test step. And now we
[04:57] can see we're going to get our 25 items
[04:59] right here, which are all of the text
[05:02] content. So I think just the captions or
[05:04] the titles of these Tik Toks. And we
[05:05] have all 25 Tik Toks as you can see. So
[05:08] I just showed you guys the two-step
[05:09] method and why I've been using it
[05:11] because here's an example where I did
[05:12] the synchronous run. So all I did was I
[05:14] came to the Google maps and I went to
[05:16] API endpoints and then I wanted to do
[05:19] run actor synchronously which basically
[05:21] means that it would run it in n and it
[05:23] would spin until the results were done
[05:24] and then it should feed back the output.
[05:26] So I copied that I put it into here and
[05:28] as you can see I just ran it with the
[05:30] Google maps looking for plumbers and we
[05:31] got nothing back. So that's why we're
[05:33] taking this two-step approach where as
[05:34] you can see here we're going to do that
[05:36] exact same request. We're doing a
[05:38] request for plumbers and we're going to
[05:39] fire this off. And so nothing came back
[05:41] in edit end. But if we go to our actor
[05:43] and we go to runs, we can see right here
[05:45] that this was the one that we just made
[05:46] for plumbers. And if we click into it,
[05:48] we can see all the plumbers. So that's
[05:50] why we're taking the two-step approach.
[05:51] I'm going to make the exact same request
[05:52] here for New York plumbers. And what I'm
[05:54] going to do is just run this workflow.
[05:56] And now I wanted to talk about what we
[05:58] have to do because what happens is we
[06:00] started the actor and as you can see
[06:01] it's running right now. And then it went
[06:03] to grab the results but the results
[06:04] aren't done yet. So that's why it comes
[06:05] back and says this is an item but it's
[06:08] empty. So, what we want to do is we want
[06:09] to go to our runs and we want to see how
[06:11] long this is taking on average for 50
[06:13] leads. As you can see, the most amount
[06:15] of time it's ever taken was 19 seconds.
[06:17] So, I'm just going to go in here and in
[06:18] between the start actor and grab
[06:20] results, I'm going to add a wait. And
[06:22] I'm just going to tell this thing to
[06:23] wait for 22 seconds just to be safe. And
[06:25] now, what I'm going to do is just run
[06:26] this thing again. It's going to start
[06:28] the actor. It's going to wait for 22
[06:29] seconds. So, if we go back into Amplify,
[06:31] you can see that the actor is once again
[06:33] running. After about 22 seconds, it's
[06:36] going to pass over and then we should
[06:37] get all 50 results back in our HTTP
[06:40] request. There we go. Just finished up.
[06:41] And now you can see that we have 50
[06:43] items, which are all of the plumbers
[06:45] that we got in New York. So from here,
[06:47] now that you have these 50 leads, and
[06:48] remember, if you want to come back into
[06:50] Appify and change up your input, you can
[06:53] change how many places you want to
[06:54] extract. So if you change this to 200
[06:56] and then you clicked on JSON and you
[06:57] copied in that body, you would now be
[06:59] searching for 200 results. But anyways,
[07:02] that's the hard part is getting the
[07:03] leads into end. But now we have all this
[07:05] data about them and we can just, you
[07:06] know, do some research, send them off a
[07:08] email, whatever it is, we can just
[07:10] basically have this thing running 24/7.
[07:12] And if you wanted to make this workflow
[07:13] more advanced to handle a little bit
[07:15] more dynamic amount of results. What
[07:17] you'd want to use is a technique called
[07:19] polling. So basically, you'd wait, you
[07:21] check in, and then if the results were
[07:23] all done, you continue down the process.
[07:25] But if they weren't all done, you would
[07:26] basically wait again and come back. And
[07:28] you would just loop through this until
[07:30] you're confident that all of the results
[07:32] are done. So that's going to be it for
[07:33] this one. I will have this template
[07:34] available in my free school community if
[07:36] you want to play around with it. Just
[07:37] remember you'll have to come in here and
[07:39] you'll have to switch out your own API
[07:40] key. And don't forget when you get to
[07:41] Ampify, you can use code 30 Nate Herk to
[07:43] get 30% off. Anyways, that's going to do
[07:45] it for this one. If you appreciated the
[07:46] video, if you learned something new,
[07:47] definitely give it a like. It helps me
[07:48] out a ton. And as always, I appreciate
[07:50] you guys making it to the end of this
[07:51] video. I'll see you in the next one.
[07:53] Thanks everyone.
