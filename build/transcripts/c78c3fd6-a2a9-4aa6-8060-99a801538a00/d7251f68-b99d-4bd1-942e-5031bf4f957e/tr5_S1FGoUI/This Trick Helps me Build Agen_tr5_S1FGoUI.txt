[00:00] today I'm going to be talking about the
[00:01] technique that I use to build the
[00:02] ultimate assistant workflow in under an
[00:04] hour now that won't include final
[00:05] testing and refining and airor handling
[00:08] but the point of this video is that if
[00:09] you don't know this method or if you
[00:10] kind of know about it but don't really
[00:12] understand it and you start to use it
[00:13] after this video it's going to help you
[00:15] build agents three times faster and if
[00:16] you haven't watched my video about the
[00:17] ultimate assistant yet go to my free
[00:19] school Community the link for that's
[00:20] down in the description you can grab the
[00:22] templates for free right here you can
[00:23] watch the video and then you can
[00:24] download all of the workflows right here
[00:26] that you need to plug it into your own
[00:27] nadn and if you're interested in a more
[00:29] Hands-On approach to learning nadn and
[00:31] you want to see me build out the
[00:32] ultimate assistance step by step and
[00:33] check out the paid Community the link
[00:34] for that's also down in the description
[00:36] we' got a great community of members who
[00:37] are always sharing resources they're all
[00:39] dedicated to learning about nadn and AI
[00:41] agents we've got a classroom section
[00:42] with different Deep dive topics like
[00:44] building agents Vector databases apis
[00:46] and HTTP requests and then here's the
[00:48] series I'm launching up where I'm doing
[00:49] step-by-step builds of all of my YouTube
[00:51] videos and of course we've got five live
[00:53] calls per week sort of group sessions
[00:54] where we go over tech support issues um
[00:56] make sure you're not getting stuck get
[00:57] questions answered and just network with
[00:59] other IND indviduals in the space but
[01:01] anyways let's get back to the video so
[01:02] what is the method that we're going to
[01:03] be talking about today well when you're
[01:05] creating an AI agent and you want to
[01:06] give it access to tools you'll click on
[01:08] this plus and on the right you'll have a
[01:09] bunch of tools right here and what we're
[01:10] looking at are these Integrations where
[01:13] we have nodes as tools so in this case
[01:15] we would have clicked on Gmail tool and
[01:16] then we have these pop up and then
[01:18] within there we have to configure
[01:19] certain things so in this send email
[01:21] tool for example we have to configure
[01:23] who's the email going to what's the
[01:24] subject of the email and then what is
[01:26] the message of the email in order for
[01:27] the agent to actually be able to send it
[01:29] and so what we do do is we fill out
[01:30] these parameters with a from AI function
[01:32] it may look a little intimidating but
[01:33] trust me it's not so this video is all
[01:35] about breaking this down so you
[01:36] understand what's going on in a nutshell
[01:38] the AI is going to take your original
[01:40] query when you're talking to it and then
[01:41] it's going to be able to use its brain
[01:42] to fill out everything it needs to
[01:43] within this node configuration so let's
[01:45] hop over to a quick visualization that I
[01:47] made and then we're going to look at
[01:48] some examples in nadn and I'll show you
[01:50] guys how quickly we can spin something
[01:51] up okay so here we are in excal draw and
[01:53] I have a visualization that I made which
[01:55] is going to explain this process
[01:56] hopefully really simply break it all
[01:58] down what we have here is an AI agent
[02:00] and its only tool is to send an email so
[02:01] we're sticking on that theme right now
[02:03] and we have a trigger which is US
[02:04] chatting to the agent we would send over
[02:06] something like send an email to Nate
[02:08] herk asking how his day was the agent
[02:10] would then understand okay I need to
[02:11] send an email I'm going to use my tool
[02:13] called send email but within my tool I
[02:15] have to configure the two the subject
[02:16] the email the CC's potentially maybe
[02:19] there's attachments anyways it has to
[02:20] figure out all this information in order
[02:22] to actually send that email off so what
[02:23] we're breaking down is what actually
[02:25] goes on in this black box here of the
[02:27] send email tool well let's come over
[02:29] here and look at this process so here's
[02:31] the original query right here send an
[02:33] email to Nate asking how his day was the
[02:35] AI is able to interpret based on the
[02:37] function that we set up within the node
[02:39] who's the emo going to what's the
[02:40] subject what's the body and then it uses
[02:42] the original query to actually you know
[02:44] fill in those parameters which in this
[02:46] case nerk example.com it makes the
[02:49] subject checking in and then it actually
[02:50] makes an email body for us right here so
[02:53] once it does this based on the original
[02:54] query it can feed it back into the tool
[02:57] put it in into the right parameters in
[02:58] the node and then then it can go back
[03:00] and actually send the message and tell
[03:01] the agent that we're done and then the
[03:03] agent can let us know as the human okay
[03:05] I went ahead and I sent that email off
[03:07] so here we are in end end I'm going to
[03:08] connect a few different tools and step
[03:10] byep show you guys how to use this
[03:11] function and you're going to see that
[03:12] we're going to be able to spin up an
[03:13] agent in 5 minutes that can do some
[03:15] pretty cool stuff already so let's first
[03:17] just click on the plus under tool we're
[03:18] going to be adding a tool to this agent
[03:21] um and I just named it from AI it it
[03:23] doesn't mean anything special there you
[03:24] don't have to do anything um but what
[03:26] we're going to do is we're going to add
[03:27] a Outlook tool because you guys have
[03:29] been begging for some Outlook
[03:30] Integrations and what we're going to do
[03:32] here is just stick on the theme real
[03:33] quick and send an email so as you can
[03:35] see we have the two the subject and the
[03:37] message what we're going to do is make
[03:39] sure that we're changing the two field
[03:40] to an expression and all we have to do
[03:42] is type in two curly braces a dollar
[03:44] sign an f and then we'll see the from AI
[03:47] function pops up so before we click into
[03:49] this we can see that we configure it
[03:51] sort of similar to the way we would
[03:53] configure like an Excel formula where we
[03:55] have different parameters to fill out
[03:57] the first one is a key this is
[03:58] describing to the AI model what are you
[04:00] looking for in this parameter the key is
[04:02] the only field that's required as you
[04:04] can see there's no question mark after
[04:05] it but the other three ones description
[04:07] type and default value have question
[04:08] marks so a lot of the times we're able
[04:10] to just only fill out a key but you can
[04:12] add a description to make it a little
[04:13] more robust and all that is is just
[04:14] describing what the key is so we could
[04:16] say the key would be an email address
[04:17] and then the description could be the
[04:19] email address of the person the user
[04:20] wants to send an email to but we don't
[04:22] need to do that then we also have the
[04:24] data type so in this case we know the
[04:26] email address we're looking for a string
[04:27] or a word but in a different case where
[04:29] Maybe we're looking at you know order
[04:31] history and we want to say like the
[04:32] order number we could tell the AI okay
[04:34] you're looking for a number data type in
[04:36] this case just to make its job a little
[04:38] easier and then finally we have default
[04:39] value so if the AI is unable to find the
[04:41] key that you've described to it it will
[04:43] just default to this value every time so
[04:45] in this case all we have to do is um put
[04:47] in two quotation marks and then within
[04:49] the quotation marks I'm putting email
[04:51] address and so this is telling the AI to
[04:53] look for an email address you have to
[04:55] make sure it's an expression if it's
[04:56] fixed it's going to look white like this
[04:58] but if it's an expression it's going to
[04:59] be gray or red or green and that's how
[05:02] you know that it's variably going to be
[05:03] passing over um you know using the AI to
[05:05] fill in this key rather than just
[05:07] sending out this actual text right here
[05:10] okay so I copi and pasted that same
[05:12] expression into subject and message made
[05:13] them all expressions and now I'm just
[05:15] going to swap out the key so for the key
[05:17] in the subject field I'm just going to
[05:18] type in subject and then for the key in
[05:20] the email address field or sorry the
[05:22] message field I'm just going to type in
[05:23] email body so now the AI is going to be
[05:26] able to see the query that we originally
[05:27] sent to it and then pick out the the two
[05:30] the subject and the message based on
[05:31] these keys that we set up and just to
[05:33] stay organized I named this tool send
[05:35] email because once again I wanted to
[05:36] show you guys we have no prompting in
[05:38] here all it says is you're a helpful
[05:39] assistant so we didn't tell anything
[05:41] about the functions that's all happening
[05:42] within the tool and we didn't tell it
[05:44] that it has this tool but it's going to
[05:45] be able to intelligently understand that
[05:47] okay we're going to test out this tool
[05:49] I'm saying send an email to Nate letting
[05:50] him know that I'm going to be late to
[05:51] the meeting but go ahead and start
[05:53] without me please mention to not bring
[05:55] up the budget cuts until I get there
[05:56] though so as you can see it was able to
[05:58] hit the tool it already sent out that
[05:59] email really quick the agent let us know
[06:01] that it sent the email off and what we
[06:03] can do is Click into this tool and we
[06:04] can see how it reasoned through what to
[06:06] do so if you remember we set three keys
[06:09] email address subject and email body and
[06:11] on the left you can see that it
[06:12] populated them over here with actual
[06:14] text that goes within each of those keys
[06:17] so it gave us a subject of delay in
[06:18] joining meeting the body is hey Nate I
[06:20] wanted to let you know that I'm going to
[06:21] be late to the meeting please go ahead
[06:23] and start without me however could you
[06:24] please refrain from bringing up the
[06:25] budget cuts until I get there so let's
[06:27] go into Outlook real quick and make sure
[06:28] it actually sent this off all right here
[06:30] it is hi Nate wanted to let you know
[06:31] that I'm going to be late to the meeting
[06:32] blah blah blah as you can see it didn't
[06:33] know how to sign off as us and that's
[06:35] just because of the prompting but the
[06:37] point of this is that it was able to
[06:38] really quickly intelligently make a
[06:40] subject and an email based on our pretty
[06:42] short query and so all we'd have to do
[06:43] is come into the agent come into the
[06:45] system prompts real quick and then just
[06:46] say sign off emails as
[06:50] Bob we can go ahead and save this and we
[06:53] will just send that same query back over
[06:55] it will do the exact same thing and you
[06:56] can see it's going to change the actual
[06:58] message a little bit compared to the
[06:59] first one
[07:00] but this time it's going to sign off as
[07:01] Bob so if we come into here we will see
[07:03] that we have running late to meeting so
[07:04] it's a different subject email body is
[07:06] similar but not the exact same and this
[07:08] time it signs off as Bob then here we
[07:10] are in the sent emails and Outlook we
[07:11] can see it sent to Nate herk 88 we have
[07:13] the subject we have the body and then we
[07:15] have a sign off as Bob cool so we
[07:17] already have basically a functioning
[07:18] email agent and we spun that up in maybe
[07:21] 5 minutes probably less now let's do a
[07:23] different tool so let's look at using
[07:24] Outlook again but this time we're going
[07:26] to be um creating a calendar event so
[07:28] I'm going to do event I'm going to do
[07:30] create and now we can see after we
[07:32] choose our calendar real quick now you
[07:33] can see we have three Fields once again
[07:35] that we need to set up the functions so
[07:36] the AI can figure out how to populate
[07:38] these parameters so first in the title
[07:40] make sure it's an expression grabbing
[07:41] two curly braces dollar sign from Ai and
[07:44] then in the key I'm just going to put
[07:46] event title simple as that and we could
[07:50] add a description to the event title we
[07:51] don't really need to as you can see in
[07:53] the previous example we didn't have to
[07:54] add descriptions and it still worked but
[07:55] we're going to do the same thing now
[07:56] with these final two Fields start time
[07:58] and end time we are going to copy in
[08:00] this expression into both of them and
[08:03] then just change out the actual key so
[08:04] for start time I'm just going to say
[08:06] start time and then for this end
[08:08] function once again I'm just going to
[08:10] say end time and then I just named the
[08:12] node create event and now we have this
[08:14] tool which we can go ahead and test out
[08:16] one thing I am going to do though is in
[08:18] the system prompts I'm going to give the
[08:20] agent access to the current date and
[08:21] time so here is the current date and
[08:25] time and we do this by doing two curly
[08:27] braces and we're calling a different
[08:28] function this time we're doing dollar
[08:30] sign now which as you can see on the
[08:31] right it just gives the agent access to
[08:33] the current date and time that way we're
[08:36] able to say create an event for 1 p.m.
[08:37] today and the agent will know what today
[08:39] is um and then we said it's going to be
[08:41] an hour long and I'm meeting my friend
[08:42] Andy for lunch at Chipotle so it's going
[08:44] to be able to know to use the create
[08:46] event tool it's going to fill out the
[08:48] parameters in there it says I've
[08:49] scheduled your lunch with Andy at
[08:51] Chipotle for today at 1 p.m. and let's
[08:53] click into the node and see what it did
[08:55] now remember our three keys were event
[08:56] title start time and end time and you
[08:58] can see that it populated all these
[08:59] parameters correct so let's hop into
[09:01] Outlook real quick and see the results
[09:03] all right there's my outlook for today
[09:04] we can see that at 1:00 p.m. we have
[09:06] lunch with Andy at Chipotle and it made
[09:08] it that it's from 1 to two so it
[09:09] listened to us when we said it's going
[09:11] to be an hour long okay so those were
[09:13] just two examples with Outlook if you
[09:14] come into here everything else is going
[09:16] to be pretty much the same so let's say
[09:17] we want to do something in slack we
[09:19] would basically just send the message to
[09:21] um you know we could choose our Channel
[09:22] but when it actually comes to the
[09:23] message all I have to do is come in here
[09:25] um choose the dollar sign from AI
[09:27] function and then just to find the key
[09:29] so all of these nodes as tools are going
[09:30] to have different parameters to send
[09:31] across and all you have to do is
[09:33] basically tell the AI when you're you
[09:35] know filling out this section this is
[09:36] what you're looking for okay but now
[09:37] let's say we're doing something that's
[09:39] maybe an HTTP request rather than you
[09:41] know one of these wrapped up natively
[09:42] integrated Tools in nadn so what we're
[09:44] going to try here is connected to an API
[09:46] called tavali which lets you search the
[09:48] internet and if we click on tool we can
[09:50] see that you know these native nodes as
[09:51] tools we don't have a Tav one so
[09:53] anything that there's not a na native
[09:55] integration in n n we can still connect
[09:57] to using an HTTP request assuming they
[09:59] have a publicly exposed API but we want
[10:02] to do it a little differently but it's
[10:03] the exact same you know principles so
[10:06] we're going to go ahead and connect up
[10:07] to this tavali tool which is just an
[10:09] HTTP request node as a tool and so all
[10:11] the stuff is going to be the same the
[10:12] URL the headers all that kind of stuff
[10:15] but what's going to change every time is
[10:16] the actual Json body that we're sending
[10:18] over because we want to search the
[10:19] internet for something different as you
[10:20] can see right here search term that's
[10:22] going to differ every time based on what
[10:24] we say to the agent so this is going to
[10:25] be a little different than the from AI
[10:27] but it's the exact same concept where
[10:28] we're setting a key and then the agent's
[10:30] going to be looking for that to fill in
[10:32] so in this case our key is search term
[10:34] as you can see right here and then down
[10:35] here you can see it says use a
[10:36] placeholder for any data to be filled in
[10:38] by the model so our key is search term
[10:40] and then we're describing that key as
[10:42] what the user is searching the internet
[10:44] for so I just sent off this query that
[10:45] says search the internet for burger
[10:47] joints as you can see hitting the
[10:48] internet tool and then the search term
[10:50] is going to be picked out by the model
[10:52] and it's probably going to say um you
[10:54] know best burger joints or something
[10:55] like that so once we get a response from
[10:57] the agent which right now is processing
[10:59] what it got back from tavali there we go
[11:02] um excellent burger joints in Charlotte
[11:04] North Carolina I'm not in Charlotte that
[11:05] just has to do with the prompting I
[11:07] assume but it listed 10 burger joints as
[11:09] you can see right here or nine and then
[11:10] it gave us also yelp's website we could
[11:12] click into it if we don't believe tavali
[11:14] for some reason but anyways let's click
[11:16] into the Tav tool to see what happened
[11:18] on left hand side we can see that our
[11:19] key of search term got populated with
[11:21] burger joints near me so that's the
[11:23] exact same thing as you know the from AI
[11:25] because the agent basically is using its
[11:28] brain to figure out what is the search
[11:29] term that we're sending off to tab all
[11:31] right so now that we understand how the
[11:32] from a function works and how quickly
[11:34] and easy it is to set up some of these
[11:35] different tools now it's just a matter
[11:37] of plugging them in testing them and
[11:38] adding more so we started off with
[11:40] something like a send email we test it
[11:42] out once we know it works we can start
[11:43] to add more and more and as you can see
[11:45] I was able to add all of these and then
[11:46] you obviously want to give it sort of a
[11:48] system prompt where you're in here and
[11:50] you're telling it what each tool does as
[11:51] you can see this prompt still isn't too
[11:54] long or complex at all but then from
[11:56] there it's just about manipulating the
[11:57] logic so that you can get what you need
[11:59] within each parameter so a great example
[12:01] here is with the email reply tool when
[12:03] we want to reply to an email the AI is
[12:04] going to be looking for an ID so this is
[12:06] going to be the ID thread of your Gmail
[12:09] thread so that the agent can actually
[12:10] reply rather than creating a new email
[12:12] so we told it to look for an ID and we
[12:14] described it as the message ID and how
[12:17] does it actually get that because when
[12:18] we ask it to reply to something we're
[12:20] not going to be able to provide it the
[12:21] message ID so what we have to do is
[12:23] first get emails when we're getting all
[12:25] the emails it can be either from a
[12:26] specific sender or you know the last 10
[12:28] or whatever then it's going to come back
[12:30] as an output and each email is going to
[12:32] have a thread ID what we did is in the
[12:34] system prompt we told the agent you know
[12:36] when you want to use email reply you
[12:39] must first get emails so that you have
[12:41] the message ID of the email to reply to
[12:43] and then once the agent has that it can
[12:45] send it off to this tool so that we can
[12:47] actually reply to emails so that's going
[12:48] to be it for this one just wanted to
[12:49] come in here and talk about the from a
[12:51] function really quick because it's so so
[12:53] powerful and if you're not using it you
[12:54] definitely need to be because like I
[12:55] said it's going to help you build agents
[12:57] three times faster so as always really
[12:59] appreciate you guys making it to the end
[13:00] of this one if you appreciated it if you
[13:02] learned something new please give it a
