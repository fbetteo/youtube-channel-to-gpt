[00:00] This is how you use Firecol to search,
[00:02] scrape, and take screenshots of the web
[00:04] all in one request. Okay, so I'm going
[00:06] to ask this agent to help me find three
[00:07] articles on reddit.com where the
[00:09] following words are all in the title,
[00:11] which should be AI, automation, and
[00:13] help. So, it's using its tool right now,
[00:14] Firecrawl Search, to make that request.
[00:16] It's saying, okay, we're looking at
[00:18] Reddit. We want to make sure it has
[00:19] these words in the title, and it's going
[00:21] to get markdown format of the results as
[00:23] well as screenshots. Okay, so we just
[00:25] got those results. It said, here are
[00:27] three articles from Reddit, and here are
[00:28] the words that are in the titles. We
[00:29] have help with automation AI and then we
[00:32] have the link right here to the actual
[00:33] source. So let's open that up. You can
[00:35] see it links to an actual Reddit post in
[00:37] the NN Reddit. And what we can do is we
[00:39] can look at the screenshot to make sure
[00:40] it matches what we got in the actual
[00:42] URL. And there it is. We can zoom in.
[00:44] This is the full Reddit thread that we
[00:46] can go ahead and read through in
[00:47] screenshot format. If you want to watch
[00:48] the full video, click on the play button
