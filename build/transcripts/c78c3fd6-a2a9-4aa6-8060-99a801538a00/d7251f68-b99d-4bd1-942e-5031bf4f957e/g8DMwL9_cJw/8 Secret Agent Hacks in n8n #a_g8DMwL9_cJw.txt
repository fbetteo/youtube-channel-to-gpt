[00:00] These are eight hidden AI agent settings
[00:01] that no one's talking about. Okay, so
[00:03] let's just get right into it. We're
[00:05] looking at these eight different
[00:06] settings that you can actually find
[00:07] within the chat models or the brains for
[00:09] your AI agents. So right here, if I
[00:11] click into open router and I click on
[00:12] add option, you can see that we have
[00:14] these eight options right here, which
[00:15] are frequency penalty, maximum number of
[00:18] tokens, response format, presence
[00:20] penalty, sampling temperature, timeout,
[00:23] max retries, and top P. So we're going
[00:25] to break these down. The first one is
[00:27] frequency penalty. And what this does is
[00:29] it discourages the model from repeating
[00:30] the same words or phrases. If I click
[00:32] into this and we add frequency penalty,
[00:34] you can see that by default it's at
[00:36] zero, which means that repetition is
[00:37] likely. And the highest you can go up to
[00:39] is two. So if I put three, it would just
[00:41] go to two. But when you're at higher
[00:43] closer to two, it makes the repetition
[00:45] less likely, while negative values
[00:47] encourage repetition. Okay, so the next
[00:49] one we're looking at is maximum number
[00:50] of tokens. And what this does is it sets
[00:52] the maximum length for the model's
[00:54] response. So that way you can kind of
[00:55] control if you don't want them to write
[00:57] a whole novel for you every time and
[00:58] blow through your tokens and your
[00:59] credits, then you can set what's the
[01:01] maximum that they can actually output.
[01:03] All right, next up we have response
[01:04] format, which is basically how do we
[01:06] want the AI model to respond. There's
[01:08] only really two options here, which are
[01:09] either text or JSON. And pretty much
[01:11] always I think you're going to leave
[01:12] this on text. All right, the next one is
[01:14] presence penalty. So this basically
[01:17] penalizes the model for using a word
[01:19] that it's already used. So, kind of
[01:21] similar to the frequency penalty of like
[01:22] repeating things, but a little bit
[01:24] different. All right, so the next one is
[01:25] sampling temperature. This controls the
[01:27] randomness in the output. So, this is
[01:29] probably the one that you may have heard
[01:30] of before, which is kind of just known
[01:32] as temperature. It ranges from 0 to 1.
[01:35] So, if you want responses to be more
[01:36] predictable, you're going to go more
[01:37] towards zero. And if you want them to be
[01:39] a little bit more random and creative,
[01:40] you're going to go towards one. And by
[01:42] default, it is set at 0.7. If you want
[01:45] to watch the full breakdown, click on
