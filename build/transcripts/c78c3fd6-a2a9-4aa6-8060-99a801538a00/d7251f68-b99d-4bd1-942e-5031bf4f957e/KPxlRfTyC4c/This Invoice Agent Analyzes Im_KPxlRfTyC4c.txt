[00:00] I just built this invoice AI agent in
[00:01] nadn using no code we got telegram open
[00:04] I'm just going to drag over an invoice
[00:05] here drop it in to telegram hit send and
[00:07] now we will see telegram is going to
[00:09] download that file we're hitting an OCR
[00:11] API which is going to take the image
[00:13] extract the text it's going to parse it
[00:15] out it updates our database with our
[00:16] invoices and now we're redownloading
[00:18] that file so we can put it into a Google
[00:20] Drive so we can access that original
[00:21] file if we want and now we're hitting
[00:22] the agent which we just saw we got a
[00:24] response thanks for submitting the
[00:26] invoice the total amount is 950 due date
[00:28] is December 15th we will see that this
[00:30] invoice got populated into our database
[00:33] here and then if we go to our Google
[00:34] Drive we can see that we got the actual
[00:36] invoice put in here the original file so
[00:38] in case we need to look at it good to go
[00:40] if you want to find out how you can
[00:41] build this for yourself go to my channel
[00:42] and watch the video and while you're
[00:43] there check out some other AI agent
[00:45] tutorials I'll see you there
