[00:00] All right, so AI agents, artificial
[00:01] intelligence, whatever it is, there is
[00:03] definitely a lot of hype. There's no
[00:04] denying that. And so the purpose of this
[00:06] section is just to make sure we can cut
[00:08] through all of that and actually
[00:09] understand what is an AI agent at its
[00:11] core. What can they do and why do we
[00:14] need them? You probably heard, you know,
[00:15] digital employee or virtual assistant,
[00:17] all this kind of stuff. But we need to
[00:19] understand what that actually means and
[00:21] what powers them. So at this point, I'm
[00:23] sure we are all familiar with something
[00:24] like chatebt, which is a large language
[00:27] model at its core. And so we're looking
[00:28] at right here is a very simple
[00:30] visualization of how a large language
[00:31] model works. Meaning right here in green
[00:33] we have a large language model. Let's
[00:35] say it's chatgbt and we the user give it
[00:38] some sort of input. So maybe that's like
[00:39] hey help me write an email to John. The
[00:41] LLM would then take our input process
[00:44] this. It would basically just create an
[00:46] email for us and then it would spit that
[00:47] out as an output and that's it. This LLM
[00:50] at its core cannot take any action. It's
[00:52] really not that practical. It just kind
[00:54] of helps you be more productive because
[00:55] at the end of the process, we'd have to
[00:57] take this output and copy and paste it
[00:59] into something that actually can take
[01:00] action like Gmail. And so the power of
[01:02] these large language models really comes
[01:04] into play when we start to expose them
[01:06] to different tools. And tools just means
[01:08] any of these integrations that we use
[01:09] every single day within our work that
[01:11] let us actually do something. So whether
[01:13] that's send an email or update a row in
[01:15] our CRM or look at a database or Air
[01:18] Table, whatever it is, even Outlook,
[01:21] that's a tool. It just means connecting
[01:23] to an actual platform that we use to do
[01:25] something. So now instead of having the
[01:27] LLM help us write an email that we would
[01:28] copy and paste or us exporting a Google
[01:31] sheet and giving it to an LLM to
[01:32] analyze, it can basically just interact
[01:34] with any of its tools that we give it
[01:36] access to. So when we add an LLM to
[01:39] tools, we basically can get two
[01:41] different things and that is either an
[01:43] AI workflow or an AI agent. So right
[01:45] away you can already tell what the
[01:47] difference is, but you can also see some
[01:48] similarities. So let's break it down.
[01:50] Starting with an AI workflow, we can see
[01:52] that we have an input similar to like we
[01:54] did up top with our LLM. But now,
[01:56] instead of just going input, LLM output,
[01:59] we can work in those tools right into
[02:01] the actual AI workflow itself. So, what
[02:04] this could actually look like
[02:04] practically is we have our first tool,
[02:06] which is also an input, which is a new
[02:08] row in our CRM pops up. Then, we're
[02:10] hitting another tool, which is
[02:11] Perplexity, where we're going to do
[02:13] research about the lead. And then, after
[02:15] that tool call, we're going to use an
[02:16] LLM. If you want to learn more like
