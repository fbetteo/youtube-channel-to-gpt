[00:00] I just built this workflow to automate
[00:01] faceless AI long form content okay so
[00:03] I'm going to go ahead and hit test
[00:04] workflow and we're going to see that
[00:06] we're hitting a Google sheet with our
[00:07] ideas and now we're hitting an intro and
[00:09] outro agent so this one's basically
[00:11] creating an introduction and an outro
[00:13] and then we're going to hit a ranker
[00:14] agent that's actually going to be taking
[00:16] the initial idea and it's going to be
[00:18] creating that top 10 ranking list as
[00:20] well as the image prompts for the video
[00:23] so what's really cool is we're going to
[00:24] be using an API right here called Json
[00:25] to video we're just hitting Json to
[00:27] video in order to turn our text into
[00:30] images and also render everything
[00:31] together with a voiceover and everything
[00:33] like that so I'll dive into what that
[00:35] looks like and this basically takes a
[00:36] few minutes to render so while we're
[00:38] waiting for that let's head over to the
