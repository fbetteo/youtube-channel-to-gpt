[00:00] This AI agent can research anything that
[00:02] you want. So before we hop into Niten
[00:03] and start building, I just wanted to
[00:05] real quick zoom out and tell you guys at
[00:06] a high level what we're doing today. So
[00:08] there are two services that we're going
[00:09] to have to access. Open router lets us
[00:11] connect to different AI models. So this
[00:13] is going to serve as the brain for our
[00:15] research agent. And then we're also
[00:16] going to connect to a tool called
[00:18] perplexity which is kind of like a
[00:19] chatgbt research tool on steroids. And
[00:22] now we're going to go and connect that
[00:23] first thing that I talked about which is
[00:24] open router in order to give our AI
[00:26] agent a brain. So right here, chat
[00:28] model. I'm going to click on the plus
[00:29] and at the bottom over here, I'm going
[00:31] to choose open router chat model. But
[00:33] now that we've connected to Open Router,
[00:34] I can choose from a ton of different
[00:36] chat models. As you can see, we have
[00:37] OpenAI's models, we have Perplexity
[00:38] models, we have Quen, we have Enthropic,
[00:40] we have Google. Now we need to add our
[00:42] research tool. So I'm going to click on
[00:44] this plus button right under tool and
[00:46] I'm just going to search for Perplexity.
[00:48] So I'm going to send off this very broad
[00:50] question where I said, "How can I
[00:52] optimize my sleep?" We're going to see
[00:53] that it's smart enough to use
[00:54] Perplexity. Right now, it's doing its
[00:56] deep research. I'll check back in with
[00:58] you guys when we get that report about
[00:59] how to optimize sleep. All right, so
[01:01] that just finished up. And keep in mind,
[01:03] if you're doing deep research, it's
[01:04] going to take a little longer than if
[01:05] you do more of a basic web search. But
[01:07] as you can see, we basically have this
[01:08] full report right here where it's
[01:10] telling us things like temperature or,
[01:12] you know, what you can do before bed in
[01:13] order to maintain a consistent sleep
[01:15] schedule, um, different relaxation
[01:17] routines, diet, exercise, all this kind
[01:20] of stuff. And if we click into the
[01:21] Perplexity tool, we can basically see
[01:23] all of the different sources that it
[01:24] used. So, you can see here it searched
[01:26] through 20 sources.
