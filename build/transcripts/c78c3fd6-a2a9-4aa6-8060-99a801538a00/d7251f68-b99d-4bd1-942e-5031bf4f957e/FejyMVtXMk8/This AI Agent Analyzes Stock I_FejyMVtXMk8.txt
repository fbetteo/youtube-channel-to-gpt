[00:00] I just created this financial analyst in
[00:01] nadn using no code okay we have our AI
[00:03] agent right here ready to go so we're
[00:05] going to send off this text that asks it
[00:06] to analyze Apple it's going to send that
[00:08] stock ticker to this tool that we
[00:10] created in nadn called get chart and
[00:12] then it sends that back to the agent to
[00:13] use anthropic 3.5 to actually make that
[00:16] analysis a little more in-depth we
[00:17] already got the chart back in our
[00:19] telegram right here and then the
[00:21] analysis is also going to be sent to us
[00:22] in telegram as you can see it's pretty
[00:24] in depth it basically breaks down
[00:26] Candlestick analysis downward Trend
[00:28] highlighted by recent con itive red
[00:30] candlesticks then it breaks down the
[00:31] macd talks about the signal line talks
[00:33] about the histogram then it goes into
[00:35] volume and finally support and
[00:37] resistance levels and then finally it
[00:38] goes into it's important to note that
[00:40] this analysis provides a snapshot of
[00:41] current market conditions but shouldn't
[00:43] be considered as Financial advice um
[00:45] this isn't really a financial adviser
[00:47] it's more of just giving a brief um
[00:48] financial analysis as well as a
[00:50] technical analysis on whatever stock you

[00:54] how you can build this or even just
