[00:00] I'm about to show you the quickest and
[00:01] easiest way that you're able to
[00:02] self-host your NAND. Install the MCP
[00:04] servers community node and then connect
[00:06] to any MCP server that you want. Now,
[00:08] there are a ton of different platforms
[00:09] that you can use to host NAND. The
[00:11] reason I'm using Alstio is because it's
[00:12] going to be really simple for deploying
[00:14] and managing open- source software. I'm
[00:16] going to sign up with a new account. So,
[00:17] I'm going to log out and sign up as a
[00:19] new user. Okay, there we go. We are now
[00:21] activated. So, I'm going to come up here
[00:22] to services and I am going to add a new
[00:24] service. What we're going to do is just
[00:25] type in Nadn and it's going to be a
[00:27] really quick oneclick install.
[00:29] Basically, I'm going to just be
[00:30] deploying on HNER as a cloud provider.
[00:32] I'm going to switch to my region. And
[00:34] then you have different options for
[00:35] service plans. Then I went ahead and
[00:37] called this NAN- demo. What you can do
[00:39] here is you can add more volume. So if
[00:41] you wanted to, you could increase the
[00:42] amount of storage. And as you can see
[00:43] down here, it's going to increase your
[00:45] hourly price. I'm not going to do that,
[00:46] but you do have that option. Here I'm
[00:48] going to click create service. We're
[00:49] deploying your service. Please wait. And
[00:51] this is basically just going to take a
[00:52] few minutes to spin up. But what we're
[00:53] going to do is come down here to our
[00:54] network. And this is our actual domain
[00:56] to go to. So if I select all of this and
[00:58] I just click go to this app, it's going
[01:01] to spin up our NN environment. And
[01:02] because this is the first time we're
[01:03] visiting it, we just have to do the
[01:05] setup. So what's next is we need to
[01:06] install a community node. So if you come
[01:08] down here to your settings and you click
[01:10] on settings, we can go all the way down
[01:12] here to community nodes. And now we have
[01:14] to install a community node. So in the
[01:16] description, we have the GitHub
[01:17] repository for this NAND nodes MCP that
[01:19] was made by Nerding. But all we have to
[01:21] do is basically just copy this line
[01:22] right here. I'm just going to copy
[01:25] naden-nodes-mc. Click on install a
[01:27] community node. Put that in there. And
[01:28] so the reason you can only do this on
[01:29] self-hosted is because these nodes are
[01:31] not a native verified node from n. So
[01:34] it's just like, you know, we're
[01:36] downloading it from a public source, at
[01:37] least the code. And then we hit install.
[01:39] Package installed. We can now see we
[01:40] have one community node which is the
[01:42] MCP. Cool. So I'm going to leave my
[01:44] settings and I'm going to open up a new
[01:46] workflow. And we're just going to hit
[01:47] tab to see if we have the actual node.
[01:49] So if I type in MCP, we can see that we
[01:51] have MCP client and we have this little
[01:53] block which just means that it is part
[01:54] of the community node. So obviously we
[01:56] have the operation but we haven't set up
[01:58] a credential yet. So now what you're
[02:00] going to do is go to a different link in
[02:01] the description which is the GitHub
[02:03] repository for different MCP servers.
[02:06] And we can pretty much connect to any of
[02:07] these like I said without having to run
[02:10] any code in our terminal and install
[02:11] some stuff. I think first we'll start
[02:13] off with Airbnb because this one is
[02:14] going to be free. You don't even have to
[02:16] go get an API key. So you can see here
[02:17] we have a command which is npx and then
[02:19] we have an array of arguments which is
[02:21] -y this open bnb thing and then also the
[02:24] ignore robots text. So first of all I'm
[02:26] just going to grab the command which is
[02:27] npx. Copy that and then we're just going
[02:30] to paste the command right into there
[02:31] npx. So first is the dashy. Now I'm
[02:34] going to go back and grab the at@ open
[02:36] bnb put a space and then paste it in
[02:39] there. And then I'm going to put another
[02:40] space and then we're going to grab this
[02:41] last part which is the ignore robots
[02:44] txt. So it's as easy as that. As you can
[02:46] see, there are two tools. The first one
[02:47] is Airbnb search and then the second one
[02:49] is Airbnb listing details. If you want
[02:51] to see the full breakdown, I'll put the
[02:53] link to the video in the description.
