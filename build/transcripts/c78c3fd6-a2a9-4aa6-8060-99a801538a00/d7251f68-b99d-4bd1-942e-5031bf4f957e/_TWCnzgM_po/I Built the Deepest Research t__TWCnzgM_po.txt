[00:00] I just built the deepest research system
[00:02] in Naden. All right, so all we have to
[00:03] do is hit test workflow and this form
[00:05] will pop up and we just have to enter a
[00:06] search topic for a deep research report.
[00:08] So here I'm typing in sugar for
[00:10] breakfast, just putting in an email to
[00:11] send the report to and we'll hit submit.
[00:13] And now the workflow has started. The
[00:15] first thing we're doing is we're hitting
[00:16] a planning topic agent that has taken
[00:18] our search topic and it's spitting out
[00:20] five different in-depth search topics.
[00:22] And then we're having an agent create an
[00:23] introduction in the different chapters
[00:24] so that we can send them off to the
[00:26] different types of research agents for
[00:28] each chapter to make this a really
[00:29] in-depth analysis. So as you can see,
[00:31] we're just firing off to this first
[00:32] branch, which is chapter 1. We're doing
[00:34] our research with Tavi on five different
[00:35] topics within that chapter. And now we
[00:37] have an agent writing it all together.
[00:39] So this process is pretty much the same
[00:40] for each of the five chapters. So I'll
[00:42] be back when they're finished up. Okay,
[00:43] so the chapter 5 writer is finishing up
[00:45] right now. As you can see, we're pushing
[00:47] all of this data into Google Sheets so
[00:48] we can pull it all back later. as you'll
[00:50] see up here. Now, we're finalizing all
[00:52] this content. So, we're pulling in all
[00:53] the sources so we can make a source
[00:55] section at the bottom of our report with
[00:56] a numbered list. Then, we're going to be
[00:58] sending those back to the Google sheet.
[01:00] We'll be pulling in all the contents
[01:01] once again so that we can make a table
[01:03] of contents based on the chapters and
[01:04] based on the different subjects within
[01:06] each of the chapters. Finally, we just
[01:08] combined all that content together.
[01:10] We're hitting off the API call to make
[01:12] that PDF and we should be getting an
[01:14] email any second now. Okay, so we're
[01:15] going to hop over to the Gmail and we
[01:17] can see we got a new email, deep
[01:18] research report, sugar for breakfast.
[01:20] And once we open the downloaded PDF, we
[01:22] can see that this is a 40-page PDF. So,
[01:24] it's going to start off with a title,
[01:26] the breakfast sugar dilemma,
[01:27] understanding the impact of morning
[01:28] sugar consumption on health and
[01:30] wellness. We have a quick introduction
[01:31] right here talking about the breakfast
[01:33] landscape and how it's evolved. And then
[01:34] it says that this report delves into the
[01:36] physiological impacts of morning sugar
[01:38] consumption, explores hidden sugar
[01:40] sources and common breakfast foods, blah
[01:42] blah blah. And then we have a table of
[01:43] contents. So, as you can see, each
[01:45] chapter has five different sections. So,
[01:46] you can quickly skim and see which ones
[01:48] sort of peique your interest. And what
[01:50] you'll notice is that every section has
[01:51] a source. So, if we open up this link,
[01:54] we can see it brings us to an article
[01:55] about the association between sugar at
[01:57] breakfast and energy. And you can see
[01:58] that it's not just pulling back general
[02:00] articles, it's pulling back research
[02:01] findings and studies and experiments.
[02:03] So, here's one with um an actual
[02:05] experiment. We can open this one up, and
[02:06] you can see this source talks about an
[02:08] actual study they did and what they
[02:09] found. Anyways, let's scroll all the way
[02:11] down to the bottom on page 40 where we
[02:13] can see we should have a sources section
[02:14] that should be numbered for all the
[02:16] sources that we just looked at. So, as
[02:17] you can see, we have 1 through 25 and
[02:19] you can see right here that the last
[02:20] source we have is indeed number five.
[02:23] But all of these are also clickable
[02:24] links. If you want to watch the full
[02:26] breakdown or even just download the
[02:27] template for free, then check the link
[02:28] in the description for the full video.
[02:30] See you guys over there.
