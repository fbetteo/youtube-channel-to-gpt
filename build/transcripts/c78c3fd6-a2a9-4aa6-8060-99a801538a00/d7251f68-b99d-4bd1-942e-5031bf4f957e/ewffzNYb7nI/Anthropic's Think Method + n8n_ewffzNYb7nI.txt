[00:00] This is how Enthropic recommends to use
[00:01] a think tool for your AI agents. All
[00:03] right, so here is our beautiful ultimate
[00:05] assistant with the new GPT 4.1 chat
[00:07] model as well as the new think tool. All
[00:09] right, can you please create an event
[00:10] for tonight 7:00 p.m. It will be an hour
[00:13] long with Dexter Morgan. And can you
[00:14] send him an email to make sure that time
[00:16] works? Can you delete my dinner at 6
[00:18] p.m. And then can you email Michael
[00:20] Scott to let him know that I'm not going
[00:21] to make it? Okay, cool. So we just sent
[00:23] that off. Our ultimate assistant is
[00:25] going to get that message, use GBT41 in
[00:27] order to take action. And as you can
[00:29] see, it's going to hit its different
[00:30] child agents down here. So, it's using
[00:32] the contact agent to get that
[00:33] information, the email addresses. Now,
[00:35] it's going to hit calendar and email
[00:36] agent in order to delete that event,
[00:38] create the event, send off those two
[00:40] emails, and then, as you can see, it
[00:42] just used its think tool down here to
[00:43] make sure that it did everything right.
[00:45] So, the response that we got was all
[00:46] set. Your 7 p.m. meeting with Dexter
[00:48] Morgan has been scheduled, and he's also
[00:49] been emailed. The 6 p.m. dinner has been
[00:51] deleted, and Michael Scott has been
[00:53] notified that you can't make it. So
[00:54] before we go verify that, let's click
[00:56] into the Ultimate Assistant and we'll
[00:57] look at its logs because this lets us
[00:59] see exactly how it thought about what it
[01:01] needed to do and what actions it took.
[01:03] So the first thing it did was contact
[01:05] agent to get Dexter Morgan's email. And
[01:07] then it did the same thing for Michael
[01:08] Scott. Then it went to the calendar
[01:09] agent to create an event tonight for 7
[01:11] p.m. called meeting with Dexter Morgan.
[01:14] Then it went to the email agent to send
[01:15] Dexter an email to confirm if that
[01:17] works. It went to the calendar agent to
[01:18] delete the dinner. It went to the email
[01:20] agent to let Michael Scott know that
[01:22] we're not going to make it to dinner.
[01:23] And then finally, what it did is it used
[01:25] its think tool, which is basically like
[01:27] a scratch pad for your agent to write
[01:28] down its thoughts and its actions and
[01:30] just to make sure that it's aligned with
[01:32] what you asked it to do. So, what it
[01:33] wrote down here was confirmed that all
[01:35] requested actions were completed,
[01:37] created the meeting event for 7 p.m.
[01:38] with Dexter Morgan, emailed him to check
[01:40] if that time works, deleted the 6 p.m.
[01:42] dinner, and notified Michael Scott by
[01:44] email. No further steps needed unless
[01:46] user requests more. So, if at this point
[01:48] it realized, okay, I wrote down what I
[01:50] did and what the user wanted. Oh, I
[01:52] actually do have more things I need to
[01:53] do. I'm going to go back and call those
[01:54] tools until I'm ready to go. So, this
[01:56] was perfect. It did its actions. It
[01:58] thought about it, and it decided that we
[01:59] were finished, and then it let us know
[02:01] all the things you just requested have
[02:02] been done. So, looking at my calendar,
[02:03] you can see the 6 p.m. dinner was
[02:05] deleted, and we now have a meeting with
[02:06] Dexter Morgan, and we can see that he
[02:07] was in fact invited. You can see here in
[02:09] our sent emails, we have a meeting time
[02:11] confirmation for Dexter and 7:00 p.m.
[02:13] So, I'm super excited to continue to
[02:15] experiment with this kind of stuff. When
[02:16] you pair a really nice model with the
[02:18] ability to basically write down its
[02:19] thoughts and reason, I think that this
[02:21] is going to be huge for creating agentic
[02:23] systems. If you want to watch the full
[02:24] breakdown, the link for that will be
[02:26] down in the description. And I'll see
[02:27] you guys over there.
