[00:00] here's how you can locally host deep
[00:01] seek R1 in n8n in under a minute so step
[00:04] one is that we have to have our n8n
[00:06] self-hosted and the easiest way to do
[00:07] this is to go over to the nadn
[00:09] self-hosted AI starter kit so the first
[00:10] thing you want to do is go to doer. and
[00:12] download the desktop app if you choose
[00:14] to do Docker we're going to be using the
[00:15] nadn self-hosted AI starter kit so we're
[00:18] going to do Docker here but you're going
[00:19] to download the docker desktop for your
[00:21] system and then you're going to go over
[00:23] to the GitHub self-hosted AI starter kit
[00:25] and all you're going to have to do is
[00:26] copy a few commands into your terminal
[00:27] and run them okay now to access locally
[00:29] host posted models we're going to add an
[00:31] AMA chat model we go to ama.com and you
[00:34] don't even have to download it all we
[00:35] have to do is click on models copy the
[00:37] actual name of the model right here so
[00:38] we're going to click into AMA but all
[00:40] we're going to do is type in ama pull
[00:43] and then we can copy in that deep seek
[00:45] model that we want and now it's going to
[00:47] go through the process of actually
[00:48] pulling that in and right now it's
[00:49] installing it locally on your machine
[00:51] now we have deep seek R1 1.5 bilon
[00:54] parameters so we can go ahead and test
[00:55] this guy out let's give it um sort of a
[00:58] riddle to reason through
