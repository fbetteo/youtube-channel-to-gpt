[00:00] I'm growing three short form channels on
[00:01] autopilot using this NAND automation.
[00:04] All right, so I'm just going to go ahead
[00:05] and hit execute workflow. And this is
[00:06] basically going to pull in a database of
[00:08] past fruits or objects that we've used.
[00:10] The idea agent is choosing an object and
[00:13] a caption. And now the prompt agent is
[00:15] creating that highquality texttovideo
[00:18] prompt. We fed that into Google V3 and
[00:20] now we just got to wait. So I'll check
[00:21] back in once this step is done. All
[00:23] right, so the video just finished up.
[00:25] Now we're moving on to that third part
[00:26] where it's going to update our sheet and
[00:27] then post to socials. So right now it's
[00:29] getting uploaded to Blot, posting to
[00:31] YouTube, posting to Tik Tok, and posted
[00:33] to Instagram. So let's go take a look at
[00:34] the final video.
[00:42] All right, there you go. So that's what
[00:43] one output looks like. Let's flip back
[00:45] over to the workflow and let's kind of
[00:47] go over how I built this thing. If you
