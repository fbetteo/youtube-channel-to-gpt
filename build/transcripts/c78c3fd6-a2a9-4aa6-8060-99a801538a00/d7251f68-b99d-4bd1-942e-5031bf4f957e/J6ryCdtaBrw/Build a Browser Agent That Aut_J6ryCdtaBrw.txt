[00:00] This AI agent can use a computer just
[00:01] like a human would. As you can see, if
[00:03] we take a look at its browser tools, it
[00:05] can start up a browser. It can click,
[00:07] type, query, load windows, and also end
[00:10] those sessions. So, the whole point of
[00:11] this agent is to take web actions with
[00:13] completely natural language. Let's hop
[00:15] into a quick demo so I can show you guys
[00:16] what I mean by that, and then we'll
[00:17] break down how this agent works. So,
[00:19] what I'm going to do here is ask this
[00:20] agent to find posts on X about Google
[00:22] V3. So, I wanted to move over our agent
[00:24] because what it's going to do real quick
[00:25] is it's going to use its start browser
[00:27] tool to spin up a browser in airtop. And
[00:30] when it does that, it's going to give us
[00:31] a link in our Slack where we can
[00:33] actually click onto that and we can
[00:34] watch the agent move around in a
[00:36] browser. So, it's going to be really
[00:37] cool. So, now that that browser has
[00:38] started, we got the link and it's going
[00:40] to load up that session and then we're
[00:41] going to be able to watch the agent
[00:42] actually do things. So, right here you
[00:44] can see that it's using its type tool.
[00:46] So, it's probably going to move its
[00:47] mouse all the way up here, click on the
[00:49] search bar, and then type in Google V3,
[00:51] and then it will hit enter. So, we can
[00:53] search for Google
[00:55] V3. As you can see, there goes the
[00:57] mouse. We're going to click onto it.
[00:58] It's typing Google V3, and bam, now we
[01:01] are searching X. And if you guys will
[01:03] notice, I'm actually logged in down here
[01:04] in the bottom left. You can tell I'm
[01:06] logged into one of my Twitter accounts.
[01:08] So, that means that even if you need to
[01:09] be on a site where you have
[01:11] authentication, you can still automate
[01:13] that with AirTop. And already the
[01:15] browser is being ended right now because
[01:17] we already got our results back. So
[01:19] here's what the agent came up with based
[01:20] on search results from X. Here's what I
[01:22] found about Google V3. Found latest
[01:24] features. V3 now includes native audio
[01:27] generation capabilities. We found
[01:29] availability and reception. It's
[01:30] released in 7 to three countries through
[01:32] the Gemini app. And finally, we found
[01:34] technical notes. It builds upon previous
[01:35] V2 capabilities. If you want to watch
[01:37] the full video, click that play button
[01:39] right here. And I'll see you guys over
[01:40] there.
