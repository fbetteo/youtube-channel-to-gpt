[00:00] This AI agent can create and edit
[00:01] images, videos, and LinkedIn and blog
[00:04] posts. Can you please create a blog post
[00:06] about the effect of sleep on
[00:08] productivity? All right, we'll send that
[00:10] off. And while this is running after,
[00:11] we'll just see that it's hitting the
[00:12] blog post workflow. Okay, so the agent
[00:15] just finished up. Let's click into the
[00:16] Telegram and we'll see what we got.
[00:17] Here's our graphic. Well-rested minds
[00:19] get more done. You can see it has some
[00:21] up arrows and stuff like that. And then
[00:22] we have our actual blog post. And at the
[00:24] bottom, it includes some references for
[00:26] us. And if we click into our log, we can
[00:28] see that we have our actual blog post.
[00:30] And you can see I did the same example
[00:32] earlier, and this is what the picture
[00:33] looked like. So, this one was a
[00:34] different type of graphic that had some
[00:36] more statistics in there. But then this
[00:37] one that we just did looks like this.
[00:39] And they're both still very good
[00:41] graphics that I would definitely feel
[00:42] confident posting with a blog. And then
[00:44] finally, let's just do a quick video.
[00:46] So, can you please create a video of a
[00:48] beaver building a house? So, we'll send
[00:50] that off and we'll see what happens. And
[00:51] then while this is running, I just
[00:53] wanted to explain something to you guys
[00:54] here. So it's calling the video workflow
[00:56] which looks like this. And this run
[00:58] takes
[00:59] typically 2 to 3 minutes, maybe even a
[01:02] little more. We have these waits because
[01:03] we have to wait for the images to be
[01:04] generated as well as the videos to be
[01:06] generated. And so what actually happens
[01:08] is the actual marketing agent right
[01:10] here. As you can see, it's waiting. This
[01:12] guy times out and then we don't get a
[01:14] response back right here. So what I've
[01:15] done is we actually get the response in
[01:17] the form of this workflow. So this is
[01:19] where it will download the video, send
[01:21] it to us on Telegram, and then also log
[01:22] the outputs. Obviously, you can see that
[01:24] we still got the video. So, let's click
[01:26] into this and watch it real
[01:28] quick. We got some nice sound
[01:32] effects. Okay, looks like he's building
[01:34] a dam, not a house. I was kind of hoping
[01:36] for more of an actual house, but there
[01:38] we go. At the end, he's got a finished
[01:39] house. If you want to watch the full
