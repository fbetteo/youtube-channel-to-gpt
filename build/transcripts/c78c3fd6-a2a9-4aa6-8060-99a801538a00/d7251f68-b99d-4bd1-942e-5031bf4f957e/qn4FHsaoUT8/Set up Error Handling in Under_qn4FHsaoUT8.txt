[00:00] This is how you can set up error
[00:01] workflows in Nadn in under a minute. All
[00:03] right, so here's the workflow that we're
[00:04] going to be using today as our test
[00:05] workflow that we're going to purposely
[00:07] make error and then we're going to
[00:08] capture those errors in a different one
[00:10] and feed that into a Google sheet
[00:11] template as well as some sort of Slack
[00:13] or email notification. Okay, so you guys
[00:15] are going to be pretty surprised by how
[00:16] simple this workflow is going to be. I'm
[00:17] going to add a first step and I'm going
[00:19] to type an error. And as you can see,
[00:20] there's an error trigger which says
[00:22] triggers the workflow when another
[00:23] workflow has an error. So quickly pay
[00:25] attention to the fact that I named this
[00:27] workflow error logger. I'm going to go
[00:29] back into my Ultimate Assistant Active
[00:31] Workflow. Up in the top right, I'm going
[00:32] to click on these three dots, go down to
[00:34] settings, and then right here, there's a
[00:35] setting called error workflow, which as
[00:37] you can see, a second workflow to run if
[00:39] the current one fails. The second
[00:41] workflow should always start with an
[00:43] error trigger. So, all I have to do is
[00:44] choose a workflow. I'm going to type an
[00:46] error, and we called it error logger.
[00:48] So, I'm going to choose that one, hit
[00:50] save, and now these two workflows are
[00:51] basically linked so that if this
[00:53] workflow ever has an error that stops
[00:55] the workflow, it's going to be captured
[00:57] in our second one over here with the
[00:59] information. So, let's see a quick
[01:00] example of that. So, let's once again
[01:02] say, hey, and we should see that
[01:04] nothing's going to come back over here.
[01:05] Um, I believe if we go into our error
[01:07] logger, we should see something pop
[01:08] through. We just got that row. And you
[01:10] can see the node changed, the error
[01:12] message changed, all that kind of stuff.
[01:14] And then in Slack, we got another
[01:15] workflow error at a new time and it was
[01:17] a different node.
