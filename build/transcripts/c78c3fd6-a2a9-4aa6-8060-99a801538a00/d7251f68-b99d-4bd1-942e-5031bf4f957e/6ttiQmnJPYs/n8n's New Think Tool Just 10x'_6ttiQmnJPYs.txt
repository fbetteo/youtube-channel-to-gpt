[00:00] NN's new think tool makes your agent so
[00:02] much smarter. Okay, so here is our think
[00:03] agent. As you can see, it has two tools
[00:05] as well as a think tool. So, what I'm
[00:07] going to do in this chat is ask it if me
[00:09] and three friends can stay from April
[00:11] 15th to April 20th. So, we'll send that
[00:13] off and we'll see what it does. You're
[00:14] going to see here that it's going to
[00:15] call both the quoter and the
[00:16] availability tool. And then it's going
[00:18] to hit the think tool. And then you'll
[00:19] notice it hit the quotot. So, as you can
[00:22] see, it responds to us with you and your
[00:23] three friends, four guests total can
[00:25] stay from April 15th to the 20th. Those
[00:27] dates are available. However, I was
[00:29] unable to retrieve a quote for your
[00:30] requested stay at this time. If we click
[00:32] into the logs of the actual agent, we
[00:34] will see exactly what it did. You can
[00:36] see that it first called the
[00:36] availability tool, which the response is
[00:38] that the dates are available. It then
[00:40] tried to call the quot tool, and the
[00:42] response was no quote provided. So, the
[00:44] agent at this point realized, okay, I
[00:45] ran into an issue. I'm going to use this
[00:47] think tool to think about what I need to
[00:48] do. Basically, what this is is a scratch
[00:50] pad for the agent just to write
[00:51] something down and think about it. So,
[00:53] we're essentially turning GPT41, which
[00:55] is not a reasoning model, into a
[00:57] reasoning model. What it wrote down was
[00:58] availability has been confirmed, but the
[01:00] quote was not provided. I need to retry
[01:02] the quote request with the correct
[01:04] number of guests and dates. So, it's
[01:05] thinking, okay, maybe I just sent over
[01:07] the wrong information. Let me go ahead
[01:08] and try again. What it did is it called
[01:10] the quoter tool once again. And same
[01:12] thing, no quote provided. And so, what I
[01:14] just did is I fixed the quotot. So,
[01:16] let's go ahead and resend this off and
[01:17] see if we get anything different. It
[01:19] should call both these tools and then it
[01:20] should call the think tool just to make
[01:22] sure that it did everything correctly.
[01:23] As you can see, it just called the think
[01:24] tool. And now we have our actual
[01:26] availability with the quote. If you want
[01:28] to watch the full video, the link for
[01:30] that's down in the description.
