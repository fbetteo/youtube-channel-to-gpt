[00:00] All right. So, here we have our NEN
[00:01] developer AI agent and I'm just going to
[00:02] open up a chat, send off this message,
[00:04] build me an AI agent that will receive a
[00:06] message in Slack, interpret the message,
[00:08] and decide if it needs to use its
[00:09] calendar or its Gmail tool, then log the
[00:11] results in Google Sheets, and send us a
[00:13] message back in Slack. So, I'll check in
[00:14] with you guys when that's finished up.
[00:16] Wow. I mean, that is absurd. We've got a
[00:18] Slack trigger set up that feeds into an
[00:19] AI agent that has a chat model, memory,
[00:22] Gmail tool, calendar tool, and a
[00:24] structured output parser. Then, we have
[00:26] our Google Sheets logger, and finally, a
[00:28] message back in Slack. You can also see
[00:30] that we have tons of sticky notes so
[00:31] we're able to get set up and we
[00:33] understand what exactly needs to be
[00:34] configured. So as you can see the
[00:36] workflow tells us how to get started. We
[00:37] need to configure all the credentials
[00:38] which is everything that's red. We need
[00:40] to set up the Google sheet with proper
[00:41] headers. We need to add the Slackbot to
[00:43] our channel and then just start testing.
[00:45] It also tells us what to do with the
[00:47] Slack trigger, what to do with the AI
[00:48] agent, what to do with these tools down
[00:50] here. But I mean this is wild. If we
[00:51] click into the AI agent, we can see that
[00:53] it has the proper user message already
[00:55] mapped and it also has a system prompt.
[00:57] So let's open this up real quick. It's
[00:58] not too in-depth, but it says you're a
[00:59] helpful AI assistant that helps with
[01:01] calendar and email tasks. It lists the
[01:03] two tools, which are calendar and Gmail,
[01:05] and always provide a clear explanation
[01:07] of what action you took, and what the
[01:08] result was. If you guys remember, there
[01:10] was a structured output parser already
[01:12] attached. And if we click into here, we
[01:14] can see that the agent's going to output
[01:15] the action that was performed, which
[01:17] tool was used, a summary of the result,
[01:19] and the message to send back to the user
[01:21] in Slack. If you want to watch the full
