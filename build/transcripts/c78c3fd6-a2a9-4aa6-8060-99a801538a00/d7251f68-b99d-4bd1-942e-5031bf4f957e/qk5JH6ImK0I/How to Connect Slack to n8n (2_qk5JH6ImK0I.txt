[00:00] So, this is the quickest and easiest way
[00:01] to connect Slack to any event. So, I'm
[00:03] setting up a new Slack workspace. So,
[00:04] you guys know I'm walking through every
[00:06] single step. So, I just gave it a name.
[00:07] I'm giving it my name. I don't need to
[00:09] invite anyone else. I'm creating my
[00:10] first channel and I'm starting with the
[00:12] limited free version. Okay. So, now that
[00:14] we have this connected, all we have to
[00:15] do is come down here to the apps and
[00:16] click on add apps. Now, we're going to
[00:18] go to browse apps. So, this pulls up our
[00:20] Slack Workspaces app section where we
[00:22] can click on build. We can click on your
[00:23] apps and then we're able to create a new
[00:25] one. Okay. So, here we are. You can
[00:26] ignore these other apps that are
[00:27] assigned to a different workspace. You
[00:29] can also get here by going to
[00:31] api.slack.com/apps. And now we're just
[00:33] going to click create new app. We're
[00:34] going to start building one from
[00:35] scratch. We're going to give this app a
[00:36] name and assign it to a specific
[00:38] workspace. So here you can see I'm
[00:39] assigning it to the workspace I just
[00:40] made. We're going to hit create app. And
[00:42] then it pulls up this configuration
[00:43] panel. And now it may look like there's
[00:45] a lot going on, but we're going to break
[00:46] it down. It's not too difficult. So
[00:48] first I just wanted to talk about we
[00:49] have two things that we're going to
[00:50] connect here. One is going to be a
[00:52] trigger that's going to be listening to
[00:53] our Slack channel, and one is just going
[00:54] to be the ability to send messages to a
[00:56] Slack channel. So, if we click into this
[00:58] send message one first and we go up here
[01:00] to create a new credential, we can see
[01:02] that we can just sign in with OOTH 2.
[01:03] So, if I click connect my account, it's
[01:05] going to pull it up right here and it's
[01:06] going to have a message saying here is
[01:08] like what NADN wants to have permission
[01:10] to within your Slack workspace. I'm also
[01:12] going to change the workspace to the one
[01:13] we just made. And now you can see these
[01:15] are the different permissions. All I
[01:17] have to do is click allow and we will
[01:18] have connected successfully. And there
[01:20] we go. We get two green messages and I
[01:22] want to verify that by clicking into the
[01:24] channels. However, we can't see them
[01:25] yet. So the reason why it doesn't work
[01:27] yet is because we haven't given it
[01:28] permission. Okay. So back in this page,
[01:30] what we want to do is we want to come
[01:31] down here to OOTH and permissions and we
[01:33] want to scroll down to bot token scopes.
[01:36] We're going to add an OOTH scope which
[01:37] we will have app meions read. We also
[01:40] want to do channels read. We can do
[01:41] other things like channels join. We can
[01:43] do chat read, chat, write. This is
[01:45] basically just telling Slack and telling
[01:47] Naden what they can do. I'm going to
[01:49] leave it with these scopes for now, but
[01:51] you can get in there and basically
[01:52] customize what you want this bot to be
[01:54] able to do. So now that we have this set
[01:55] up, we can scroll up a little bit and we
[01:57] can see right here we can install to
[01:59] awesome AI stuff, which is just the
[02:00] workspace that I just made. We want to
[02:02] allow it to go into our workspace. And
[02:05] now it is in there and we have a bot
[02:07] user OOTH token. And so that's the other
[02:09] way you could have verified your account
[02:11] if you copied this token and you came
[02:12] back into Slack. And if we were to
[02:14] create a new credential, you could do an
[02:15] access token rather than the OOTH. If I
[02:17] show you guys that right here and we hit
[02:19] save and now we are going to be once
[02:20] again connected. And now we can click in
[02:22] here and see our channels. And for
[02:23] example, we can go to the YouTube
[02:25] channel, send a message of hi, and what
[02:26] you're going to see is that we have this
[02:28] error not in channel. So this just
[02:30] basically means that our app isn't in
[02:31] that YouTube channel yet. So now back in
[02:33] our Slack, we basically have to invite
[02:35] that app that we just made into this
[02:36] channel. So I'm going to do at testing
[02:38] because this is the app that we just
[02:39] made. And I'm going to say hi. And then
[02:41] it's going to prompt us to invite the
[02:43] app to the channel. So I'll just click
[02:45] add them. Now they have been added. We
[02:47] can go back into Slack, hit test step,
[02:49] and it should be able to send that
[02:50] message in our channel because we've now
[02:52] added the user and he is saying hi.
[02:55] Okay, cool. So, that's sending messages.
[02:56] Now, let's talk about how we can set up
[02:58] this web hook over here so that we can
[02:59] have a workflow trigger from Slack. So,
[03:02] we'll click into here, and we can see
[03:03] that we have the same access token
[03:04] already configured, but now we have to
[03:06] configure the web hook. So, what we're
[03:08] going to do is click this web hook real
[03:09] quick to copy it to our clipboard. We're
[03:11] going to go back into the nasty page of
[03:14] OOTH and permissions we were looking at,
[03:15] but now we're going to go to event
[03:16] subscription. So, right below OOTH and
[03:18] permissions, and we want to enable
[03:20] events. What we're going to do is paste
[03:22] in that web hook right here that we just
[03:23] copied and now it's going to verify it.
[03:25] So, back in Nit, I'm quickly just going
[03:27] to choose a channel. So, we'll choose
[03:28] YouTube because we already know that our
[03:30] testing app is in there. We'll hit test
[03:32] step. So, now this this trigger is
[03:33] listening. And then if we go back into
[03:35] here and we hit retry, now it's going to
[03:37] be verified. So, we should be good to go
[03:39] now. And what we want to do is open up
[03:41] this panel that says subscribe to bot
[03:43] events. And we can add a bot user event.
[03:45] That basically just says when does this
[03:47] workflow actually trigger. For now,
[03:49] let's just choose app mention. So this
[03:50] just means if we ever are in Slack and
[03:52] we say, hey, you know, I want to talk to
[03:54] our N. I'm going to do at testing and
[03:56] then I'll be able to talk. So we're
[03:57] going to save those changes. So we'll go
[03:59] back into Nitn. We can see that our
[04:00] Slack trigger is listening for us. And
[04:02] now if we go into the channel and we say
[04:04] at testing hello, send that off. It's
[04:08] going to be sent to Naden. Right here,
[04:10] it just got the message. And if we
[04:11] scroll over, we can see the text was
[04:13] hello. So, pulling it all together, when
[04:15] we mention our app in the Slack channel,
[04:17] it'll trigger this workflow. We can feed
[04:19] that into something like an AI agent
[04:20] where we're just going to drag in the
[04:21] text that we send. So, right here, in
[04:23] this case, I'm dragging in that variable
[04:24] from the left Slack trigger into the
[04:26] prompt user message so the agent can
[04:28] look at it. And in this case, it's
[04:29] looking at the text hello. And then what
[04:31] we want to do is we want to configure on
[04:33] this right hand side the response from
[04:35] the agent back to Slack. So if I just
[04:37] run this quick node, the agent will
[04:39] respond with, "Hello, how can I help you
[04:40] today?" And if we open up the Slack
[04:42] message, we can respond with what the
[04:44] agent responded to us with. So if we
[04:46] drag in the agents output right here as
[04:48] the message text and we hit test step,
[04:51] we can see that that message will be
[04:52] sent over to Slack. And in this case, it
[04:54] just said, "Hello, how can I help you
[04:55] today?" So let's just do a full live run
[04:57] now that we have everything set up.
[04:59] We're going to hit test workflow. So
[05:00] Slack is listening for us. I'm going to
[05:02] come into here. We're going to at the
[05:04] testing app and say, "Tell me a joke."
[05:08] And then as soon as I send this off,
[05:09] we're going to go back in here. We'll
[05:11] see this message come into Slack, hit
[05:13] the agent, and respond to our Slack
[05:14] channel. And if we switch back in here,
[05:16] it says, "Why don't scientists trust
[05:18] Adam atoms?" Because they make up
[05:19] everything. Real quick, last thing I
[05:20] wanted to mention is that what we did in
[05:22] here is we put in our URL, which was a
[05:24] web hook test URL. Meaning, if we were
[05:26] to come in here and make this workflow
[05:28] active, it would no longer be working
[05:30] because this trigger is going to switch
[05:31] over to the production URL. So, whenever
[05:34] you do go to make this workflow active,
[05:36] all you have to do is that exact same
[05:37] step we did where you're going to click
[05:39] this, copy it, change the URL, paste it
[05:42] in here, and let it verify, and then
[05:43] you'll be good to go. So, that's really
[05:45] all there is to it. If this video helped
[05:46] you out, please give it a like.
[05:48] Definitely helps me out a ton.
[05:49] Appreciate you guys making it to the
[05:50] end, and I'll see you in the next one.
[05:51] Thanks.
