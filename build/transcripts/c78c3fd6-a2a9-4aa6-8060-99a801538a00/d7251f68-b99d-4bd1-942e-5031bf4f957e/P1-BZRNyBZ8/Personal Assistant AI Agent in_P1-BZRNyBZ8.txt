[00:00] I just built this personal assistant AI
[00:01] agent in nadn using no code can you
[00:03] please create a calendar event for
[00:05] tomorrow with Michael Scott at noon for
[00:06] a meeting and then can you email him to
[00:08] confirm if that time works and then
[00:09] finally can you grab all of my calendar
[00:10] events for the rest of today thanks okay
[00:13] so we just sent that off to telegram
[00:14] it's transcribing that audio it's now
[00:16] hitting the personal assistant and the
[00:18] assistant is going to take the contact
[00:19] information it's going to create that
[00:21] calendar event with Michael Scott now
[00:23] it's going to hit the email agent so
[00:25] that it can send out that email to
[00:26] confirm if that time works and then
[00:28] finally it should come back to us with a
[00:30] text message as well as a voice file or
[00:32] an audio file that's going to be telling
[00:34] us about what we asked for so here's the
[00:36] information the calendar event was
[00:37] created the email was sent we've got our
[00:39] information about the remaining events
[00:40] for today and now as you can see that
[00:43] audio file is being created so let's
[00:44] listen to that real quick a calendar
[00:46] event has been created for a meeting
[00:48] with Michael Scott scheduled for
[00:50] tomorrow if you want to find out how you
