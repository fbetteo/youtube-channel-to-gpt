[00:00] so let's go ahead and throw a query at
[00:01] this travel agent and we will see what
[00:02] we get we're asking for it to plan a
[00:04] 5-day trip to Paris with a budget of
[00:06] $2,000 so let's see it's hitting the
[00:08] openai reasoning model right now first
[00:10] of all it's hitting the resort so it
[00:12] just grab Resort information it's going
[00:13] back to open ai's model to see what to
[00:15] do next it's going to hit either the
[00:17] flights database or the activities
[00:19] database to continue planning this
[00:20] itenerary for us it needs to gather all
[00:22] the information um like I said to
[00:24] structure that itinerary um human readly
[00:26] so now we've got flights information
[00:28] we've got activities information and
[00:29] finally right now it's formatting that
[00:31] into HTML structure and then it's going
[00:32] to hit the send itenerary Gmail tool in
[00:35] order to actually send that out to us
[00:36] and then we'll be able to take a look at
[00:38] what it what it did okay there we go so
[00:40] we just saw it hit the send itenerary
[00:41] Gmail tool now it finished up we'll see
[00:43] what it said back to us looks like you
[00:45] received the itenerary email please
[00:47] check your inbox for the detailed 5day
[00:49] trip to Paris so let's go ahead and
[00:51] check that out in our Gmail all right as
[00:53] you can see we just got this email back
[00:54] the subject is your 5-day Paris trip I
[00:56] tenary with a budget of $2,000 so that's
[00:58] great it keeps that into account when
[01:00] it's going through and reasoning how to
[01:01] make this itinerary so we've got our
[01:03] travel and flight details we're flying
[01:04] Air France we've got our routes and
[01:07] we've got the departure and return time
[01:08] and we have our price then we have
[01:10] accommodation for a comfortable
[01:11] centrally located stay we recommend a
[01:13] budget friendly hotel such as Hotel IIs
[01:15] Paris um or similar so we've got that
[01:17] information 600 700 bucks and then we
[01:19] have a day-by-day itinerary remember we
[01:21] asked for a 5-day trip so it planned out
[01:23] 5 days um we have different activities
[01:26] here morning afternoon evening um we
[01:28] have even different options down here it
[01:29] gives us option A and option b stuff
[01:31] like that and then it's going to give us
[01:32] a summary at the end of here's the
[01:34] flight here's the accommodation here's
[01:35] your expenses um and it's pretty much
[01:37] keeping everything about $2,000 like we
[01:39] asked for in the beginning and as you
[01:41] can see um it's a really nicely
[01:42] formatted itinerary for us so yesterday
[01:45] open AI just released 03 mini which is
[01:47] their newest most cost-efficient
[01:49] reasoning model to date it seems like
[01:51] this may have been a direct response to
[01:52] all the models that deeps has been
[01:54] releasing lately that have completely
[01:55] took the World by storm and made
[01:57] everyone sell their shares of Nvidia
[01:59] anyways what's really cool about 03 is
[02:01] that it's their first small reasoning
[02:02] model that supports highly requested
[02:04] developer features including function
[02:06] calling structured outputs and developer
[02:08] messages making it production ready
[02:10] right out of the gate this model is
[02:11] super fast and powerful and optimized
[02:13] for stem reasoning as you can see it's
[02:15] outperforming 01 in math in PhD level
[02:18] science questions in um competition code
[02:21] all this kind of stuff I'll leave the
[02:22] link to this open aai release um
[02:25] information Down Below in the
[02:26] description if you want to check it out
[02:27] for yourself but we don't want to spend
[02:28] too much time here what we want to do is
[02:30] we want to get into nadn plug it into an
[02:32] agent with different tools and see how
[02:33] it works so that's exactly what we're
[02:35] going to be doing here today as you can
[02:36] see I built out a travel agent it's
[02:38] accessing these three different
[02:39] databases in Pine Cone that have
[02:41] information on Resorts information on
[02:42] flights and then information about
[02:44] different activities to do based on
[02:45] where you are and um finally it's going
[02:48] to take all that information and then
[02:49] put it into an HTML formatted email and
[02:51] then send out that itinerary based on
[02:54] the user input of course which in here
[02:55] we're just chat chatting with a trigger
[02:57] with an nadn so we played around with
[02:59] deep see we've seen that it's been
[03:00] really really cool but when you try to
[03:02] hook up tools to an agent it's not
[03:03] really supported for that so it'll be
[03:05] really cool to see how o03 mini performs
[03:07] when we give it access to these four
[03:09] different tools and it also has that
[03:10] aspect of reasoning through and creating
[03:12] hopefully a really really nicely
[03:14] structured itinerary based on all the
[03:16] information it's going to get from these
[03:17] databases and what the we ask for up
[03:20] front so of course step one is to
[03:21] connect our AI agent to open ai's new
[03:24] model which is 03 so if we wanted to
[03:26] click on this chat model and we go down
[03:27] to open AI chat model what see here is
[03:30] that let me just fix the credential
[03:32] because that wasn't my open a credential
[03:33] but anyways what we'll see here is that
[03:35] we don't have 03 mini yet so this is
[03:37] just because it's so new um we may get a
[03:39] preview out here or something soon it
[03:41] literally just released yesterday um and
[03:43] so if you're watching this video later
[03:45] it will probably be here but for now we
[03:46] have a really easy solution which is um
[03:49] we can just connect to open router which
[03:52] thanks to the update that also happened
[03:54] yesterday or the day before um we have
[03:56] the native open a open router chat model
[03:58] now so this is really cool
[04:00] all you have to do is go to open router
[04:02] you will click up in the top right after
[04:03] you make an account go to Keys create a
[04:06] new key copy that into your credential
[04:08] section right here when you go to create
[04:10] a new credential paste that key in there
[04:12] and then you'll have all the models to
[04:13] choose from and as you can see right
[04:14] here we have open AI 03 mini what's also
[04:17] really cool about open router is that
[04:18] once you are using different models you
[04:20] can click on activity and you can see
[04:22] which ones you're using you can see how
[04:23] much they're costing you all that kind
[04:24] of stuff so as you can see I've been
[04:25] playing around with open AI 03 mini it's
[04:27] been about 007
[04:30] per input and output um so it's
[04:32] definitely not too expensive so you saw
[04:34] a demo in the beginning of this video
[04:35] Let's really quickly break down what's
[04:37] actually going on within this workflow
[04:39] and um and then we'll do one more test
[04:41] at the end so what we've got here like I
[04:43] said is three different pine cone
[04:44] databases so if you were really wanting
[04:46] to build out a travel agent you'd
[04:47] probably want to hook it up to different
[04:49] apis that can go scrape for Resorts go
[04:51] scrape for flights go scrape for
[04:52] activities for the say this video I just
[04:54] want to throw something together quick
[04:56] and the purpose is still the same of can
[04:58] 03 reason through the prompt reason
[05:01] through its system message and
[05:03] understand how to hit tools and how to
[05:04] pull information back and clearly it
[05:06] does because it hits all these three
[05:07] tools formats the information into HTML
[05:10] email and then sends it off with the
[05:11] other tool so it's doing four Total Tool
[05:13] calls here so as far as the databases go
[05:15] like I said they're on Pine Cone there
[05:17] are three different Nam spaces this Nam
[05:19] space is Resorts this Nam space is
[05:21] flights and then the last one of course
[05:22] is activities and if we switch over to
[05:24] my pine cone real quick you can see I've
[05:26] got activities flights and Resorts so
[05:28] that's how we hooked up these three
[05:29] different databases to this agent and if
[05:31] you want to replicate this experiment in
[05:33] your own an instance you can download
[05:35] this workflow for free as well as this
[05:36] workflow that I used to push the
[05:38] documents into pine cone all you have to
[05:40] do is join my free school Community once
[05:41] you join all you'll have to do is click
[05:43] on the post associated with this
[05:44] specific video you can click into the
[05:46] Json file and download it once you have
[05:48] that file all you have to do is click on
[05:49] the top right three dots in your nadn
[05:52] click import from file and then once you
[05:54] choose that Json it'll open up right
[05:55] here for you and if you're looking to
[05:56] take your learning with nadn and a
[05:58] automations a little bit farther you're
[05:59] looking for more hands-on experience
[06:00] feel free to check out my paid Community
[06:02] the link for that will also be down in
[06:03] the description as you can see we've got
[06:04] a great community of members who are
[06:06] learning nadn and also sharing their
[06:08] resources and their challenges that
[06:09] they're facing we've got a great
[06:11] classroom section as well with different
[06:12] Deep dive topics and these resources are
[06:14] always being updated and then finally
[06:15] we've got a calendar with five live
[06:16] calls per week which is super exciting
[06:18] we've got three Tech supports one coffee
[06:20] chat one weekly Q&A and as you can see
[06:22] in February we've already got three
[06:23] guest speakers planned which is really
[06:24] really exciting and hopefully we have
[06:26] multiple guest speakers every month so
[06:27] I'd love to see you guys in these calls
[06:29] let's get back back to the video all
[06:30] right so that's what the database looks
[06:31] like that's where it's getting its
[06:32] information and then the last thing it
[06:34] needs to do is actually send out the
[06:35] email so right now I just put my email
[06:37] it's going to be fixed so every time I
[06:39] activate this agent it's going to send
[06:40] an email to this address rather than
[06:42] being able to dynamically put that in if
[06:44] you want it to do dynamically you could
[06:45] do that super easily by making this an
[06:47] expression and then you utilize the from
[06:49] AI function that we're using in the the
[06:50] subject and the message parameters and
[06:53] just put in from Ai and then the key
[06:54] would be like an email address or
[06:56] recipient or something like that anyways
[06:58] obviously we're sending a message Mage
[07:00] and we wanted to do HTML this time
[07:02] rather than text because we could just
[07:03] get it formatted a little better a
[07:05] little more human readable for us and
[07:07] then finally we just turned off the
[07:08] append naden attribution so that at the
[07:11] bottom of the email it doesn't say that
[07:12] this was generated by naden so let's
[07:15] take a quick look at the prompt and then
[07:17] we'll send off another example and see
[07:18] what type of itenerary we get back so I
[07:20] got this prompt by using my AI agent
[07:22] prompt architect that gives us markdown
[07:24] formatted prompts as you can see I told
[07:25] it what the agent's going to do and then
[07:27] after it gave me an initial one I was
[07:28] able to say perfect now I want to add
[07:29] another tool called send itinerary so
[07:31] it's able to have that memory and work
[07:33] with us and then we could copy and paste
[07:34] this prompt straight into our AI agent
[07:37] with the markdown because that's super
[07:38] important for us to be able to
[07:39] understand as well as um saying like you
[07:41] know this is your overview this is your
[07:42] context these are instructions anyways
[07:44] so we told that you have access to four
[07:46] tools Resorts is for information about
[07:48] Resorts flights activities send
[07:50] itenerary um at the end you have to send
[07:52] the itenerary in a HTML format what we
[07:56] wanted to do is give it instructions
[07:57] because when I first started doing this
[07:58] it wasn't calling the tools or sometimes
[08:00] it was just calling one or the other so
[08:02] what we said is always call all three
[08:03] data retrieval tools before providing
[08:05] any response so use all three of the
[08:07] tools and then based on the retrieved
[08:08] information create a detailed itinerary
[08:10] that includes stuff like recommended
[08:12] Resorts flights a day-by-day breakdown
[08:14] of activities and then once the
[08:15] itenerary is logical well paced align
[08:18] with the Traveler's preferences based on
[08:20] what they say up front at the beginning
[08:22] then you can format that final itenerary
[08:23] and HTML format and send that off to the
[08:26] send itenerary Gmail tool so um very
[08:28] simple prompt here we get gave it a few
[08:29] examples and then we told it sort of how
[08:31] to structure your HTML and then just
[08:33] gave it standard operating procedures
[08:35] and final notes so I know I went through
[08:37] that quick if you want to take a little
[08:38] more in-depth look at the prompt go
[08:40] ahead and download this workflow The
[08:42] Prompt will be in there and you'll be
[08:43] able to sort of break down what's going
[08:44] on okay cool so we broke down what's
[08:46] going on within this workflow one thing
[08:48] I want to mention before we do one final
[08:49] test is that this may not be the optimal
[08:52] way to structure a travel agent because
[08:54] this kind of stuff is happening
[08:56] sequentially rather than variably so
[08:58] what I mean by that is the agent has
[09:01] autonomous decision here to use the
[09:03] different tools but in this case every
[09:05] single time we want it to check Resorts
[09:08] check flights check activities and then
[09:10] send a message so if I was really trying
[09:12] to build this out to be sort of a
[09:13] production ready agent what I would do
[09:15] is build it linearly sequentially rather
[09:17] than having this be like a parent type
[09:20] tooling uh multi-tool agent um anyways
[09:23] so what we would do is maybe have like a
[09:26] an agent that originally takes the query
[09:28] and then gets Resort information then
[09:29] passes it off to another another agent
[09:31] to get flight information and activity
[09:33] information then finally a send email
[09:34] tool um just because having that linear
[09:37] flow may cut down on sort of like errors
[09:39] and hallucination with data transfer and
[09:41] Tool calling okay so now we've got that
[09:43] out of the way let's send off one more
[09:45] query to end this one off so what we're
[09:47] saying here is I need a week-long
[09:48] vacation in Sydney Australia recommend
[09:50] flights a hotel with a pool and some
[09:52] activities so it just hit the resorts
[09:53] tool now it's going to go back to the
[09:55] model it's thinking about what to do
[09:56] next it should be understanding that it
[09:58] needs to hit flights so it can get
[09:59] flight information and then finally
[10:01] needs to get activities so it can
[10:03] recommend activities of course so it
[10:05] just hit flights um now it's going to
[10:07] activities and then it's going to pull
[10:08] that all back right now it's creating
[10:09] that HTML formatted itinerary going to
[10:12] send that off to our Gmail and then
[10:13] we'll take a look at what we got okay so
[10:14] here's what we got as you can see it
[10:16] actually formatted a little bit
[10:17] differently from the demo in the demo we
[10:18] got those horizontal bars which I really
[10:20] liked so maybe we can go back and try to
[10:22] refix that prompting but here we have
[10:24] our weeklong Sydney vacation itinerary
[10:26] um as you can see the HTML looks really
[10:27] good we've got sort of like headers and
[10:29] sub headers that kind of stuff we have
[10:30] our flight details which is a little bit
[10:32] over a week so maybe that's just because
[10:34] that's the only flight they had in the
[10:35] database um hotel accommodations we
[10:38] asked for a pool looks like this one has
[10:40] a refreshing pool and top-notch
[10:41] amenities and then we have 7 Days
[10:43] planned which are um arrival and
[10:46] relaxation landmarks Harbor Bridge Bondi
[10:49] Beach um cultural immersion adventure
[10:51] and nature and then Leisure and
[10:53] Department preparation also this one
[10:55] didn't sign off the same way the other
[10:56] one did where it was like best regards
[10:58] your travel team or whatever so there's
[11:00] a little bit of variability here like I
[11:02] said the prompt I made really quickly
[11:03] with that um prompt gbt generator which
[11:06] you can get in my free school Community
[11:08] as well but as you can see um we just
[11:10] spun something up really really quick
[11:12] like I said this took me probably 5 to
[11:13] 10 minutes to set up um I used chbt to
[11:16] just create me some fake example data
[11:17] for the resorts the flights and the
[11:19] activities but the purpose of this video
[11:21] was to show you how to connect to open
[11:22] ai's new 03 Mini model that's their
[11:25] reasoning model more cost effective um
[11:27] you can do that through open router you
[11:28] can check on your usage up there and the
[11:30] new native node thanks to the new 1.77
[11:33] update makes that super super quick and
[11:35] easy but um yeah as you can see the tool
[11:37] calling works pretty well the reasoning
[11:39] is clearly pretty well pretty good as
[11:41] far as how it's able to plan out an
[11:43] itenerary based on given information and
[11:45] then it was able to format something
[11:46] pretty nice for us as well in an email
[11:48] so that's all I've got for you guys
[11:49] today as always really appreciate you
[11:51] making it to the end hope this one was
[11:52] helpful if it was please give it a like
[11:54] definitely helps me out a lot and I will
[11:56] see you guys in the next one
