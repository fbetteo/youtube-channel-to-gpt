[00:00] today I'm going to be walking through
[00:01] the simplest way to understand what an
[00:02] AI agent is the different components how
[00:04] they actually take action and do things
[00:06] and then I'm going to show you guys how
[00:07] to build a super simple one in minutes
[00:09] there's a lot of information out there
[00:10] on the internet about AI agents so I'm
[00:12] going to try to break it down for you
[00:14] guys as simple as possible using this
[00:15] little pretty diagram that I built and
[00:17] then we're going to get into nadn and
[00:19] I'm going to walk you through step by
[00:20] step how to get a email agent up and
[00:22] running really really easy I think you
[00:24] guys will be surprised by how quick you
[00:26] can spin one up so don't want to waste
[00:28] any time let's get straight into it as
[00:29] you can see right here we're looking at
[00:31] an AI agent sort of diagram with the
[00:33] different aspects right so in the blue
[00:34] here we're looking at the actual AI
[00:35] agent and you can just think of this as
[00:37] kind of an entity a human um an employee
[00:40] anything that you can pretty much talk
[00:42] to anything that has a brain and
[00:44] understands instructions just think of
[00:45] it like that right
[00:47] so when we are talking about an AI agent
[00:50] the two main components within one are
[00:51] the brain which is basically a large
[00:54] language model like chbt CLA 3.5
[00:56] something like that um and then some
[00:58] sort of aspect of memory so memory just
[01:01] basically means giving the agent context
[01:03] of what's been going on in a
[01:04] conversation that way it feels more
[01:05] human-like it's more conversational um
[01:08] rather than asking um a question and
[01:10] then getting an answer and then the
[01:12] Slate is wiped clean we pretty much have
[01:14] a running history of you know a window
[01:17] of the agents able to understand that so
[01:19] that its answers in the future make more
[01:20] sense or its actions and tools make more
[01:22] sense based on what we've talked about
[01:24] the past then we also have instructions
[01:27] so instructions within an AI agent
[01:29] basically just to fine this is your role
[01:31] this is what you should be doing this is
[01:32] how you act these are the tools you have
[01:35] this is how you take action it's just
[01:37] it's commonly known known as a system
[01:39] prompt within a AI agent or a system
[01:42] message um not to be confused by user
[01:44] messages which is more of the actual
[01:46] input going in so once we get into NN
[01:48] and we're looking at the agent I'll
[01:49] break this down it'll make a little more
[01:51] sense but the user message is the actual
[01:53] input this is how we're talking to the
[01:54] agent and the system message is the
[01:56] agent's instructions that don't change
[01:58] the input kind of changes every time
[01:59] based on every interaction finally of
[02:01] course it outputs something to us
[02:03] whether that's hey you know we were able
[02:05] to take action for you or whether that's
[02:07] explicitly using a tool like a vector
[02:09] database to pull information back and
[02:10] then returning you that information
[02:12] there's usually some aspect of output so
[02:15] as far as this section of this little
[02:17] diagram input AI agent with a large
[02:19] language model memory system prompt and
[02:22] then outputting something this is like
[02:24] just kind of like a chat gbt thing that
[02:26] you would do um on your laptop or
[02:28] whatever and you're talking to it that's
[02:29] chat PT but then when you start to
[02:32] introduce tools this is where the magic
[02:33] really happens because now the large
[02:36] language model has the ability to
[02:38] actually take action and let's say you
[02:40] just have one tool that's that's pretty
[02:41] cool but what we want to do is we
[02:43] ultimately start to add multiple tools
[02:45] and the agent uses its brain to
[02:47] understand sorry it uses its brain in
[02:50] combination with the instructions to
[02:53] understand what just came in what was
[02:55] the user message what tool do I need to
[02:56] do because what tool does what function
[02:59] and then how how do I actually go out
[03:00] there and take action so this is what it
[03:04] looks like right and now if we go over
[03:06] here this is pretty much the agent we're
[03:07] going to be building today it's it's
[03:09] similar so as you can see we have the
[03:11] input right here which is um on chat
[03:14] message received so we're just going to
[03:15] be chatting with our agent in the naden
[03:17] environment so that's the user message
[03:19] coming through to the agent the agent
[03:21] uses the user message um along with its
[03:23] system message to understand um what do
[03:27] I need to do here so here's its brain
[03:28] here's the chat model here's another
[03:30] aspect of the brain which is the memory
[03:31] and then finally our tool here is going
[03:33] to be sending an email so it understands
[03:35] to take the message um from the user
[03:37] craft an email and then it spits out to
[03:39] back to us it basically says the email
[03:41] was sent to blank so um I hope that all
[03:44] made sense I am going to hop into nadn
[03:46] now and we're going to walk through step
[03:48] byep how to build this really simple
[03:50] email agent okay we are now in nadn so
[03:52] first thing I'm going to do is hit add
[03:54] first step and we are going to type in
[03:56] AI agent we're going to grab this AI
[03:58] agent here and as you can see it put in
[04:00] this AI agent um entity and right now it
[04:03] automatically connected with a chat
[04:04] message receive trigger we can come in
[04:06] here and we can say hello this is how we
[04:08] talk to our agent this is the user
[04:09] message this is the input going into the
[04:11] agent however as you can see um there
[04:13] was an error because there's no chat
[04:15] model subnode which basically means the
[04:18] agent has no brain it doesn't know how
[04:19] to respond so under the agent we can see
[04:21] that we have chat model memory and Tool
[04:23] options we're going to add a chat model
[04:24] because we just got that error so let's
[04:26] give it the brain it pulls up a list of
[04:28] large language models on the right and
[04:30] we're going to click on open a chat
[04:31] model okay so now that we have the open
[04:33] AI chat model pulled up we have
[04:35] different options we have different
[04:36] models to choose from um but first what
[04:38] we need to do is connect a credential if
[04:40] we haven't done so already so you'll
[04:41] click into this arrow and you'll click
[04:43] create new credential and as you can see
[04:45] what we need to get from open AI is an
[04:46] API key that basically allows us to
[04:49] access their different models so you can
[04:51] click on docs and it will give you a
[04:53] good sort of walk through documentation
[04:54] of how to do this but basically you're
[04:56] going to go to open AI on the left hand
[04:58] side you'll see API keys and then you're
[05:00] going to come up here and click create
[05:02] new secret
[05:04] key um we're going to name it whatever
[05:06] we want and then it's going to give you
[05:07] a API key you'll copy this and then
[05:09] you're just going to paste it into nadn
[05:11] right
[05:16] here once you paste that in you'll hit
[05:18] save it will think about it it will go
[05:20] green to let you know that it was um
[05:22] connected successfully and then you're
[05:24] good to go you can click out of there
[05:25] and then you can explore all the
[05:26] different models that we have so right
[05:28] now I'm just going to leave this as GPT
[05:29] for mini one thing to note about your
[05:31] open AI you have to connect a few
[05:33] credits or some sort of source otherwise
[05:36] it's going to say insufficient funds so
[05:38] if you're getting that error just add
[05:39] some money into your account now if we
[05:41] were to click on chat we could come in
[05:42] here and just say hello and it's going
[05:44] to be able to respond to us because it
[05:45] has a brain as you can see it said hello
[05:48] how can I assist you today okay now that
[05:50] we see that the brain is working let's
[05:51] try to add some memory first what we're
[05:53] going to do is I'm going to tell the
[05:55] agent U my name is Nate so it's going to
[05:59] say like something like like Kate okay
[06:00] so nice to meet you how can I assist you
[06:03] now I'm going to
[06:04] say what's my name and it's probably not
[06:07] going to know my name I'm sorry but I
[06:09] don't know your name so as you can see
[06:10] it has no context of what we just talked
[06:12] about so now if we click on this Plus
[06:14] for memory and there's a couple
[06:15] different options here and we're going
[06:16] to use window buffer memory it's super
[06:18] easy especially if you're chatting
[06:20] within andn um very very easy and very
[06:22] quick to set up as you can see it's
[06:24] referencing our connected chat trigger
[06:25] node the session ID is coming from that
[06:27] chat trigger node and the context window
[06:29] link is five so it just means it's going
[06:31] to remember five messages um past
[06:34] interactions so if you're interested in
[06:37] the session ID it's basically going to
[06:38] be different for um the different ways
[06:41] of communication so right now um within
[06:44] the chat input we can see it's an action
[06:45] of send message actually I'll go to
[06:47] table view real quick the chat input
[06:49] that I just typed in was what's my name
[06:50] and then we have a session ID so
[06:52] basically what's going on here is that
[06:54] is what is being kept um in the context
[06:57] window length is based on the session ID
[06:58] that's dynamic because we have the Json
[07:00] variable as you can see right here
[07:03] anyways now that we have memory
[07:05] connected I'm going to say hi my name is
[07:09] Nate and it will say Hello nice to meet
[07:11] you Nate and then we're going to say
[07:13] what is my name and you can see that
[07:15] it's going to say your name is Nate okay
[07:16] awesome so we have memory we know that
[07:18] it's working we just tested that we have
[07:20] our input over here we have our actual
[07:21] agent with its brain we have the output
[07:24] coming right here and what we could do
[07:26] is um if we just want to make things
[07:28] look a little more VIs visually
[07:31] appealing you could pretty much just add
[07:33] the output right
[07:34] here um this isn't doing anything this
[07:37] is basically just for me to show you
[07:39] guys how it looks so input agent output
[07:42] right it says your name is Nate how can
[07:44] I help you today um and then brain so
[07:46] now we need to add the tool and then
[07:47] after we add the tool we can configure
[07:50] the system message so we're going to
[07:51] click on the plus and we're going to add
[07:53] a Gmail tool what we have to do here is
[07:56] connect our Google credentials um so if
[07:58] you need to do this and you haven't set
[08:00] it up yet you're going to click on docs
[08:02] from there um it'll walk you through how
[08:03] to do it pretty much but also I made a
[08:05] video um I'll tag it right up here how
[08:07] to connect your Google credentials
[08:09] within 5 minutes so you can watch that
[08:11] it will all make sense what we're going
[08:12] to do here is um leave everything as is
[08:15] for sending a message and we need to
[08:17] fill out the two the subject and the
[08:19] message to pass over to Google to
[08:20] actually send this off so the first
[08:23] thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
[08:24] change the email type to text because we
[08:26] want to do that rather than HTML and
[08:28] then for two we're going to come in here
[08:30] and make this an expression this
[08:31] basically just means um rather than
[08:33] putting in a fixed email that would
[08:36] every single time this tool ran it would
[08:37] go to that email we want this to be
[08:39] dynamic so we're going to click on
[08:41] expression so that way the two is going
[08:44] to change based on every interaction we
[08:46] have with the agent asking it to send a
[08:47] message for us so what we're going to do
[08:49] is type in two curly braces and then
[08:51] we're going to grab from AI this is a
[08:54] really really cool function because it
[08:56] lets us to find a key and potentially
[08:58] descriptions about the keys and the type
[09:00] of data it's looking for but really I
[09:02] found that you can pretty much do it
[09:03] just do a key so in this case we're
[09:06] going to do a key called email address
[09:09] or no actually let's do just be a little
[09:12] more specific email recipient so this is
[09:14] telling the
[09:15] AI that when it wants to fill out this
[09:18] parameter of the two field all it has to
[09:20] do is look through the query that's
[09:21] coming in from the user message the
[09:23] input it's going to look through that
[09:25] input and then it's going to decide who
[09:27] is the actual email recipient it's going
[09:29] going to pull that out of the query
[09:30] because it's going to use AI to do so
[09:32] and we're going to do the same thing for
[09:34] the rest of this node so subject we'll
[09:36] paste that in here make sure it's an
[09:37] expression and then the key is going to
[09:39] be subject and then we're going to do
[09:41] the same thing for message the
[09:43] expression is going to
[09:44] be email body so now we have those three
[09:49] Fields set up automatically AI is going
[09:51] to be looking through the query based on
[09:52] the user input and it's going to fill
[09:54] out the parameters and then finally I'm
[09:56] just going to click on ADD option click
[09:58] on append and attribute
[09:59] and then turn this off all this does is
[10:03] otherwise it's going to at the bottom of
[10:05] an email it's going to say something
[10:06] like this email was you know sent by
[10:09] nadn so finally we're just going to name
[10:11] this node send email just so that in the
[10:15] future if we wanted to start to add more
[10:17] tools we were able to Define to the
[10:19] agent what each tool is called and what
[10:21] each tool does we pretty much have
[10:23] everything the input the output the
[10:24] agent the brain the tool now we need to
[10:26] set up the system message so in this
[10:28] agent we we are going to click on ADD
[10:30] option and add system message by default
[10:32] it's going to say you're a helpful
[10:33] assistant which is fine it probably
[10:35] would work but we want to Define exactly
[10:37] what tools it has and when to use them
[10:40] um and so as you can see we have the
[10:41] system message down here like I said
[10:43] this tells the agent how to act this is
[10:45] the instructions but then the user
[10:47] message up here is going to be the input
[10:49] every time so right here as you can see
[10:51] it was what is my name so I'm going to
[10:52] be using this custom GPT that I've built
[10:54] to help me prompt my AI agents if you
[10:56] want to access this you can do so in my
[10:57] fre School Community the link for that
[10:58] will be down in the description and I
[11:00] know I'm going through this a little
[11:01] fast but if you're looking to dive
[11:02] deeper with nadn feel free to check out
[11:04] my paid Community Link for that will
[11:06] also be down in the description we've
[11:07] got a great community of people also
[11:08] trying to learn naden always asking
[11:10] questions always sharing resources a
[11:12] great classroom section as well as five
[11:14] life calls per week to make sure you can
[11:16] hop in there and get all of your
[11:17] questions answered so I'd love to see
[11:18] you guys in here anyways back to the GPT
[11:20] I pasted a screenshot of our workflow
[11:22] into the GPT and then I said an AI agent
[11:24] that uses the send email tool to send
[11:26] emails based on the user's query it is a
[11:28] helpful assist that is friendly so let's
[11:30] send this off to the GPT and we'll see
[11:32] what kind of system message we get back
[11:34] as you can see it's outputting it in
[11:35] markdown format which is really really
[11:37] nice because that helps the AI agent
[11:39] sort of establish um different sections
[11:41] of the prompt as you can see we've got
[11:42] overview context instructions tools
[11:45] examples standard operating procedure
[11:47] and then final notes so we're able to
[11:48] copy this prompt come back into nadn and
[11:51] then paste this as an expression um I
[11:54] just like to do Expressions so I can go
[11:55] full screen in here and it's fully
[11:57] marked on formatted which is really easy
[11:59] for for us for readability as well as
[12:01] for the AI agent to read through so
[12:04] we'll hit save and now let's test this
[12:05] out by asking it to actually send an
[12:07] email for us so we're going to say can
[12:09] you send an email to Nate herk
[12:13] 88@gmail.com
[12:16] asking him how his day
[12:20] was okay so we're going to see this in
[12:22] live time which I always think is cool
[12:24] um that is going to take place really
[12:25] quick but essentially what happened here
[12:27] was um we got the input
[12:29] the user message was can you send an
[12:31] email it's what I just asked right so
[12:33] then it used the brain and the system
[12:35] message to understand what it needed to
[12:36] do and then it hit the email tool if we
[12:39] click into here we can see that we got
[12:42] the correct email um the correct two the
[12:45] subject was made which was how how's
[12:46] your day and then the actual message was
[12:48] made which was hi Nate I hope this
[12:51] message finds you well I wanted to check
[12:52] in and see how your day has been going
[12:54] looking forward to hearing from you best
[12:56] placeholder your name so that's
[12:57] something I wanted to show you guys by
[12:59] default it's going to sign off like that
[13:01] because in the system message it doesn't
[13:03] know who to send an email from so if we
[13:06] came into the system message real quick
[13:08] and at the very bottom we just
[13:11] said
[13:13] um always sign off the emails
[13:18] from um
[13:21] Frank and now we save this and we pretty
[13:24] much just rerun this exact same
[13:26] query we'll watch this happen
[13:30] and there we go new email was sent and
[13:32] as you can see now it was signed off
[13:34] best Frank so let's hop into Gmail and
[13:36] actually see this email okay so here it
[13:38] is hi Nate I hope this message finds you
[13:40] well I just wanted to check and see how
[13:41] your day has been going and then you can
[13:42] see it signed off best regards Frank so
[13:44] something else important to understand
[13:45] here is the logs but let's pull it up
[13:48] within the AI agent just because it's a
[13:49] little bit bigger so we'll click in the
[13:50] agent we'll click on logs and now we can
[13:53] see basically what the agent did so we
[13:56] can see the steps that it took first
[13:58] thing that it did was it put our chat
[14:00] message into the window buffer memory
[14:02] that way we can store it later um if it
[14:04] needs to reference it from there it went
[14:06] to the open AI chat model which all it
[14:08] did was it looked through its prompt so
[14:10] it could understand what it needs to do
[14:11] based on the input coming in from us so
[14:14] it realized based on the prompt that it
[14:15] needed to use the tool called send email
[14:17] so we can see that it created this um
[14:20] these three parameters which was the
[14:22] email recipient the subject and the
[14:23] email body and if you remember those are
[14:26] the three that we set up as keys in this
[14:29] email tool right here um email recipient
[14:31] subject and email body so anyways after
[14:33] it created those parameters using AI it
[14:35] actually sent out the um email this is
[14:38] just a response from Gmail basically
[14:39] saying it went through here's the ID of
[14:41] that email it came back to the open ey
[14:43] chat model to check if there was
[14:44] anything else needed to do and also to
[14:47] craft a response to us and as you can
[14:49] see the response down here was I've sent
[14:50] the email to Nate herk asking how his
[14:52] day was if you need anything else feel
[14:54] free to ask and finally it hits the
[14:55] window buffer memory again in order to
[14:58] update the memory so that's really cool
[15:00] we had that working we're able to chat
[15:02] with it and it's able to send emails on
[15:03] our behalf but what if we don't want to
[15:05] type in an email address every time well
[15:07] what we can do is we can connect a
[15:09] contact database in this case I'm just
[15:11] going to be using this Google sheet
[15:12] database um just for Simplicity sake but
[15:15] this could always be something from your
[15:16] CRM or an air table or a vector database
[15:18] even so right now what we're going to be
[15:20] looking at is just this contact database
[15:22] we're going to be asking to send an
[15:23] email to Phil which is the email that we
[15:25] just use of course and then we've got
[15:26] some dummy data here to make sure that
[15:27] it's searching through and find the
[15:29] right one so all we're going to do in
[15:30] our agent is move this guy over add a
[15:32] new tool and we're going to grab a
[15:34] Google Sheets tool once again your
[15:36] credentials will have to be connected
[15:38] this should be easier now that you've
[15:39] already done it once with Gmail but um
[15:41] we don't really have to set anything up
[15:43] all we have to do is grab the right
[15:44] document which is contact database and
[15:46] then just choose the right sheet which
[15:48] in this case there was only one sheet
[15:50] and then we just want to name this
[15:51] something like contact database that way
[15:54] it knows how to look through it based on
[15:56] our prompt but you may have realized
[15:58] that in our prompts we didn't mention
[16:00] anything about a contact database so
[16:03] what we're going to do is we're going to
[16:05] go into chat gbt and we're going to
[16:07] utilize the memory aspect of a large
[16:09] language model and just say can you
[16:12] refine this prompt and add a tool
[16:16] called Contact
[16:20] database that the agent will use to
[16:26] retrieve contact data like
[16:30] email addresses okay so there we go
[16:33] we'll fire that off it'll pretty much
[16:35] keep all the same content that it
[16:37] already knows of you know from the
[16:39] previous prompt it's just going to add
[16:40] in the tool um about contact data so as
[16:43] you can see now we have the contact
[16:44] database tool retrieves contact data
[16:46] such as email addresses based on the
[16:47] user's query um it comes back with some
[16:49] more examples and stuff like that um so
[16:52] we're going to copy this back in to
[16:55] our prompts right here so we're going to
[16:57] save this and we're going to try to chat
[16:59] with the agent again um so remember this
[17:01] time we don't want to give an email
[17:03] address we want to say send an email to
[17:05] Phil and then we want to make sure that
[17:07] it goes to the contact database to get
[17:08] Phil's information and then it will use
[17:10] that to send the email so can you send
[17:14] an email to
[17:16] Phil um letting him
[17:20] know that I will not be at work
[17:24] today okay so it's going to hit the
[17:26] contact database going back to the brain
[17:28] going back to the Gmail node back to the
[17:30] brain we'll look at the logs in a sec
[17:33] but let's just see what happened so
[17:34] first of all the agent responded to us
[17:35] with I have sent the email to Phil
[17:37] letting him know that you'll not be at
[17:38] work today if there's anything else you
[17:39] need just let me know so click on the
[17:42] contact database we can see that it
[17:44] looked through all um how many rows
[17:47] there are it looked through those right
[17:50] um and then we can click into the Gmail
[17:52] node and see that it got the correct
[17:53] email the subject was not attending work
[17:56] today and the email body that it created
[17:58] was hi Phil I wanted to let you know
[18:00] that I will not be at work today please
[18:02] let me know if you need anything urgent
[18:03] in my absence thanks Nate but yeah
[18:06] that's basically going to be it for
[18:07] today's video I know that it was kind of
[18:09] a simple build but I just wanted to show
[18:10] you guys how quick and easy you can spin
[18:11] some of this stuff up especially if you
[18:13] haven't built one before it may seem a
[18:14] little daunting but especially with
[18:16] these Cool Tools and the from AI
[18:17] function it's really really easy to
[18:19] continuously add more tools as well as
[18:21] get them up and running really quick um
[18:23] so you know once you've done this
[18:26] there's other ways that you can have
[18:27] outputs and inputs sorry I should have
[18:29] gone the other way around inputs and
[18:30] outputs um right now obviously we're
[18:32] chatting with it within naden and we're
[18:34] able to get the output within NAD as
[18:36] well but you could connect this to you
[18:37] know your telegram you could connect it
[18:39] to your phone you could connect it to
[18:41] slack anything you want um and they can
[18:43] be triggers as well it doesn't have to
[18:45] be just hosted within the endend
[18:46] environment and then similarly you could
[18:48] get the outputs pushed somewhere else to
[18:50] you so this could be a complete backend
[18:52] application that you're able to hook up
[18:54] and you know talk to however you want I
[18:56] actually just made a video very similar
[18:57] to this about a email agent where I
[18:59] connected the input and the output to 11
[19:01] Labs so that I was having a phone
[19:02] conversation basically with this agent
[19:05] and in real time when I was asking it to
[19:06] send emails it was doing so and we kind
[19:08] of saw it take place and then it would
[19:09] respond to me after the email was sent
[19:11] and say I sent that off for you um so
[19:14] really cool stuff that you can do once
[19:15] you understand sort of the basics but as
[19:17] always if you guys enjoyed please leave
[19:18] a like definitely helps me out let me
[19:20] know in the comments what else you guys
[19:21] want to see and I really appreciate you
[19:23] guys making it see on this video so I'll
[19:24] see you guys in the next one
