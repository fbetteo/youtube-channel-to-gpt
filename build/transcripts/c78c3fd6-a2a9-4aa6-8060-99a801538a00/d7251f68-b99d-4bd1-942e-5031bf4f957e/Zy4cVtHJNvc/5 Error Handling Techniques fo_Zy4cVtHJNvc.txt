[00:00] Here are five error handling techniques
[00:01] that you need to know if you want to
[00:03] build AI automations. So what an error
[00:05] workflow is is it's a separate workflow
[00:07] that starts with an error trigger. And
[00:09] the error trigger can link up to any of
[00:11] your active workflows. And the idea is
[00:13] that whenever an active workflow errors,
[00:15] it will just notify this workflow and
[00:17] then you can set up the logic of what do
[00:19] I want to happen with an error. Number
[00:21] two is the ability to have our workflows
[00:23] retry on failure. What this means is
[00:25] that whenever our node faces an error,
[00:28] it's just going to try again. And you
[00:30] can control like wait this much time and
[00:32] then try again, try again five times and
[00:34] then just move on, whatever you want.
[00:36] And the way you do that is within any
[00:38] node, so like an AI agent node, you're
[00:40] going to go up to your settings and you
[00:42] can see right here, you can turn on the
[00:43] switch that says retry on fail. So I'll
[00:45] turn that on and you can see it now
[00:47] opens up these two other things that say
[00:49] max tries, how many times you want it to
[00:51] retry, and then how long do you want it
[00:52] to wait between tries. So you have a
[00:54] couple levers here to pull. But let's
[00:56] move on to number three, which is having
[00:58] a fallback LLM. So if I check this on,
[01:01] it basically allows us to connect a
[01:02] different model in case the main one
[01:04] fails. So let's say open router is our
[01:06] favorite and we're using GPT 4.1 Mini.
[01:08] Open router's down or open AI is down.
[01:11] What we can do is we can connect another
[01:12] model over here and we can just go with
[01:14] Google Gemini. And now we have this
[01:16] model in place. So now if I save this
[01:18] workflow and I say hi, it's going to try
[01:21] that first model. It fails. And then
[01:23] what happens is it just goes to the
[01:24] fallback model. And now we make sure
[01:26] that we're still at least getting some
[01:28] sort of answer. If you want to watch the
[01:29] full breakdown, click on that play
