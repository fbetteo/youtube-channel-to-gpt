[00:00] This is how I build multi-agent systems
[00:01] in NADN with no code. So a multi- aent
[00:03] system is one where we have multiple
[00:05] autonomous AI agents working together in
[00:07] order to get the job done and they're
[00:09] able to talk to each other and they're
[00:10] able to use the tools that they have
[00:11] access to. What we're going to be
[00:12] talking about today is a type of
[00:13] multi-agent system called the
[00:15] orchestrator architecture. And basically
[00:17] what that means that we have one agent
[00:18] up here. I call it the parent agent and
[00:20] then I call these child agents. But we
[00:22] have an orchestrator agent that's able
[00:24] to call on different sub aents. And the
[00:26] best way to think about it is this
[00:27] agent's only goal is to understand the
[00:30] intent of the user whether that's
[00:31] through telegram or through email
[00:33] whatever it is understanding that intent
[00:34] and then understanding okay I have
[00:36] access to these four agents and here is
[00:38] what each one is good at which one or
[00:41] which ones do I need to call in order to
[00:43] actually achieve the end goal. So, in
[00:44] this case, if I'm saying to the agent,
[00:46] can you please write me a quick blog
[00:48] post about dogs and send that to Dexter
[00:51] Morgan, and can you also create a dinner
[00:53] event for tonight at 6 p.m. with Michael
[00:55] Scott? And thank you. Cool. So, this is
[00:58] a pretty loaded task, right? And can you
[01:00] imagine if this one agent had access to
[01:02] all of these like 15 or however many
[01:05] tools and it had to do all of that
[01:06] itself, it would be pretty overwhelmed
[01:08] and it wouldn't be able to do it very
[01:10] accurately. So, what you can see here is
[01:12] it is able to just understand, okay, I
[01:13] have these four agents. They each have a
[01:15] different role. Which ones do I need to
[01:16] call? And you can see what it's doing is
[01:18] it called the contact agent to get the
[01:19] contact information. Right now, it's
[01:21] calling the content creator agent. And
[01:22] now that that's finished up, it's
[01:23] probably going to call the calendar
[01:24] agent to make that event. And then it's
[01:26] going to call the email agent in order
[01:27] to actually send that blog that we had
[01:29] the content creator agent make. And then
[01:31] you can see it also called this little
[01:32] tool down here called think. But we just
[01:34] got a response back from the
[01:35] orchestrator agent. So, let's see what
[01:37] it said. All right. So, it said the blog
[01:38] post about dogs has been sent to Dexter
[01:39] Morgan. a dinner event for tonight at 6
[01:41] p.m. with Michael Scott has been
[01:42] created. And if you need anything else,
[01:44] let me know. And just to verify that
[01:45] that actually went through, you can see
[01:46] we have a new event for dinner at 6 p.m.
[01:48] with Michael Scott. And then in our
[01:49] email in our scent, we can see that we
[01:51] have a full blog post sent to Dexter
[01:53] Morgan. If you want to learn more like
