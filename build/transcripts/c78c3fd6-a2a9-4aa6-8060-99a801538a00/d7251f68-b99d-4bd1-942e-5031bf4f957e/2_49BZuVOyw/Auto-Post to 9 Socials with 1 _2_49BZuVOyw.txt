[00:00] I just built this workflow so I can
[00:01] automatically post on nine different
[00:02] social channels. So the first thing we
[00:04] need to do before we can actually post
[00:05] is we need to create a Blot API key and
[00:08] we need to sign into our social profiles
[00:10] that we actually want to post to. And
[00:11] then once I'm in Blot, I'm going to go
[00:13] to my settings in the bottom left and
[00:14] all we have to do is start to add our
[00:16] accounts. So let's say for the first
[00:18] example, we're just going to log in with
[00:20] Tik Tok and Instagram. All you do is
[00:21] click on the button, log in. Super easy.
[00:23] You can see I've connected other
[00:24] accounts down here. And then because you
[00:26] already signed into like your Instagram
[00:27] and Tik Tok account on Botato, all you
[00:29] have to do in this node is choose the
[00:31] right account from the list. So it
[00:32] really should be the only one there. But
[00:33] all you have to do now is choose the
[00:35] right account. And then you can see when
[00:36] you're posting on Tik Tok or Instagram,
[00:38] they're going to have different
[00:39] settings. So you have a privacy level.
[00:41] You can like disable comments. Is it AI
[00:43] generated? And all of these nodes are
[00:45] going to have different little levers
[00:47] and different filters to play with. But
[00:49] it's so much easier as a community node
[00:51] because in the old way we had to do like
[00:53] an HTTP request for all of them and they
[00:55] all had different like JSON body
[00:56] parameters to send over. So this is a
[00:59] lot easier now. So what this is going to
[01:01] do is pull in our video as well as like
[01:03] our title and our caption from our
[01:05] Google sheet. It's going to upload that
[01:07] video to Blot and then Blot is going to
[01:09] go ahead and create those posts on
[01:11] Instagram and Tik Tok as you can see.
[01:13] And then it goes back into our Google
[01:15] sheet that we're originally pulling from
[01:16] and it says, "Okay, this first row has
[01:18] now been posted." And there you go. Now
[01:20] you can see we have our glass apple ASMR
[01:22] on both Instagram and Tik Tok. And if I
[01:24] click on one of them, it'll take us
[01:26] right to that actual post. So we can see
[01:27] that it is indeed there. If you want to
[01:29] watch the full breakdown, click on that
[01:31] play button right here, and I'll see you
[01:32] guys over
