[00:00] Here's how I built Jarvis from Iron Man
[00:01] using absolutely no code. Oh, great.
[00:03] What do you want? Hey, Jarvis. Great to
[00:05] see you, too. Likewise, sir. Though I
[00:08] can't technically see. What is it you
[00:10] require? Yeah. Could you make a calendar
[00:12] event for me today at noon with Michael
[00:14] Scott? Ah, a meeting with Michael Scott.
[00:17] I can only hope it's as productive as
[00:18] his management style. Scheduling it now,
[00:22] sir. The meeting with Michael Scott has
[00:25] been scheduled for today at noon. I've
[00:27] sent you the details. Anything else I
[00:29] can do for you or are you off to
[00:31] brainstorm new and innovative ways to
[00:32] avoid actual work?
[00:35] Yeah, very funny. Jarvis, could you just
[00:36] send him an email to confirm if that
[00:38] works? Sending an email to confirm. How
[00:41] delightfully redundant. I'll do it, but
[00:43] I suspect Mr. Scott's response will be
[00:46] unpredictable. The email has been
[00:48] dispatched, sir. I've taken the liberty
[00:49] of adding a few exclamation points to
[00:51] match his usual level of enthusiasm.
