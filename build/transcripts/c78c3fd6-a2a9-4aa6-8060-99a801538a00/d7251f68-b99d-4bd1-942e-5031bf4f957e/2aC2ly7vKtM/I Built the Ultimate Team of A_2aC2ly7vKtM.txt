[00:00] I just built the ultimate personal
[00:01] assistant in nadn using absolutely no
[00:03] code as you can see the ultimate
[00:04] assistant has access to these four
[00:06] agents that we built out within nadn the
[00:08] first one is an email agent it looks
[00:09] like this next agent is a calendar agent
[00:11] it looks like this then we have a
[00:12] content creator agent that can search
[00:13] the web and then it creates blog posts
[00:15] for us you please set up a team sync
[00:16] tonight for 6 p.m. with Nate herkelman
[00:19] and then send him an email to confirm if
[00:20] that time works okay so right now
[00:22] telegram just sent over that audio file
[00:24] it's getting transcribed now the
[00:25] ultimate assistant has to decide what to
[00:26] do so first of all hit the contact agent
[00:28] to get Nate Herman's email address now
[00:31] it's hitting calendar and email agent
[00:32] simultaneously to create that event as
[00:34] you can see it just popped up right here
[00:36] and send that email so we just got our
[00:38] response back from telegram the team
[00:39] sync with Nate herkelman has been
[00:40] scheduled for tonight at 6 p.m. you can
[00:42] manage the event here then hopping into
[00:44] our sent emails we can see hey Nate I
[00:45] hope this message finds you well could
[00:47] you confirm if 6 p.m. works for our
[00:48] upcoming team sync let me know if you
