[00:00] On the left we have chatbt. On the right
[00:02] we have my n&N assistant. And what I'm
[00:03] going to do is send off this message
[00:05] that's asking my NN assistant to send an
[00:07] email to Dexter Morgan asking for an
[00:09] update on project panda. I'm going to
[00:10] allow my chatbt to talk to naden. And
[00:12] now you can see it's going to grab that
[00:14] message search through our contact
[00:15] database and then it's going to come
[00:17] over here and write that email using our
[00:18] email agent. And then when it responds
[00:20] to the web hook using this node right
[00:22] here, we're going to get that response
[00:23] in chat gbt on the lefth hand side. So
[00:26] there you go. We just got the response.
[00:27] The email has been sent to Dexter Morgan
[00:29] asking if he has an update on Project
[00:30] Panda. Is there anything else you'd like
[00:32] to do? And as you can see over here, we
[00:34] have that email that was successfully
[00:35] sent to dextermiami.com.
[00:38] So, what I'm going to be showing you
[00:39] guys is how you can connect your chatbt
[00:41] to an end web hook. And it doesn't have
[00:42] to be an ultimate assistant. It could be
[00:44] a workflow to update something in your
[00:45] CRM or to parse an invoice or to do
[00:47] whatever you want because you have the
[00:49] functionality in edit end to build
[00:50] custom workflows and then just have them
[00:52] be triggered by chatgbt which you
[00:54] probably are sitting there using every
[00:55] day. It's not going to be too difficult
[00:57] at all. So, let's get into it. Okay. So,
[00:58] how the system works is we're going to
[01:00] build a custom GPT and in that GPT,
[01:02] we're going to give it an action, which
[01:03] is the ability to send data to our NIDAN
[01:06] web hook right here. So, the demo that I
[01:07] just showed was a pretty fun example,
[01:09] but we're going to go over an example of
[01:10] a very practical one where you can drop
[01:12] in a invoice into your custom GPT and
[01:15] then it will send you that data to
[01:16] upload to a database. And what's going
[01:18] to be cool about this is chatgbt is the
[01:20] one on the front end that is going to
[01:22] use its vision to analyze the invoice
[01:24] and extract the text. So we don't have
[01:26] to worry about nadn setting up any sort
[01:28] of OCR or document understanding tool
[01:30] because chatgbt takes care of that. All
[01:32] right, so let's get started. What we're
[01:34] going to do is go to this custom GBT
[01:36] which is one by chat GBT. It's called
[01:38] actions GBT and it helps us create that
[01:40] JSON schema that we need to give to our
[01:41] custom GBT so that it can send data to
[01:44] the web hook. So I'm going to have this
[01:45] GBT linked in the description. Click on
[01:47] that and then follow along what I'm
[01:48] about to do here. Okay, so I said help
[01:50] me create an open API 3.1.0 schema in
[01:53] JSON so that I can give it to a custom
[01:55] GPT and it will send data to my web hook
[01:57] and then we're going to go into NADN and
[01:59] we're going to open up this web hook and
[02:01] grab this test URL real quick. Go back
[02:04] into the actions GPT and paste that in
[02:05] there. And then what I want to do is
[02:07] tell it the parameters that it's going
[02:08] to send over to this web hook. So in
[02:11] that first example you saw I talked to
[02:12] my ultimate assistant. I just told it
[02:14] send over one field in the body called
[02:16] request. But in this one, we want the
[02:18] GPT to look at the invoice and pull out,
[02:20] you know, the date, the invoice number,
[02:22] the amount, all this kind of stuff. So,
[02:24] I said here are the fields to send over
[02:25] in the body request. And I gave it all
[02:27] of the fields I want. And then I gave it
[02:28] the data types, which all of these I
[02:30] just put as strings. You could always
[02:31] come back and change that, but for now,
[02:33] we're just going to go ahead and send
[02:34] this off. So, as you can see, it's
[02:35] generating this JSON schema for us
[02:37] that's going to have our web hook URL,
[02:39] our path. It's going to have the things
[02:40] that we need to send over to Nitn. And
[02:43] then once we grab that data and end it
[02:44] in, all we have to do is map it to a
[02:46] Google sheet. So I'm going to go ahead
[02:48] and copy this schema right here. I'm
[02:49] going to open up my chatgpt and go to
[02:51] custom GPTs. And then in the top right,
[02:53] I'm going to click create. Okay. So this
[02:55] is going to have you configure the name,
[02:56] the description, and the instructions
[02:58] for your GPT. You can go ahead and take
[03:00] a look at what I put in here and copy
[03:02] the instructions if you'd like. But
[03:03] where the magic really happens is when
[03:04] we give this agent access to actions. So
[03:07] I'm going to scroll down to the bottom.
[03:08] I'm going to check on this box that says
[03:10] code interpreter and data analysis. And
[03:12] I'm going to click on create new action.
[03:14] And then right here in the schema, this
[03:15] is where we paste in that open API
[03:17] schema we just generated with that
[03:18] custom GPT. And once I paste this in,
[03:20] you're going to see down here with
[03:22] available actions. It creates basically
[03:24] a new tool called send invoice data. We
[03:26] have our method as post and then we have
[03:28] the web hook path. So what I'm going to
[03:29] do real quick is we need to go to end
[03:31] and we need to set our web hook as a
[03:33] post method. So here's the web hook. I'm
[03:35] going to change the HTTP method to post
[03:37] and then I'm going to hit listen for
[03:38] test event. So right now this web hook
[03:40] is listening. We'll go back to the GPT
[03:42] and I'll hit test. And what this is
[03:43] going to do is it's basically going to
[03:45] try to talk to our end cloud. I'll hit
[03:48] confirm. And once we'll see that it's
[03:50] going to talk to it. It has been able to
[03:52] communicate. And now if I go back to my
[03:54] workflow, you can see that we accepted
[03:55] some data. And if I scroll all the way
[03:57] down towards the bottom, you can see the
[03:58] body parameters that got sent over were
[04:00] date, invoice number, sold by, bill to,
[04:03] products, and pricing, and total. So
[04:06] this is exactly what it's going to
[04:07] extract when we actually drop in an
[04:09] invoice. So obviously this is just
[04:11] sample madeup data. So we have our web
[04:13] hook here and what I'm going to do is go
[04:14] back into our custom GBT and we're
[04:16] basically configured and I'm going to
[04:17] hit create and I'm going to say only me
[04:20] and then save it. And now that we just
[04:21] created this GPT let's try to drop in an
[04:23] invoice and test it out. Okay, so we
[04:25] have an example invoice right here
[04:26] that's a PDF and I'm going to send this
[04:28] off and it's going to say please process
[04:29] this invoice. You can see the GPT is
[04:32] trying to talk to our Nitn. So I'm going
[04:33] to hit confirm and then it's going to be
[04:35] able to send that data.
[04:38] Well, we have to make sure it's
[04:39] listening for us. So, I'm going to go
[04:40] back into the workflow. I'm going to hit
[04:41] execute workflow. Now, it's listening.
[04:43] And we'll try this again. Okay. So, I
[04:44] said try again. I'm going to hit
[04:46] confirm. And this time, it should be
[04:47] able to read that invoice and send data
[04:50] over. So, you can see we just captured
[04:51] data in NN. I'm going to go to table
[04:53] view just so we can look at it better.
[04:54] And we can see we have a date, an
[04:56] invoice number. We have sold by with an
[04:58] address. We have bill to with an
[05:00] address. And then we have our products
[05:01] and pricing and our total. And here's
[05:03] the actual example invoice we dropped
[05:04] in. We can see the invoice number and
[05:06] the date. Um those line up perfectly. We
[05:09] can see the sold by and the bill to
[05:10] which should be local store importing
[05:12] company. Local store importing company.
[05:14] We have the right email address and
[05:16] address as well. We have two items.
[05:17] Conveyor belt for 400, pole for 85. And
[05:21] then in here we have pole for 85 and
[05:23] conveyor belt for 400. And the total is
[05:26] 702 which you can see matches up over
[05:28] here. So like I said, we drop an invoice
[05:29] into our custom GPT. It uses its vision
[05:32] to analyze it and then it sends over the
[05:34] parameters to us. And now all we have to
[05:35] do is put that into a Google sheet. So I
[05:37] have this template real quick which has
[05:39] those exact parameters. I'm going to go
[05:41] into here. I'm going to connect a Google
[05:43] sheet and we're going to do append row
[05:45] and sheet. Now all I have to do is link
[05:46] up that sheet that we were talking about
[05:48] called invoice database. I'll link it to
[05:50] sheet one. And then this is going to pop
[05:52] up with all of those columns that we
[05:53] have set up in Google Sheets. So I would
[05:55] just close out of headers and go to the
[05:56] body. We have date, we have invoice
[05:59] number, we have sold by, we have bill
[06:01] to, we have products and pricing, and
[06:03] then we have our total. So now all I'm
[06:05] going to do is hit save. I'm going to
[06:07] make this thing listen to us once again.
[06:09] Then I'm going to go ahead back into our
[06:10] chatbt. I'm going to drop in the invoice
[06:12] once again and say process this, send it
[06:16] off, and we should be able to talk to
[06:18] the connector. I'll hit confirm. And now
[06:20] we should see that once this is done,
[06:22] we'll go ahead and come into here and we
[06:24] should see that it's going to write that
[06:25] data to this sheet. There we go. And so
[06:28] two things I want to point out. The
[06:29] first one is how do you want your
[06:31] workflow in NN to respond to your custom
[06:33] GPT. In that first demo, we basically
[06:36] used the respond to web hook node
[06:37] because sometimes we had to wait for
[06:38] data to come back. But in this case, we
[06:40] were just responding immediately. And
[06:42] you can change that setting in the web
[06:43] hook. So right here you have respond.
[06:45] This one was set to immediately or you
[06:47] can use the respond to web hook node
[06:49] which will send back whatever comes at
[06:51] the end of the workflow back to the
[06:53] initial thing that triggered it. So
[06:55] there's that. And then the other thing
[06:56] is right now we're testing the web hook.
[06:58] So we have to hit execute workflow. If
[07:00] we wanted to switch this to active, we
[07:03] would have to actually use the
[07:04] production URL in here. So the only
[07:06] difference is that after cloud/web hook,
[07:09] the test one says test and the
[07:11] production one doesn't say test. So,
[07:14] what you could do is go back into your
[07:15] custom GBT. You could open it up and say
[07:17] edit GPT. And then in here, you would
[07:19] just scroll down to your action, which
[07:21] is the one that we configured. And all
[07:23] you'd have to do is right here for the
[07:24] path, you would just basically get rid
[07:26] of the dash test and everything else
[07:29] should already be configured. Then you'd
[07:30] hit update up here and your GPT would be
[07:32] saved and it would be able to talk to
[07:34] your active workflow. And just to show
[07:36] you guys how that respond to web hook
[07:37] node thing works, I'm asking the GPT to
[07:39] get Mark Johnson's contact information.
[07:41] It's going to send that query off to our
[07:43] ultimate assistant and it has to wait
[07:45] over here until it actually gets Mark
[07:47] Johnson's contact information. So the
[07:49] agent's about to send it back to the web
[07:50] hook and now our custom GPT can respond
[07:53] to us. And just so you guys see that
[07:54] that worked, we have Mark 2343 and 333
[07:57] 444, which is exactly what we see for
[08:00] Mark in our Air Table base. So if you
