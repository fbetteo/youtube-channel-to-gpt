[00:00] here's how to build a calendar agent in
[00:01] nadn with no code in under a minute so
[00:03] once you're in nadn you're going to hit
[00:04] tab type in AI agent and then you'll
[00:06] grab your agent now all we have to do is
[00:08] hook up the brain which is a chat model
[00:09] so click on this plus I'm going to grab
[00:11] in GPT 40 mini and then we have to add a
[00:13] tool so I'm going to click on the plus
[00:14] under tool type in calendar and grab a
[00:16] Google Calendar tool now in here all we
[00:18] have to do is really simple first of all
[00:19] just choose the calendar that we're
[00:20] going to be pulling from and then for
[00:21] start date and end date I can just click
[00:23] on this button and all this is doing is
[00:24] it's letting the model decide how to
[00:26] fill in this parameter and then what I
[00:27] want to do is be able to add a title to
[00:29] the event so I'm going to come in the
[00:30] extra fields and I'm going to add a
[00:31] summary and then once again click on
[00:33] this button to let the model Define it
[00:35] and then the last step is just to rename
[00:36] the tool so the agent knows what it's
[00:37] doing and I'm just going to say create
[00:39] event and then the last thing we want to
[00:41] do is within the actual agent we just
[00:42] want to tell it what time it is
[00:43] currently so that we can say create an
[00:45] event for today so I'm going to get rid
[00:46] of this in the system prompt and say
[00:48] here is the current date slash time and
[00:52] then I'm going to give it the current
[00:53] date and time by using two curly braces
[00:54] and typing in dollar sign now and now it
[00:56] has the current date and time so now
[00:58] we're actually done already I'm going to
[00:59] go to my calendar so you guys can see
[01:00] real quick there's nothing on the rest
[01:02] of the day we're going to ask it to make
[01:03] an event for 5:00 p.m. so I'm saying
[01:05] create an event for 5:00 p.m. for dinner
[01:06] tonight it will be 2 and 1/2 hours long
[01:08] so once we send this off we'll see the
[01:09] agent think about it and then use its
[01:11] tool and it already did that really
[01:12] quick and it filled in those parameters
[01:14] you can see that the dinner has been
[01:15] successfully scheduled it will last for
[01:16] 2 hours ending at 7:30 so back in the
[01:19] calendar here it is from 5:00 to 7:30 we
[01:20] have an event called dinner and we go
[01:22] back into ended end we can click into
[01:23] this tool and we can see what it did so
[01:25] it was able to fill out the start time
[01:26] end time and create a summary for the
[01:28] event if you're interested in learning
