[00:00] I just built a fully humanin thee Loop
[00:01] calendar agent in nadn using no code so
[00:03] what I'm going to say is create an event
[00:04] for tonight with Michael Scott for
[00:06] dinner at 5:00 p.m. but as you can see
[00:07] we have a scheduling conflict so I set
[00:09] that off to the agent it's going to look
[00:10] at our calendar events as well as get
[00:12] Michael Scott's contact information and
[00:14] then it's going to send us a message to
[00:15] approve so here's what we got back
[00:16] you've requested to create an event for
[00:17] dinner tonight at 5:00 p.m. with Michael
[00:19] Scott although Michael has two email
[00:21] addresses so which one do you want us to
[00:22] send it to additionally I found an
[00:24] existing event scheduled for today from
[00:25] 4:17 to 517 which is a scheduling
[00:28] conflict would you like us to proceed
[00:30] with creating the event for 5:00 p.m. or
[00:31] do you want to reschedule delete what do
[00:32] you want to do so now I'm giving
[00:34] feedback I said use his business email
[00:35] and keep the time and as soon as we send
[00:37] this off it goes back to the workflow to
[00:39] go to the correction agent to make a
[00:40] revision to our request now we can see
[00:42] in telegram we have a new intent create
[00:43] an event for dinner tonight at 5:00 p.m.
[00:45] with Michael Scott using his business
[00:46] email address as you can see we have the
[00:48] details of the event right here with the
[00:50] correct address and then it asks us to
[00:52] confirm if this is correct so we can go
[00:53] in here and say correct send that off
[00:55] and then we'll see in the workflow it's
[00:56] going up to the calendar agent and now
[00:58] it's creating that event for us so we
[00:59] ref fully in the loop making sure
[01:01] everything was correct so now you can
[01:02] see that the event has been created with
[01:04] Michael's business email even though
[01:05] there's a scheduling conflict it's okay
[01:07] because we approved it ourselves if you
[01:09] want to learn more about how I built
[01:10] this or even download this workflow for
