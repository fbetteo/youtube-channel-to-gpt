[00:00] Today I'm going to be showing you guys
[00:01] this AI system that I built that I
[00:02] actually use every single day. It
[00:04] essentially acts as my YouTube
[00:05] strategist and it's been helping me grow
[00:07] my channel and consistently bring in
[00:08] over $6,000 a month from YouTube. As
[00:11] always, I'm giving you all the resources
[00:12] that you need to set the system up
[00:14] completely for free. So, by the end of
[00:15] this video, you'll have this exact
[00:16] system running for you as a YouTube
[00:18] strategist. So, let's go ahead and do a
[00:19] live demo. I'm going to run the system.
[00:21] We'll take a look at the results and
[00:22] then we'll break down every single node
[00:23] so that you guys can see how I built
[00:25] this thing. So, we basically have five
[00:26] different phases here. So, let's start
[00:28] with phase one, which is niche outliers.
[00:30] The idea here is that you pop up this
[00:31] form submission, and you're prompted to
[00:33] enter in three YouTube channels that are
[00:34] in your niche. So, right here, you can
[00:36] see I put in Nick Surve, RoboNuggets,
[00:38] and Simon Scrapes. Keep killing it,
[00:39] guys. I'm going to hit submit, and then
[00:41] we're going to watch this first phase
[00:42] kick off. And right now, what it's going
[00:44] to do is it's going to take all three of
[00:45] those channels. It's going to go look at
[00:47] their outliers, so their best performing
[00:49] videos over the past 6 months. It's
[00:50] going to grab those top 10 and then
[00:52] analyze their titles and their
[00:54] thumbnails. And then we're going to get
[00:55] all of that data for us in a Google
[00:57] sheet. So, as you can see right now,
[00:58] it's working on scraping videos from
[00:59] Nick's channel. And then it's going to
[01:00] loop through and do RoboNuggets, then
[01:02] Simon. So, I'll check back in with you
[01:03] guys when this first phase is complete.
[01:05] All right, we're on that third batch
[01:07] right now of the loop. And you can see
[01:08] it's analyzing these 10 titles. Then
[01:10] it's going to go down and analyze the
[01:11] thumbnails and then we'll have our
[01:13] finished results. All right, there we
[01:14] go. Just finished up and we're writing
[01:16] back to Google Sheets. So, I'm going to
[01:17] hop over to that tab and we'll take a
[01:18] look. Okay, here we are on the first tab
[01:20] of this Google sheet, which is the niche
[01:22] outliers. So, as you can see, the first
[01:23] channel we looked at was Nick Surv. And
[01:25] we can see that we have his 10 best
[01:27] performing videos from the past 6
[01:28] months. And the data that we get about
[01:30] each of these videos is the title, the
[01:32] URL, the thumbnail, the views, the
[01:34] likes, and then here's where our AI
[01:35] analysis comes into play. So, one of the
[01:37] most important things about YouTube is
[01:38] the title and the thumbnail, which is
[01:40] the packaging. So, what we have that
[01:42] first AI agent do is look at the title
[01:43] and pull out the power words that were
[01:45] used in the title. Once we break down
[01:47] the build, I'll show you guys how I
[01:48] prompted it. But basically, you can see
[01:49] it's pulling out certain words that are
[01:50] grabbing attention or making some sort
[01:52] of promise. Like right here, we have
[01:54] full course 6 hours, build and sell AI
[01:56] automations. We have start and sell AI
[01:58] service 10 hours, boring AI automations
[02:01] 1.5K each, 2025, stuff like that. So,
[02:04] the idea of this first sheet is that you
[02:05] can go ahead and look at other channels
[02:07] in your niche that are doing well. You
[02:08] can look at their best performing videos
[02:10] and you can see different things in
[02:11] their titles, different patterns that
[02:13] are probably leading to their videos
[02:14] performing well. And then you can start
[02:15] to think, how can I make titles with my
[02:17] niche and my content that work into
[02:19] these patterns? So then of course, here
[02:20] are all of RoboNuggets top performing
[02:22] videos from the past six months. And
[02:23] then the same thing down here with
[02:25] Simon. And then we move on to the second
[02:26] part of packaging, which is thumbnail
[02:28] analysis. For example, this first one,
[02:30] it grabs attention and encourages clicks
[02:32] because the bold text says full a
[02:34] automation course. It's large, it's high
[02:36] contrast, and it immediately shows the
[02:37] viewers the value that they'll get out
[02:38] of the video. And then we can go ahead
[02:40] and click into this link right here, and
[02:41] it will pull up the actual thumbnail
[02:43] that was used for the video. But the
[02:44] idea here is once again analyze the
[02:46] packaging that's working well for your
[02:48] niche and then see how you can customize
[02:50] it to fit into your videos. All right,
[02:52] so that's phase one of this workflow,
[02:54] which was basically a form submission.
[02:55] So you set that off whenever you want.
[02:57] Now, the rest of these phases are
[02:58] automations that go off on a schedule
[03:00] trigger. So first, let's go look at
[03:01] phase two, which is one automation in
[03:03] itself. And this one runs every single
[03:05] week on Sunday. So I'm going to go ahead
[03:07] and execute this workflow down here. And
[03:08] this is basically looking at my broad
[03:10] niche. So my targeted niche is pretty
[03:12] clearly NN, but my broader niche is
[03:14] maybe a automation or artificial
[03:16] intelligence. So that's what I put right
[03:18] here in the set node is artificial
[03:20] intelligence. So now we have another
[03:22] ampify actor running scraping YouTube.
[03:24] It basically searched for the word
[03:26] artificial intelligence and it's going
[03:27] to do the same thing. Analyze the titles
[03:29] and analyze the thumbnails. And then
[03:31] it's going to put that into a Google
[03:32] sheet for us to take a look at. So
[03:33] that's finishing up right now. Let me
[03:35] click back into the Google sheet. We'll
[03:36] go to the second tab which is broad
[03:38] niche daily. And here you can see we
[03:39] just got our broad niche insights. So on
[03:42] this tab, we're getting basically the
[03:43] same columns, but these are five videos
[03:45] that are in our broader niche and it's
[03:47] going to run every single week. And the
[03:48] idea here is that you don't want to get
[03:50] caught in the bubble of your niche and
[03:51] only looking and analyzing other people
[03:53] in your niche because packaging that
[03:55] works on YouTube, even if it's really
[03:56] general, can be basically narrowed down
[03:58] to your niche and applied to your
[04:00] videos. So here we can see some power
[04:02] words like AI in the future workforce
[04:04] impact jobs artificial intelligence lose
[04:06] it Sam Alman AGI GBT5 stuff like that
[04:09] and it may not seem super impactful when
[04:11] we just look at five but as this builds
[04:13] up you're going to continue to get a
[04:15] pattern bank of outliers and analyze why
[04:17] did these videos perform so well why are
[04:19] they outliers and then of course we get
[04:20] the analysis over here so this one is
[04:22] two people deep in conversation and if I
[04:24] click into it we can see that it is Sam
[04:26] Alman and someone else deep in
[04:27] conversation and so even though this may
[04:29] not really work for my specific speific
[04:30] niche with like an N-N workflow and me
[04:32] sitting down, it can still just kind of
[04:34] help you put yourself in the shoes of a
[04:36] consumer. Okay, so now we'll move on to
[04:37] phase 3, four, and five, which are all
[04:39] linked up together in one workflow. All
[04:41] three of these phases will run every
[04:43] single day at 6:00 a.m. So, let me just
[04:44] go ahead and kick it off. So, what
[04:46] happens here is now we're looking more
[04:47] targeted in our niche for insights. So,
[04:50] right here, I set my niche as NAN. It's
[04:52] going to go ahead once again, scrape
[04:53] those YouTube videos from the past week
[04:55] that are performing really well in our
[04:56] niche, analyze the titles, and analyze
[04:58] the thumbnails. And then we get that
[05:00] data back and then we move into phase
[05:02] four and five which are a little bit
[05:03] more tailored towards us specifically.
[05:05] So the first thing that it's going to do
[05:06] is it's going to actually scrape our own
[05:08] comments. So right here I set my channel
[05:10] URL. You can see I put in
[05:11] youtube.com/nateherk.
[05:13] And what we have here is another appy
[05:15] actor that is grabbing our five most
[05:17] recent uploads. And now that it has
[05:19] those videos, it's passing in those URLs
[05:21] to a different actor that's going to go
[05:22] grab the comments from each of those
[05:24] YouTube videos. So the idea here is
[05:26] every single day, this comment analyzer
[05:28] agent is going to look at all the most
[05:29] recent comments on our channel. It's
[05:31] going to analyze them and it's going to
[05:32] pull out patterns and it's going to put
[05:33] them into three different buckets. So
[05:35] things that we're doing good, things
[05:36] that we're doing bad, and things that
[05:38] the audience wants more of. So once it's
[05:40] done analyzing that, it's going to write
[05:41] it to Sheets and we move on to phase
[05:42] five, which is ideation. So ideation
[05:45] basically takes the output from this
[05:47] phase over here and this phase right
[05:49] here and it basically is going to give
[05:50] us some more ideas about how we can
[05:52] package future videos. So, it looks at
[05:54] high performing videos in our niche. It
[05:55] looks at comments of what our audience
[05:57] is looking for. And then it helps us out
[05:58] with packaging for three new ideas every
[06:00] single day. So, let's go over to the
[06:02] Google sheet and go to the third tab,
[06:03] which is our niche daily insights. So,
[06:05] these are the five best performing
[06:07] videos right now if you went and
[06:08] searched nen in the past week. And once
[06:10] again, we're getting the same type of
[06:11] data as far as title, URL, thumbnail,
[06:13] views, likes, power words, and thumbnail
[06:15] analysis. Okay. From there, phase four
[06:17] is we actually analyze comments. So we
[06:19] can see that every day we're going to
[06:20] get one new row and we're going to have
[06:22] good, bad, and things we need to do. So
[06:24] one good example is viewers consistently
[06:26] praise the clear, well explained and
[06:28] useful tutorial content, especially
[06:29] around setting up and using end locally
[06:31] with AI agents. Some negative comments
[06:33] that I'm getting are users are facing
[06:35] issues with errors with git commands,
[06:37] certificate verification failures, JSON
[06:39] parsing errors, WhatsApp triggers
[06:40] locally, things like that. And then
[06:42] finally, some things that the viewers
[06:44] are looking to see like tutorials on
[06:46] Reddis, Graphfana, Langchain, Postits,
[06:49] how to host Nent setup 247 on something
[06:51] like AWS, EC2, Google Cloud, VPS. And
[06:54] I'm not saying you have to make a video
[06:56] to address every single one of these
[06:57] points. But if you see things popping up
[06:59] more than just one day, maybe you should
[07:00] make a video on it. Or if you're unable
[07:02] to make a video on it, maybe you should
[07:03] try to learn that topic. All right.
[07:05] Anyways, the final phase is now the
[07:06] ideation where every day we're going to
[07:08] get one new row of three new packaged
[07:10] videos. So once again, this agent takes
[07:12] into account things that are performing
[07:14] well in our niche lately, what the
[07:16] audience is looking for lately, and then
[07:17] packages it all together, and it also
[07:19] looks at the power words and other
[07:20] thumbnail elements that are doing well.
[07:22] So we have how to run your edit in
[07:24] automations 24/7 on AWS EC2, which is
[07:27] one of the things that the audience just
[07:28] said that they wanted. And then we have
[07:29] some inspiration for a thumbnail. We've
[07:31] got budgeting AI workflows, cut costs,
[07:33] and avoid V3 API overcharges and end.
[07:36] And then once again, another inspiration
[07:38] for a thumbnail. And then finally, we
[07:39] have secure your end tunnel enro versus
[07:42] cloudflare with two FA setup and
[07:44] troubleshooting with another thumbnail
[07:46] concept right there. So that's how this
[07:47] whole system works. We have one element
[07:49] that we can trigger whenever we want. We
[07:50] have a weekly insight and then we have a
[07:52] daily insight. Okay, so I'm going to
[07:53] break down each of these phases and
[07:55] what's going on within these different
[07:56] nodes and explain why I built it this
[07:58] way. But keep in mind, you're able to
[08:00] customize this template for the way that
[08:01] you would go about your YouTube
[08:02] strategy. But real quick, I just wanted
[08:04] to talk about my thought process when I
[08:05] went to build the system. So, whenever
[08:07] I'm going to build an automation that's
[08:08] going to replace manual work, I try to
[08:10] think about what do I actually do
[08:12] manually? And it's really important to
[08:13] be able to process map and wireframe out
[08:15] the solution that you're looking to
[08:16] build. And even though you may not get
[08:18] it exactly right on your first
[08:19] wireframe, it helps you really imagine
[08:21] what you're going to do. So, for
[08:22] example, I knew that every once in a
[08:24] while I would go look at other channels
[08:26] in my niche. I would see what was
[08:27] performing well for them and then I
[08:29] would try to put my own spin on it. and
[08:30] I knew I could build an automation for
[08:31] it, but I just wanted to come into
[08:33] Excalibur and basically just kind of
[08:34] wireframe out this whole system of what
[08:37] I was doing on a weekly basis. So, I'm
[08:39] not going to dive too much into this
[08:40] actual wireframe. I don't want to bore
[08:42] you guys. But, if you do want to nerd
[08:44] out on process mapping and wireframing
[08:46] so you can build more effective systems,
[08:47] then definitely check out my plus
[08:49] community. The link for that will be
[08:50] down in the description. I've got a full
[08:51] course in here where I basically teach
[08:53] how to pick the process, map the steps,
[08:55] and wireframe it before you actually get
[08:57] into any of the building stuff with
[08:58] nitn. So, if you're interested,
[08:59] definitely check out that course.
[09:01] Anyways, let's break down what's going
[09:02] on here in phase one. In the form
[09:03] submission, I put in three channels,
[09:05] which were Nick, RobNuggets, and Simon.
[09:07] From there, I knew that I had them all
[09:08] as one item, but I wanted to loop
[09:10] through and process each one
[09:11] individually. So, I knew I had to do a
[09:13] little bit of data manipulation here in
[09:15] order to get them into three separate
[09:16] items. My solution for this was using a
[09:18] set node to set them as an array. So, on
[09:20] the left, I have three different
[09:21] channels and three separate fields. And
[09:23] I basically put them into one field
[09:24] called channels. And now I'm able to
[09:26] take that array and split it out into
[09:28] three separate items that can now be
[09:31] looped through and processed
[09:32] individually. So that's the start of the
[09:33] loop. And now we move into the process
[09:35] of scraping YouTube videos and analyzing
[09:37] stuff. So first thing I wanted to call
[09:38] out is all of the HTTP requests that you
[09:40] see in the system are using Appify. So
[09:43] Appify is basically just an app store to
[09:44] use different scrapers and we're using
[09:46] for the majority of the time this one
[09:48] called YouTube Scraper. But don't worry
[09:49] about the setup. I have everything
[09:50] already set up for you. All you need to
[09:52] do is grab an API key from Appify and
[09:54] you'll be good to go. And all you have
[09:55] to do is throw in your Ampify API token,
[09:57] which is going to be really easy. You
[09:58] just go to Appify, you go down here to
[10:00] your settings, click on API and
[10:02] integrations, and then you'll copy this
[10:04] API token right here. And don't forget,
[10:06] you can use code 38 Nate Herk for 30%
[10:07] off Ampify. And then you just paste your
[10:09] API token right there. So, we have the
[10:12] Appify actor that we want to hit. I put
[10:14] in my API key. And now we have the JSON
[10:16] body, which is where the magic really
[10:17] happens. So, I'm not going to read off
[10:18] all of these different parameters and
[10:20] what they're doing, but in simple
[10:21] English, what's going on here is it's
[10:22] going to look at this channel right
[10:23] here. So, in this case, it's looking at
[10:25] Simon Scrapes, and it's going to look
[10:26] through Simon's most popular videos, and
[10:28] just grab 30 of them back, the 30 most
[10:30] popular. So, once we have those 30
[10:32] videos where we have the title, the URL,
[10:35] the thumbnail, the view count, all the
[10:37] stuff that we want about the video, now
[10:39] we just need to manipulate a little bit
[10:40] because what I want to do is I want to
[10:41] get the 10 best performing videos in the
[10:44] past 6 months. So, the way I do that is
[10:46] first of all, I use a sort where I'm
[10:48] basically just sorting these 30 videos
[10:49] by view count and I'm descending. So now
[10:52] we basically have the number one
[10:53] performing video here and every time we
[10:55] scroll down the view count is going to
[10:58] lower. So now that our videos are in the
[11:00] right order, I wanted to set up a
[11:02] filter. So this filter is looking at the
[11:04] date that the video was uploaded and
[11:05] it's saying that the date has to be
[11:07] after today's date minus 6 months. So
[11:10] the video was uploaded within the last 6
[11:11] months. And in this case, we have 27 of
[11:13] them were, three of them weren't. So
[11:15] what I do is I move into a limit where
[11:17] I'm saying, okay, I only want to keep
[11:19] the top 10 items. So, this is just
[11:21] making sure that we're keeping the 10
[11:22] most popular videos in the past six
[11:24] months. And it's kind of annoying
[11:25] because in this Appify actor when you're
[11:27] configuring it, you have the option to
[11:29] choose a date range, which I originally
[11:31] came in here and said 6 months, and then
[11:34] I wanted to sort by popular, but it
[11:36] wasn't actually pulling the most popular
[11:37] videos. And then I came in here and I
[11:39] realized that if I filter here based on
[11:41] time, that it's going to automatically
[11:43] set the sorting parameter to newest. So,
[11:45] I wish I could just set up all the
[11:46] filters and all the sorting in here, but
[11:47] it doesn't exactly work. But this method
[11:49] does guarantee that we get what we want.
[11:52] Okay. Anyways, now that we have the 10
[11:53] videos we're looking for, it does three
[11:55] things. The first thing it does is it
[11:57] just sets the fields only the ones we
[11:59] want. So, channel title, URL, thumbnail,
[12:02] views, and likes. The second path
[12:04] actually does the title analysis. So,
[12:06] let me click into here real quick. So,
[12:07] the first thing we do is we have to give
[12:08] it a user message, which is the title of
[12:11] the video. So, right here you can see
[12:12] video title equals JSON.title. And
[12:15] remember that this is going to be
[12:16] looking at 10 videos. Here's the first
[12:18] one. Here's the second one. Here's the
[12:19] third. And we could click all the way
[12:20] through and look at all 10. And that's
[12:22] exactly why you see on the output, we
[12:24] get 10 different items, which is the
[12:26] power words from each of those 10
[12:27] titles. And then, of course, we have the
[12:28] system message, which is where the magic
[12:30] really happens. I'm not going to read
[12:31] this whole thing, but at a high level, I
[12:33] said you are an expert YouTube
[12:35] strategist and title analyzer. Your task
[12:37] is to analyze YouTube video titles and
[12:39] identify the key power words or phrases
[12:41] that make the title compelling and
[12:43] clickable. And remember, you'll get
[12:44] access to this entire system prompt when
[12:46] you download the free template. But
[12:48] besides that, I basically just said
[12:49] extract one to three power words. They
[12:51] should basically have like a big promise
[12:52] or it should sound easy or it should be
[12:54] relatable. So that's how the agent knows
[12:56] what to do. That's how it looks at 10
[12:58] titles. And then we get our power words.
[13:00] And then the final branch right here is
[13:02] the thumbnail analysis. So right now I'm
[13:04] just using OpenAI's analyze image node.
[13:06] You could try out Google Vision or
[13:08] something else if you want to, but right
[13:09] now I'm using OpenAI. I gave it a really
[13:11] quick system prompt which said, "You're
[13:13] an expert in YouTube thumbnail strategy.
[13:15] Your task is to analyze a thumbnail
[13:16] image and identify why it grabs
[13:18] attention and encourages clicks. Focus
[13:20] on what the viewer sees or feels, the
[13:22] implicit promise or curiosity the image
[13:24] creates. Be concise and keep your answer
[13:26] simple. All this kind of stuff. And you
[13:27] may have noticed in the demo that some
[13:29] of these titles in here were actually
[13:30] kind of getting cut off like
[13:31] mid-sentence. That's just because for
[13:33] the sake of the demo, I changed the
[13:35] length of description to 50 tokens. So
[13:37] if we change that back, we'd get the
[13:38] full analysis, but I wanted to keep the
[13:40] Google sheet looking clean for the demo
[13:42] and didn't realize it would just cut off
[13:43] the words. But anyways, as you guys
[13:45] could tell, it was clearly looking at
[13:46] the image and it was able to analyze it.
[13:49] And it's super handy because what
[13:51] happens is when we use this Appify
[13:52] scraper to look at a video, it gives us
[13:55] the actual URL of the thumbnail. So, we
[13:56] can just drag that right in here and
[13:58] then OpenAI analyzes it. All right,
[14:00] sweet. And then we just basically merge
[14:02] together those three outputs so we get
[14:04] everything that we want in one clean
[14:05] line. And then we can just write it back
[14:07] to Google sheet. We write it back to
[14:09] that first tab. And we just had to drag
[14:10] in what we wanted, which was the
[14:12] channel, the title, the URL, the
[14:15] thumbnail. It was just a simple drag and
[14:16] drop from here. And then obviously the
[14:18] power words came from our title
[14:19] analyzer. And our thumbnail analysis
[14:22] came from our analyze thumbnail node
[14:23] where I just dragged in the actual
[14:25] analysis. Okay, cool. So that's phase
[14:27] one. And that is how we end up with this
[14:29] output over here where we have three
[14:31] different channels. We have their 10
[14:33] best performing videos from the past 6
[14:34] months. And now we have a pattern bank
[14:36] to analyze and to get inspiration from.
[14:38] All right. All right. So then that
[14:39] brings us down here to phase two, which
[14:41] is the weekly broad niche insights. This
[14:43] trigger right here is a schedule
[14:45] trigger, and it's going to go off every
[14:46] Sunday at 5:00 a.m. After this goes off,
[14:48] it's going to grab our broad niche. So I
[14:51] put mine as artificial intelligence, you
[14:53] can set that to whatever your broad
[14:54] niche is. If your targeted niche is
[14:56] fitness, maybe you put this as health or
[14:58] well-being, something like that. And
[14:59] then we're going to feed this broad
[15:00] niche into another Apify actor, which is
[15:03] the same YouTube scraper one. You'll put
[15:05] your token in there once again. And then
[15:07] we feed it down here into the body
[15:09] request. So once again, not going to
[15:11] read all of this, but in simple English,
[15:12] what's happening here is Appify is going
[15:15] to search YouTube for artificial
[15:16] intelligence. It's going to sort it
[15:18] based on views. It's going to sort it
[15:20] based on only videos in the last week,
[15:21] and then it's just going to grab those
[15:23] top five. But once again, we get stuff
[15:25] like title, URL, thumbnail, views,
[15:27] likes, all this kind of stuff. And I'm
[15:29] not even going to click into the title
[15:30] or thumbnail analyzer because it does
[15:32] the exact same thing as these two up
[15:34] here. So, just to save you guys some
[15:35] time, I basically copy and pasted those
[15:37] nodes down here. And then we write it
[15:38] back to the Google sheet on the second
[15:40] tab where we throw in the date, the
[15:42] channel, the title, and then all this
[15:43] other information just like you guys saw
[15:45] on that first one. And then we have our
[15:47] five new insights on our broad niche for
[15:49] today, June 23rd. All right. And now
[15:51] phase three, four, and five, which is
[15:52] one automation all strung together. And
[15:55] this is where it gets really tailored
[15:56] towards you and your niche. So, this
[15:59] schedule trigger is actually going to go
[16:00] off every single day, and it's going to
[16:01] go off at 6:00 a.m. Once it goes off,
[16:03] it's going to grab your niche. So, I
[16:05] just put Nitn. It's pretty clearly my
[16:07] niche here. And then we're going to once
[16:08] again do another one of those YouTube
[16:09] scrapers on Appify. That's the exact
[16:11] same one. You'll put in your API key
[16:13] here as well. And then all we're doing
[16:15] here is pretty much the exact same
[16:16] search as the node right above us right
[16:19] now, except for we're searching now for
[16:20] NADN rather than artificial
[16:22] intelligence. So, hope it's not too
[16:24] repetitive, but we analyze those titles,
[16:25] we analyze those thumbnails. Once again,
[16:27] packaging is so important. We write it
[16:29] to that third tab in the Google sheet.
[16:31] And now we move on to the actual fun
[16:33] stuff, which is phase four and phase
[16:35] five, comments analysis, and ideation.
[16:38] So before you run this template, you'll
[16:39] want to come into this node as well. And
[16:40] you'll want to set this as your URL for
[16:43] your YouTube channel, because we're
[16:44] going to take this YouTube channel URL
[16:46] and we're going to feed it into this
[16:48] next node, which is the Apify actor.
[16:50] You'll throw in your API key. And now
[16:52] let's look at what's going on in this
[16:53] body request. So, this is going to go to
[16:55] my YouTube channel right here, and it's
[16:57] just going to grab the five newest
[16:58] videos that I've uploaded. And when we
[17:00] do that, the most important thing that
[17:02] we get back here is the actual URL of
[17:04] the video. So, if I open this in a new
[17:05] tab, it would open up my YouTube video
[17:07] right there. So, because we have five
[17:09] YouTube videos and five YouTube video
[17:11] URLs, we can feed this into a different
[17:13] Appify actor. And this one is a YouTube
[17:16] comments actor. So, you'll throw in your
[17:17] exact same API key, though. All the
[17:19] Appify ones will take the same API key.
[17:21] And now let's take a look at what we're
[17:22] doing in the body request, which is
[17:24] really simple. It's basically just going
[17:25] to go to this YouTube video right here.
[17:28] It's going to grab 30 comments, and it's
[17:30] sorting by one, which means newest
[17:33] videos. And if you're curious how I got
[17:34] that one, I basically came to the actor
[17:36] itself. I set up, okay, here's the video
[17:38] I want to scrape. Here's how many
[17:40] comments I want. And then I can sort by
[17:41] either top comments or newest. And if I
[17:44] sort by newest, and I go to JSON, all I
[17:46] have to do is copy this request into
[17:48] NAN. And one means sorting by newest.
[17:50] So, that's what's going on here. It's
[17:52] getting the 30 newest comments from all
[17:54] five of these YouTube videos right here,
[17:56] as you can see. And so, what we get is
[17:58] 139 comments, probably just because one
[18:00] of the newer ones doesn't yet have 30 or
[18:02] more comments. So, we have 139 comments,
[18:05] and we want the AI agent to look at all
[18:07] 139 in one go. So, the solve for that is
[18:10] we use an aggregate node. We aggregate
[18:12] the field called comment. So, this one
[18:14] right here. And what we get is one item
[18:15] that has all 139 comments in it right
[18:18] there. So because we have everything in
[18:20] one spot, we can feed that directly into
[18:22] the comments analyzer agent. So first
[18:24] thing to call out is we have a user
[18:26] message where I'm giving it the
[18:27] comments. So I basically just dragged in
[18:29] this array of comments and then I use
[18:31] this join function just to split every
[18:34] comment. So it puts two new lines in
[18:35] between each one. So it's very clear to
[18:37] the agent, you know, this is one
[18:39] comment, this is one comment, this is
[18:41] one comment. And then the system message
[18:42] is basically saying that you are a
[18:44] YouTube audience insight analyst. You're
[18:47] going to be given a collection of real
[18:48] YouTube comments from the past two
[18:50] weeks. And I should probably change that
[18:51] because that's actually not true. But
[18:52] anyways, its task is to identify
[18:54] patterns in the comments for three
[18:57] categories. Things you're doing well,
[18:58] things the audience doesn't like, and
[19:00] things the audience is looking for. And
[19:02] then it's able to actually output them
[19:03] into three different parts. Doing well,
[19:05] audience dislikes, and audience
[19:07] requests. Because we use a require
[19:09] specific output format. And if I click
[19:10] into my output parser right here, you
[19:12] can see that it's basically telling the
[19:13] AI agent to output these three different
[19:16] fields. And that's exactly what we get
[19:18] on this right hand side. And then all we
[19:20] have to do is write that to the fourth
[19:21] tab of the Google sheet, which is called
[19:23] comment analysis. We throw in the date.
[19:26] And then we're just throwing in the
[19:27] output for the doing well branch, the
[19:30] audience dislikes branch, and the
[19:32] audience requests. And as you can see,
[19:34] I'm once again using that dot join
[19:36] function just to split everything up to
[19:37] make it more readable in our Google
[19:39] sheet. It just makes it more readable
[19:41] for us when we go to our Google sheet
[19:43] and we actually want to look at what the
[19:45] agent found. All right. And finally, we
[19:47] move on to probably the best part, which
[19:49] is the ideation because it basically is
[19:51] going to take into account what this
[19:52] agent found, what this agent found, and
[19:55] then help us come up with some new
[19:56] ideas. So, the first thing I'm doing is
[19:58] I'm pulling in the data that was found
[20:00] over here in phase three. Yes, I could
[20:01] have just used it as a variable since it
[20:03] was all in the same flow, but I thought
[20:05] it would be easier just to pull it in
[20:06] from Google Sheets. So, that's exactly
[20:07] what I'm doing in this tab right here.
[20:09] I'm getting all the rows from the niche
[20:10] daily sheet, and I'm doing one filter,
[20:12] which is saying I only want to get rows
[20:14] where the date equals today's date. And
[20:17] that's how we can ensure we're only
[20:18] getting in the five that were just found
[20:19] today. Now, we're ready to basically do
[20:21] the same thing where we want the agent
[20:23] to look at all five in one try. So, we
[20:25] aggregate everything. And then, you'll
[20:27] have to come in here and set your own
[20:29] channel description. So, I literally
[20:30] went to chatbt and said, "Hey, based on
[20:32] what you know about me, write me a quick
[20:34] description of my YouTube channel." And
[20:36] so, it gave me this. Nate her creates
[20:38] practical beginner friendly videos that
[20:39] teach people how to build AI automations
[20:41] using any. So, now we have all that we
[20:43] need to give to our creative agent in
[20:45] order to help us come up with some new
[20:46] video ideas. So, if I click into this
[20:48] agent, we can see first of all the user
[20:50] message that I give it. I'm giving it
[20:52] all of the titles from today, all of the
[20:54] power words from today, all of the
[20:56] different thumbnail analysises, however
[20:59] you say that plural, and then what the
[21:01] audience is looking for from our
[21:02] comments. So on the right hand side, you
[21:04] can see it has titles, power words,
[21:05] thumbnails, and what the audience wants
[21:07] more of. So it looks through the user
[21:09] message and it looks through its system
[21:10] prompt to give us the packaging for
[21:12] three new videos. But real quick, let's
[21:13] take a quick look at the system message.
[21:16] So I said, you are a top tier YouTube
[21:18] strategist and content ideation expert.
[21:20] You help YouTube creators generate high
[21:22] performing video ideas based on proven
[21:24] title patterns, power words, and
[21:26] thumbnail styles in their niche. So, I
[21:28] told it what I was going to give it. I
[21:29] told it what its goal is. And then, of
[21:31] course, down here, I have to give it the
[21:33] description of the channel that it's
[21:34] working for. So, that's where we drag in
[21:36] this little variable here, which
[21:38] basically says, okay, here's the channel
[21:40] that you need to help create videos for.
[21:41] Then, I gave it some final guidelines
[21:43] down here. Of course, you'll be able to
[21:45] access this whole thing for free when
[21:46] you download the template, so I'm not
[21:47] going to spend too much time there. And
[21:48] then like I said, we get three different
[21:50] videos with title and thumbnail pairs.
[21:52] So then the last step here really is
[21:53] just to write that back into our Google
[21:55] sheet. We are writing that to the last
[21:57] sheet called ideation and we're dragging
[21:58] in the variables from our creative agent
[22:01] right into the Google sheet. And then
[22:02] just as a quick bonus, I'm sending
[22:04] myself a Slack notification. So I can
[22:06] wake up. I can see this notification in
[22:07] my Slack and I can actually just click
[22:09] on this link that I put in here, which
[22:10] is just the Google sheet. And this is
[22:12] what it looks like. Your niche and
[22:13] channel audit for 2025 June 23rd is
[22:15] complete. View the results here. So, I
[22:17] click on that link and it takes us to
[22:19] the spreadsheet with our niche insights.
[22:21] So, that's basically the entire flow.
[22:23] There's lots of ways that I can imagine
[22:24] building on top of this and extending
[22:26] the functionality to make it even more
[22:27] useful. One idea that I think would be
[22:29] pretty cool would be an agent that helps
[22:31] you with your positioning. So, maybe
[22:32] it's able to look through that database
[22:34] of patterns and power words and stuff
[22:36] like that and you can be able to talk to
[22:38] it on a conversational level and also
[22:39] say, "Hey, I made a video about, you
[22:41] know, I used image generation to create
[22:44] LinkedIn posts for me. Can you help me
[22:45] package it?" and it would look through
[22:46] different stuff in the niche and
[22:48] different proven patterns and it would
[22:50] help you package it. So that's one
[22:51] thing. Another thing I think would be
[22:52] cool would be like in the ideation
[22:54] phase, maybe we have an agent that's
[22:56] doing research about our broader niche
[22:58] or even our targeted niche and kind of
[23:00] looking at things that have happened
[23:01] within the past couple days and maybe it
[23:03] can help you with your content calendar
[23:04] of different topics to make some videos
[23:06] on. But anyways, the most important
[23:07] thing here is just to download this
[23:09] template, start playing around with it
[23:10] and see how you want to customize it to
[23:12] fit your YouTube strategy. So, if you
[23:14] want to download this template for free,
[23:15] all you got to do is go to my free
[23:17] school community. The link for that will
[23:18] be in the description and in the pinned
[23:19] comment. Once you get here, it'll look
[23:21] like this. You will want to click on
[23:23] YouTube resources and find the post
[23:25] associated with this video. If you can't
[23:27] find it here, all you have to do is copy
[23:29] and paste the title of the video into
[23:30] the search bar and it will pop right up.
[23:32] But let's say this is the post. Right
[23:34] here, you'll see a JSON file which you
[23:35] can download and import straight into
[23:37] your NDN. And then also if you want that
[23:39] Google sheet template with all these
[23:40] tabs and columns already set up. All you
[23:42] have to do is in this post you will see
[23:44] a Google sheet template link right here
[23:46] and you can make a copy of that and then
[23:48] hook everything up. When you download
[23:50] that template there will be a full setup
[23:51] guide right here with all of the links
[23:53] and the discount codes and telling you
[23:55] everything that you need to do in order
[23:57] to get the system up and running for
[23:58] yourself. Like I said the most important
[24:00] thing is being able to understand how do
[24:01] I do this process manually and then how
[24:03] can I automate it based on that. And in
[24:05] order to do that, I really encourage
[24:07] process mapping and wireframing, which
[24:08] once again you can learn about in my
[24:10] plus group. We've got a great community
[24:11] of members who are building with NN
[24:13] every day. So they're always sharing
[24:14] their challenges and their resources and
[24:16] their wins. And of course, we've got a
[24:17] full classroom section with two courses,
[24:19] agent zero, which is the foundations for
[24:21] beginners of AI automation. And then 10
[24:23] hours to 10 seconds where we learn how
[24:25] to identify, design, and build
[24:27] time-saving automations with NED. We've
[24:29] also got stuff like step-by-step builds
[24:30] and live call recordings. So definitely
[24:32] check out the community if you're
[24:33] interested in this kind of stuff. Hey
[24:35] guys, while editing this, I realize that
[24:37] you would all kill me if I didn't go
[24:38] over pricing because I'm able to analyze
[24:40] my comments and see that. But anyways,
[24:42] let's real quick do a pricing breakdown.
[24:43] And it's really, really not bad at all.
[24:45] The main cost here that you're going to
[24:47] have is these five different actors. And
[24:50] the first four are using the YouTube
[24:52] scraper, which is this one. And it is $5
[24:54] for a,000 videos. And here we're getting
[24:56] 90 videos. We're getting five five. So,
[25:00] it's really going to take you a while to
[25:01] hit that $5 mark. And then this final
[25:03] one right here where we're getting
[25:04] comments, this one is $1.30 for a,000
[25:07] comments. And at most every day in this
[25:09] node, we're pulling in 150 comments. So,
[25:11] once again, it'll take you multiple days
[25:13] to hit that $1.30 mark. So, actor price
[25:16] is not that bad, especially if you use
[25:18] code 38 herk to get 30% off API. And
[25:20] then your only other costs are the open
[25:22] router cost and the OpenAI cost to
[25:24] analyze the images. And both of these
[25:26] are not too bad at all. It's a very
[25:28] minimal amount of credits. You obviously
[25:30] have to keep your billing information in
[25:31] there so you can have credits. But like
[25:33] for example, if we look at all the GPT
[25:35] 4.1 mini models that I'm using, if I go
[25:37] to my activity and open router, you can
[25:38] see that it's super super minimal. Each
[25:40] call is costing not even anywhere close
[25:42] to 1 cent. So it'll take a long time for
[25:45] you to even hit a dollar with this
[25:46] system. And also, while I'm editing, I
[25:48] thought of one more thing that I could
[25:49] do to enhance this workflow, which would
[25:51] be looking at the transcripts of these
[25:52] wellperforming videos and analyzing the
[25:54] hooks and then having the creative agent
[25:56] help us generate some hooks as well. and
[25:58] we can build a pattern bank of hooks
[26:00] that work well. Anyways, that's going to
[26:01] do it for this one. Hope you guys
[26:03] enjoyed the video. Hope you learned
[26:04] something new. If you did, please give
[26:05] it a like. It definitely helps me out a
[26:07] ton. And as always, I appreciate you
[26:08] guys making it to the end of the video.
[26:10] I'll see youall on the next one. Thanks
[26:12] so much.
