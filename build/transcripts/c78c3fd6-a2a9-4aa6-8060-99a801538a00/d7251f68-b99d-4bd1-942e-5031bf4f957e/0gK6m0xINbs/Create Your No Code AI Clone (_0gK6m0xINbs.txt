[00:00] Hey guys, in this video I'm going to be
[00:01] showing you how to set up your own Hen
[00:03] avatar soar so you can automate content
[00:04] creation. And guess what? I'm an AI
[00:06] clone of Nate. Sorry guys, I had to do
[00:08] that to you. Had to see if you were
[00:09] impressed by the quality of the video or
[00:10] not. But what I'm going to do is show
[00:11] you how to set up this workflow that's
[00:13] super super simple so that you can
[00:14] automate that type of content creation
[00:16] with your own avatar, with your own
[00:18] voice. And it's going to be super cool
[00:19] and not too hard at all. All right, so
[00:21] we're just going to jump right into it
[00:22] and I'm going to walk you guys through
[00:23] every single step. So I'm at Hey Genen.
[00:25] You can get to Hey GenE using the link
[00:26] in the description and I'm just going to
[00:27] go ahead and create an account real
[00:29] quick. Okay, so now that we're in Hen,
[00:30] we have a ton of different options. And
[00:32] what we're going to be focusing on today
[00:33] is creating our own avatar, our own
[00:35] voice, and then using that over an API
[00:36] in NAND. So, we can completely automate
[00:38] all of this content creation. And now
[00:40] it's basically telling us that we need
[00:41] to submit 2 to 5 minutes of footage with
[00:43] a camera where we are looking directly
[00:45] into the camera. We're talking. We're
[00:47] doing natural generic gestures with our
[00:49] hands and stuff like that. And this is
[00:50] what it's going to use to create our
[00:52] avatar. And it's going to use this to
[00:54] mimic all of the videos that we want to
[00:56] create. Okay, so just finished that up.
[00:57] As you guys can see, I only had to do
[00:58] about 30 seconds, so I just kind of
[01:00] smiled and used hand gestures and talked
[01:02] about what it is I do, all that kind of
[01:04] stuff. It was random. Okay, so it says
[01:05] that our avatar is ready. I'm just going
[01:06] to go ahead and name this Nate Herk and
[01:08] confirm that we are good to go here.
[01:10] When we submitted that footage, it's
[01:11] also going to clone our voice. But if
[01:13] you already have a voice clone you
[01:14] really like of yourself on something
[01:15] like 11 Labs, you can also go ahead and
[01:17] pull that in. All right, so I'm a little
[01:18] nervous, but let's click into this
[01:19] avatar and see what it looks like. We'll
[01:21] check out this. Hey Nate Hurkeleman,
[01:23] your hyperrealistic avatar is ready. Try
[01:25] creating videos with it. Okay, that's
[01:27] really not too bad. So now we can access
[01:29] this avatar over API, which is going to
[01:31] be pretty cool. And we can obviously
[01:33] say, hey, here's exactly the script you
[01:34] need to read off and we'll be good to
[01:36] go. I'm going to come in here and just
[01:38] to test this out and see how it works,
[01:40] I'm going to manually type in this text
[01:42] field and just throw in some information
[01:44] that I want to say. Okay, so I filled in
[01:46] some text and all we're going to do now
[01:47] is hit test step. And what this does is
[01:49] it's basically sending a request over to
[01:51] Hey Gen servers and saying, "Cool, we've
[01:54] started working on that video." And what
[01:55] we get back is a video ID. And then all
[01:57] we need to do is feed over the actual
[01:59] video ID. So I'm going to call this one
[02:01] get video. And we'll hit test step. And
[02:03] we will see if we get a video. The
[02:04] status is complete. And let's open this
[02:07] up real quick and take a
[02:10] look. Hey guys, in this video I'm going
[02:12] to be showing you how to set up your own
[02:13] Hey Gen avatar so you can automate
[02:15] content creation. And guess what? I'm an
[02:17] AI clone of Nate. If you want to watch
