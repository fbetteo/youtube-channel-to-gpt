[00:00] Here's how you can build anything with
[00:01] Lovable and Nad. Okay, so this is all
[00:03] I'm going to start with just to show you
[00:04] guys how simple this is. I said, "Help
[00:06] me create a web app called Get Me Out of
[00:08] This where a user can submit a problem
[00:10] they're having." Then I said to use this
[00:11] image as design inspiration. So I
[00:13] Googled landing page design inspiration
[00:15] and I'm just going to take a quick
[00:16] screenshot of this landing page, copy
[00:18] that, and then paste it into Lovable.
[00:21] And then we'll fire this off. Cool. So I
[00:22] just sent that off. And on the right
[00:24] hand side, we're seeing it's going to
[00:25] spin up a preview. So this is where
[00:27] we'll see the actual web app that it's
[00:28] created and get to interact with it.
[00:30] Right now it's going to come through and
[00:31] start creating some code. And then on
[00:32] the lefth hand side is where we're going
[00:34] to have that back and forth chat window
[00:35] to talk to lovable in order to make
[00:37] changes for us. Okay. So now it looks
[00:39] like it finished that up. And as you can
[00:40] see we have the website filled up. And
[00:43] so it created all of this with just uh
[00:45] an image as inspiration as well as just
[00:47] me telling it one sentence help me
[00:49] create a web app called get me out of
[00:50] this where a user can submit a problem
[00:51] they're having. So anyways, I want to
[00:53] say get me out of a boring meeting. So
[00:58] we'll hit get me out of this and we'll
[01:00] see what happens. It says submitting and
[01:02] nothing really happens. Even though it
[01:04] told us, you know, we'll get back to you
[01:05] soon. Nothing really happened. So what
[01:07] we want to do is we want to make sure
[01:09] that it knows when we hit this button,
[01:10] it's going to send that data to our nen
[01:12] web hook. But I'm just going to go back
[01:14] into naden. We have the web hook. We'll
[01:16] click on this right here. Back into
[01:17] lovable. basically just saying when I
[01:19] click get me out of this, so this button
[01:20] right here, send the data to this web
[01:22] hook. So I'm saying that I overslept and
[01:24] I'm running late. I'm going to submit
[01:26] this and we'll pop into nitn and you can
[01:27] see now that it's running and then when
[01:29] it sends the response to the web hook,
[01:31] we'll get that response in our lovable
[01:33] web app. And now we have the response in
[01:35] a clean format, which is I accidentally
[01:36] hit the snooze button and tell it filed
[01:38] for a restraining order against me for
[01:39] harassment. So the first thing I want to
[01:41] do just for fun is create a level
[01:42] system. So every time someone submits a
[01:44] problem, they're going to get a point.
[01:46] And if they get five points, they'll
[01:47] level up. If they get 20 total points,
[01:49] they'll level up again. Okay, so I just
[01:50] sent off create a dynamic level system.
[01:53] Every time a user submits a problem,
[01:55] they get a point. Everyone starts at
[01:56] level one and after five points, they
[01:58] reach level two. Then after 50 more
[02:00] points, they reach level three. Okay, so
[02:01] it looks like it just created a level
[02:03] system. It's reloading up our preview so
[02:05] we can see what that looks like now. Um,
[02:07] looks like there may have been an error,
[02:08] but now, as you can see right here, we
[02:10] have a level system. So I'm saying my
[02:12] boss is mean. I don't want to talk to
[02:13] him. We're going to hit submit. The NN
[02:15] workflow is running right now on the
[02:16] back end and we just got a message back
[02:19] which is I'd love to chat but I've got a
[02:20] hot date with my couch and binge
[02:21] watching the entire season of Awkward
[02:23] Bosses. And you can see that we got a
[02:24] point. So four more points to unlock
[02:26] level two. If you want to watch the full
[02:28] video, the link for that will be down in
[02:29] the description.
