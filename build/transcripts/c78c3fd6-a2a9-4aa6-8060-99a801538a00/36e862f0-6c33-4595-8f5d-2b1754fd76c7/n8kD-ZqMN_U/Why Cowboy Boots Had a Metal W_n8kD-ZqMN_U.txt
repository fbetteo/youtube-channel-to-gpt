Why did cowboy boots have a metal wheel on the back in the old days? This rotating metal disc, known as a spur, was designed to gently guide the horse using the rider's leg. When the rider lightly pressed the boot, the spur touched the horse's side and helped steer it. This offered a more precise signal than vocal commands or knee pressure. The rotating wheel instead of a fixed spike spread the pressure more evenly, allowing the rider to encourage movement without harming the horse's skin or tissue.
