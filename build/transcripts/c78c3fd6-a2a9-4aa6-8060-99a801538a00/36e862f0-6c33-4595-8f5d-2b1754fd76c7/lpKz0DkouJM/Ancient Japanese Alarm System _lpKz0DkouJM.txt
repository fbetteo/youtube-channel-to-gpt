No matter how quietly you step on this floor, you'll still hear it creek. The deliberately squeaky floors of ancient Japanese castles, known as night and gale floors, were used as an early alarm system. When someone stepped on them, gaps beneath the boards and loosely fixed nails created a distinct chirping sound designed to alert guards and deter intruders.
