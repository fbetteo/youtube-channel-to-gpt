This ancient device was designed over 2,000 years ago to pump water without the need for electricity or pumps. This simple system known as the Archimedes screw used minimal force and energy to move water. Placed at an incline, the rotating spiral shaft could lift liquids and granular materials upward. It was revolutionary in agricultural irrigation and the transportation of goods such as grain.
