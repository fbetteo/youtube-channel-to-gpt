Before modern technology, lawnmowers relied entirely on human power. The first lawnmowers operated without an engine. Their cylinder blades rotated like scissors, using kinetic energy based on how fast you pushed. They were silent and fuel-f free, but performance depended on the user. By the early 1900s, the first motorized models appeared, revolutionizing farming and gardening forever.
