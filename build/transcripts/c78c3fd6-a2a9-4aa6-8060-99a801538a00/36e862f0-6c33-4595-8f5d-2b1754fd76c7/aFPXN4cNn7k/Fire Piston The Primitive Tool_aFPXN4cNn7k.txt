Before modern technology, this primitive but ingenious tool allowed people to start fires quickly. Known as a fire piston, it consists of a hollow cylinder, typically made of wood or horn with a piston that can move inside. At the end of the piston is a sealing system, usually made of fiber, to prevent air leakage. A combustible material is placed at the tip. When the piston is quickly pushed into the cylinder, the air inside is compressed, causing the temperature to rise to several hundredÂ°, instantly igniting the fuel.
