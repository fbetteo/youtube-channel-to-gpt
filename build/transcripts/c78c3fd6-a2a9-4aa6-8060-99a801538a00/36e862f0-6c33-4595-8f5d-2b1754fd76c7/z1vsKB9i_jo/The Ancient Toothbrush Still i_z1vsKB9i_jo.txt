How did ancient humans keep their teeth clean and healthy without chemicals? This natural stick known as the Miswok has scientifically proven antibacterial properties. Obtained from the branches of the Salvadora perse, its fibrous texture works like a natural brush used for thousands of years to clean teeth and gums, freshen breath, and prevent gum disease. It's still widely used in Islamic countries for oral hygiene, especially before acts of worship.
