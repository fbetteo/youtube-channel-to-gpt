[00:00] I built 24 project in the past 2.5 years
[00:03] at the beginning only 25% of my project
[00:05] would make money now in the last year
[00:07] 100% of my site project made money and
[00:09] for that I had to fire the developer in
[00:11] my head to become an entrepreneur now I
[00:13] only launch product that people use love
[00:16] and pay for so that I can work on any
[00:18] project I like from anywhere in the
[00:19] world without having to worry about
[00:21] paying the bills so in this video I'm
[00:23] going to share the five developers
[00:24] mistake I made that kept my site project
[00:27] from making money mistake number one
[00:28] adding a free plan to your product
[00:30] sounds like a good idea but it's killing
[00:32] your Revenue I used to spend about a
[00:34] year on a habit tracker that had a free
[00:36] plan and a Premium plan the reason for
[00:38] the free plan is that I wanted people to
[00:39] try the product to see if it was a good
[00:41] fit and eventually if they like it they
[00:42] would upgrade to the paid plan I spent
[00:44] over a year working on it before I sold
[00:46] it last year around October and I
[00:48] managed to get 140,000 visitors to the
[00:50] website and back then I had zero
[00:52] audience so I was basically working day
[00:54] and night for that out of those 140,000
[00:56] visitors about 10,000 signed up for
[00:59] habit tracker and at the end of the year
[01:01] I made
[01:01] $6,000 knowing that I spent my entire
[01:04] year working on this that's a really
[01:06] minimal amount of money so here is the
[01:08] red pill only 3% of free users will
[01:11] upgrade to the Premium plan let's take
[01:13] an example let's say you have a free
[01:14] plan and a $10 per month plan that means
[01:17] your average user is worth 30 cents to
[01:20] your business now let's say that you
[01:21] need about $3,000 per month in order to
[01:24] maintain your lifestyle that means you
[01:25] will need 10,000 new users every month
[01:28] or about 75 5,000 monthly visitors I
[01:31] don't know how about you but that sounds
[01:33] like an insane amount of work for a solo
[01:35] entrepreneurs especially if you have a
[01:36] 925 and you have to handle everything
[01:38] for your startup from the legal the
[01:40] customer support and all that so why do
[01:42] we keep seeing free plans everywhere on
[01:44] the Internet is because all those
[01:45] startups are usually VC backed they have
[01:48] a lot of money so that they can spend
[01:49] hundreds and thousands of US dollar into
[01:51] marketing so they collect a bunch of
[01:52] user feedback and they can build the
[01:54] next unicorn but if you're like me you
[01:56] might want to stay solo and you might
[01:58] have a limited marketing budget if any
[02:00] and you cannot afford to spend thousands
[02:02] of US dollar to gather feedbacks so
[02:04] having a free plan is literally slowing
[02:06] you down in your journey to get
[02:08] profitable there are three alternatives
[02:10] to free plans in case you somehow need
[02:12] to show a part of your product to
[02:14] customers before they purchase the first
[02:15] one is offering free credits you
[02:17] basically let your users try your
[02:19] product but for a very limited usage
[02:22] just so that they know what the product
[02:23] is about without getting any benefit
[02:25] from it the second alternative is having
[02:27] a short free trial with a credit card
[02:29] ahead so as for the credit card because
[02:31] you want your users to commit email is
[02:33] on a commitment a credit card is and
[02:35] make sure your free Tri is short 7day
[02:37] maximum in order to people to commit and
[02:39] the third alternative which is my
[02:41] favorite as a developer is to take a
[02:42] standalone feature of your app and make
[02:44] it as a free tool you could see this for
[02:46] instance with ahref tool their keyword
[02:49] research tool is free and if you want to
[02:51] dig more into it you have to purchase
[02:53] their membership this is also what I do
[02:55] with one of my product called logo fast
[02:57] people can generate logos for their
[02:58] startup for free and if they want to
[03:00] build a startup by coding it they would
[03:02] have to purchase ship fast building free
[03:04] tools is amazing especially as a
[03:05] developer because first you fulfill your
[03:08] developer need of creating things the
[03:10] second part is a good way for people to
[03:12] try the product without having to sign
[03:14] up and everything and the third part is
[03:16] good for marketing and building a little
[03:18] audience because you can launch all
[03:20] those little free tools on product time
[03:22] tradit hiker news get some traffic and
[03:24] things will happen you'll learn how to
[03:25] launch and yeah overall I really
[03:27] recommend trying out free tools m number
[03:30] two is the shiny Tech syndrome every
[03:32] week I would see a tweet about the new
[03:35] nodejs killer or a YouTube video about
[03:38] the latest design Trend and the new UI
[03:40] components library to try out and just
[03:42] like as a normal developer I spent a lot
[03:44] of time in the past trying out all those
[03:46] new tools but as I started to make money
[03:48] I had less time to try this tool and
[03:50] spend more time with my users sticking
[03:51] to the same Tech stack and guess what
[03:53] happened I not only ship less bug
[03:55] because I know exactly the tools I'm
[03:56] using I was also way more productive but
[03:58] most importantly users don't care about
[04:01] the invisible users only care about one
[04:03] thing they want a solution to their
[04:05] problems and the shape or the color of
[04:07] the buttons you're using don't matter at
[04:09] all to them if you're a developer and
[04:11] you're looking to make money with your
[04:12] code all those videos and tweets are
[04:14] pure distraction these new tools and
[04:16] libraries are like an endless treadmill
[04:18] every week there will be a new trendy
[04:20] one or a new better one that improves
[04:22] the performances and it never stops and
[04:24] the only way to be productive is to pick
[04:26] one text Tack and stick to it if you
[04:28] don't have a text tack yet I will link
[04:29] somewhere in the video about the text T
[04:31] I'm currently using for all my 24
[04:33] products mistake number three
[04:35] subscriptions that's a little spicy
[04:37] topic back in May 2023 I built a landing
[04:41] page generator using AI people would pay
[04:43] $39 and so that they can type a prompt
[04:45] my software would generate an entire
[04:47] landing page for them it was working
[04:49] pretty well it was making about100 to
[04:50] $200 per day I think back then it was my
[04:53] most successful product and I decided to
[04:55] change and play around with pricing so I
[04:57] studed to charge a $5 per month
[04:59] subscription instead of a $39 one time
[05:02] payment as soon as I pushed the change
[05:04] live all my sales went down like
[05:06] literally zero for days I revert back to
[05:09] the one time payment thing and things
[05:10] started to pick up again as a developer
[05:12] or a business owner I love subscription
[05:14] it has a sense of passing income and
[05:16] it's helping me predict what's going to
[05:18] happen the next month but as a user you
[05:20] probably notice that we hate
[05:21] subscription there's some kind of
[05:23] headaches going around is because first
[05:25] you have to think about the future what
[05:27] happens if I don't use the product in 2
[05:29] weeks what happens if I forget to cancel
[05:31] the subscription there is some mental
[05:33] process that's required for people to
[05:36] pay for subscription that doesn't happen
[05:38] when you charge a onetime payment and so
[05:41] roughly selling a $49 onetime payment
[05:44] product is as hard as selling a $9 per
[05:46] month subscription the second drawback
[05:48] of subscriptions is that users turn all
[05:51] the time it's not because someone decid
[05:53] to subscribe today for your software
[05:54] that they will be paying in 6 months
[05:56] from now so unless you have an excellent
[05:58] service your users will anyway way churn
[06:00] as a business owner you probably have
[06:02] onetime payments like a book you pay
[06:04] once and you own it forever is pretty uh
[06:07] pleasurable for a customer and it's
[06:09] helping you getting your first sales
[06:10] online and depending on the product
[06:12] you're making you might have negligible
[06:14] costs of running the service for
[06:16] instance the bandwidth is usually
[06:17] negligible I have half a million page
[06:19] views per month on my app and I'm still
[06:21] on the $20 per month versal plan so even
[06:23] if the user end up costing 1 cents per
[06:25] month you're still Way Beyond
[06:27] profitability for years and if your
[06:29] service EXP Lo and there are a bunch of
[06:30] users coming up you can also grandfather
[06:32] your current users keep them using the
[06:34] product for that onetime payment and
[06:36] start implementing subscription for new
[06:38] users if you have some kind of recording
[06:40] cost let's say you are doing an AI
[06:42] wrapper around the open AI API then you
[06:44] can try the pay-per-use system just like
[06:46] open AI you would make them pay for the
[06:48] usage of your own product this is really
[06:50] fair for users there's no much mental
[06:53] energy spent on their side because if
[06:55] you don't use the product you don't pay
[06:56] that's very simple and I believe this
[06:58] pricing model is going to replace most
[07:00] subscription in a few years I recommend
[07:02] you to start as simple as you can with a
[07:04] one time payment of the pay-per-view
[07:05] system make $1,000 and then think later
[07:08] if you need to implement subscriptions
[07:10] or not mistake number four the H1 tag
[07:13] first impression matters when you meet
[07:15] someone randomly in the street how they
[07:17] behave how they look what they say will
[07:19] influence every decision you'll make
[07:21] about this person it's the same with
[07:23] your website when you're selling a
[07:24] product online your headline is the
[07:26] first impression and this is going to be
[07:28] the most influential part part on
[07:29] whether people will decide to buy or not
[07:31] your product in average a website
[07:33] conversion rate so visitors to customers
[07:35] is about 2% if you're getting started is
[07:38] likely going to be more like 1% even
[07:40] less so for 100 visitors you'll get one
[07:42] user that means that most of the people
[07:44] who visit your website will never see
[07:46] your product but 100% of the people who
[07:49] visit your website will see your
[07:50] headline so make sure you spend enough
[07:52] time crafting a really excellent
[07:54] headline before launching your headline
[07:55] should be short trigger an emotional
[07:57] reaction and answer the question of why
[08:00] would a random stranger on the internet
[08:02] give me 1 minute of their very precious
[08:04] time I wrote a short article about
[08:06] copyrighting for learning Pages you can
[08:08] check in the description the link to my
[08:10] newsletter mistake number five over
[08:12] engineering for my first
[08:13] entrepreneurship project I spent an
[08:15] entire year building a startup I wanted
[08:17] it to be perfect with a bunch of feature
[08:19] user onboarding and a dozens of screens
[08:21] by the end of the year I burn out and I
[08:23] managed to get zero users and made Zer
[08:26] actually that's this little first
[08:28] project right here that you see we've
[08:30] seen earlier that about 1% of your
[08:32] landing page will convert into paying
[08:34] customers so most people will never use
[08:36] your product and to avoid shipping
[08:37] features that people don't need I
[08:39] recommend you to try the 24 hours
[08:41] startup framework if you had to create
[08:43] any startup in 24 hours how it would
[08:45] look like if we talk about Airbnb it
[08:47] could be just a single spreadsheet and
[08:49] if we are remaking Instagram that could
[08:51] be a public Google Drive I'm not saying
[08:53] you should Che a sketchy version of your
[08:55] product but I'm saying that instead of
[08:56] having a big master plan for your
[08:58] startup start with a very tiny version
[09:01] the 24 hours version of your startup as
[09:03] a b line and start building from there
[09:06] in my case I remove a bunch of things
[09:08] from the first version of the product
[09:09] there are three categories the first one
[09:11] is that I remove anything that's
[09:12] invisible to the customer so I do not
[09:14] test my code I do not use git branches I
[09:17] ship directly to production and I do not
[09:19] use typescript and there is a big
[09:20] support button on the website in case if
[09:22] anything goes wrong but that really
[09:24] doesn't open open the second part is
[09:25] that I remove everything that doesn't
[09:27] have Direct Value to the customer so
[09:29] there is no dark mode there is no
[09:31] professional logo there is no reset
[09:33] password form for instance and finally I
[09:36] remove any secondary feature customers
[09:38] come to my website because they have one
[09:40] problem and that problem is usually
[09:41] solved with one feature anything that is
[09:44] not about that feature will be removed
[09:45] from the verse version of my product the
[09:48] goal here is to launch your product fast
[09:50] so you get real user feedback early and
[09:53] you can build the right features for
[09:54] them and make some money I have been
[09:56] building tiny startups in public on
[09:58] Twitter with 100 of other developers and
[10:00] the five mistakes I just shared is
[10:02] usually what sets apart the solo
[10:04] developers who actually end up making
[10:06] money with a site project and those who
[10:08] don't I hope this video is helpful if it
[10:10] is please let me know if you could
[10:11] subscribe to the channel That would
[10:12] means a lot and if you're one of those
[10:13] developer who overthink their side
[10:15] project I'm going to share a link to a
[10:16] video where I shipped a software in 3
[10:18] days all right that was it for this
[10:20] video and until the next one I hope you
[10:21] just ship it
