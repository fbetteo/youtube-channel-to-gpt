[00:01] one cold email $4,000 and there was no
[00:03] customer support whatsoever we need one
[00:06] cold that's it and that's the first
[00:08] making
[00:10] money other the
[00:14] balls meet Mark Lou a millionaire who
[00:17] owns exactly zero pairs of shoes and way
[00:20] more startups than You' think is
[00:22] reasonable he sits here in this
[00:24] disgustingly beautiful Tropical Paradise
[00:27] to show you how to turn ideas into trans
[00:30] strangers into clients and your boring
[00:33] job into a distant
[00:35] [Music]
[00:46] memory we finally made it yeah we
[00:48] freaking made it with maybe 6 hours
[00:50] delay but we made it yeah we got the
[00:53] Visa we have a fly ticket we're freaking
[00:55] ready to go to Australia to meet that
[00:58] person meet some
[01:00] [Music]
[01:20] we finally arrived Australia it was
[01:23] supposed to be our healing trip but the
[01:25] first day is totally brutal yeah it was
[01:27] crazy hopefully we can get a car rent
[01:30] told now ah
[01:38] Australia what's
[01:40] up that pretty
[01:42] [Music]
[01:49] good now it's 400 p.m. we tried to eat
[01:53] dinner before five Mark is actually
[01:55] having a little struggle to disconnect
[01:57] we can talk about it during this dinner
[02:00] yeah e you yeah yeah okay let's do this
[02:03] that looks
[02:07] good so actually this morning we had a
[02:09] little talk
[02:11] no yeah I'm kind of made a mistake today
[02:15] by opening the computer mhm cuz once I
[02:17] start working I kind of stop thinking I
[02:19] have to write about thinking about the
[02:20] tweets I'm going to write build features
[02:22] I have to fix bugs so many things and
[02:24] once I see something then it kind of
[02:26] never stops and it's like infinite
[02:27] treadmill you need to find the SA way to
[02:30] work well but also have a good rest to
[02:34] disconnect from work to have better
[02:36] ideas to do up or and out yeah I think
[02:39] you need to work whatever if you want to
[02:41] make something good mhm but honestly I
[02:43] think you can start with a couple hours
[02:46] like an hour a day I think it's a
[02:47] miraculous amount of time and when you
[02:49] have a constraint and your brain knows
[02:51] it has a limited amount of things those
[02:53] constraints create creativity MH because
[02:56] you know you only have one hour because
[02:57] after you have kids or you have a job
[02:59] now my weakness is that I have so much
[03:01] time because that's my work that I'm
[03:02] getting drawn into it and I'm not
[03:04] creative I'm less happy I burn out it's
[03:07] interesting because when you are Indie
[03:09] hacker people recommend to start side
[03:12] hustle along with your main work to like
[03:16] um risk management of you know yeah and
[03:19] also for that mindset your constraint
[03:22] actually make you like success faster
[03:25] because you don't have a pressure to
[03:27] succeed fast so if you just start
[03:30] don't quit your main job keep it and
[03:33] also use that rest of time wisely to
[03:37] work like a 100% yeah you go full time
[03:41] and your brain starts to have
[03:43] expectation imagine you spend you work
[03:45] 66 hours a day for like a month without
[03:48] taking time off at the end of the month
[03:50] unless you've been doing this for years
[03:52] your brain will expect results it's It's
[03:54] Perfectly Normal yeah so e it's so easy
[03:56] to burn yeah discourage burnout there's
[03:58] my brain that is like how much views are
[04:00] we going to get how much like is this we
[04:02] going to make how much money are we and
[04:04] man this is so stupid because I have not
[04:06] started the journey for that it's
[04:07] addictive I get drwn into that and I
[04:09] don't want to I need to write a plan of
[04:12] all the metrics I want to track making
[04:14] one video per week is something I really
[04:16] care making thoughtful tweets to help
[04:18] people get started building apps I want
[04:20] to keep making apps like I used to I
[04:22] think I'll take a day off a week now mhm
[04:24] I think that's important cuz human
[04:26] beings are not made to sit down and look
[04:28] at the computer for 24/7 I think
[04:30] relationships in this larning journey is
[04:32] very important at the beginning it's
[04:34] pure Faith like you you see sh for month
[04:38] nothing happens and you even start
[04:40] doubting about yourself are you good
[04:41] enough am I good enough mhm when you
[04:43] have someone that you can trust that
[04:46] tells you I trust you you're going to
[04:47] make it this is like a it's a superpower
[04:50] sometimes it's hard to see your value by
[04:51] yourself and you can be the worst enemy
[04:55] telling negative selft talk so that's
[04:57] why outside objective you is important
[05:01] and that emotional support really means
[05:04] a lot yeah should we turn off the camera
[05:06] and enjoy the yeah this is freaking good
[05:09] yeah everybody's [ __ ]
[05:12] [Music]
[05:20] good it never gets easier I 30° outside
[05:24] it wasn't easy that was a mistake but it
[05:27] was very important for the mental health
[05:30] we talked about all to be
[05:36] [Music]
[05:42] continued 8:00
[05:44] a.m. camera is rolling yeah what's your
[05:47] plan bro what's the plan bro um hike in
[05:51] the morning mhm then uh try to find some
[05:54] good food then we are going to see
[05:56] kangaroos because we're in godamn
[06:00] Australia and then we're going to meet
[06:03] that person that special person that
[06:05] special person Chang your life yep 7
[06:07] years
[06:08] [Music]
[06:22] ago
[06:24] W
[06:26] big oh hey it's beautiful wow imagine
[06:30] going all the way down to Australia to
[06:32] eat
[06:34] [Music]
[06:41] ital so cute yeah so beautiful we just
[06:45] have a lunch like it was so amazing with
[06:48] the homemade olives and it's always
[06:50] about no it was about having a time off
[06:55] to refresh our mind and then ready to go
[06:57] back to work just ship it to ship
[07:02] it what day have a life in a Solo
[07:06] preneur I don't I don't know if people
[07:09] actually have a clue of what we're
[07:11] talking about but we're going to meet
[07:13] the my first ever customer and I person
[07:15] changed my life and and your life too we
[07:18] went from like doing zero on the
[07:20] internet to making the first dollar with
[07:21] that customers we're going to meet back
[07:23] then I also meet my good you know him
[07:25] too my good friend Andre and he told me
[07:27] like sell it before you make it and I
[07:28] started to color collect emails of escap
[07:30] room businesses across the world that
[07:32] person said yes to the email so we jump
[07:34] on a call and I Tred to sell her like I
[07:35] was in my head I was completely thinking
[07:38] like an engineer so the call is super
[07:40] awkward I recorded the call and I'm like
[07:43] uh you uh I I I I I I built this this
[07:46] tool so um I um um I sent you um a demo
[07:51] of the of and she's so kind and she's
[07:54] like oh okay yeah that's that's sound
[07:56] interesting and she said yes and she
[07:57] spent around in toal I think around3 or
[08:01] $4,000 for the software one call emails
[08:05] one call $4,000 M crazy one of the
[08:09] reason most entrepreneurs never make
[08:10] money is because they build things
[08:12] people don't want and so if you don't
[08:14] ask customers before you're just going
[08:16] to end up spending 3 months building a
[08:18] product that nobody will want cuz we
[08:19] convince oursel oh this is a good idea
[08:21] this is going to work the truth the
[08:22] numbers shows that most of the time
[08:25] nobody wants the product what made you
[08:28] convince persuaded the customers to buy
[08:31] your product I make it sound like a
[08:34] no-brainer I told her this cost this
[08:36] amount of money and if you use it well
[08:39] you're going to get 3x the same amount
[08:40] of money I was I'm really sure of this
[08:43] was ever going to work in the worst case
[08:45] I can refound her if I messed up in my
[08:47] calculation so there's no big deal
[08:49] there's no string attach it's not about
[08:51] the product it's not about your product
[08:53] it's about the outcome for the business
[08:54] when you invest in the marketing tool
[08:56] it's like you expect a return on
[08:58] investment on the call I would use that
[08:59] to explain more how this would work see
[09:02] their objections see where they tell you
[09:04] like ah I'm not sure M so ask questions
[09:07] because you might realize that your
[09:09] product is not a good fit and instead
[09:11] another product could be a good fit and
[09:12] you will be surprised how
[09:15] much people are willing to let you know
[09:18] their struggles what else can I help you
[09:20] with you know is there anything you
[09:21] struggle with that I can make easier for
[09:24] you that is the right mindset I think to
[09:26] have and it's it feels much more genuine
[09:29] to sell something to someone that way
[09:30] that's
[09:31] true so
[09:33] [Music]
[09:35] cute I don't know who is the animal
[09:42] here oh the balls he has massive balls
[09:46] are you blind oh sorry are you okay
[09:50] they're all blind look at their eyes
[09:52] they all sleepy what is this kind of
[09:54] food like
[09:56] chalk oh oh
[10:00] [Music]
[10:05] so uh bummer the Escapo business was
[10:09] closed today today's Wednesday so we
[10:12] didn't get to see danela the owner of
[10:14] the Escapo business and I didn't get to
[10:16] show you my first customer but uh
[10:17] instead let me show you how I made
[10:19] $4,000 with one Cod email okay so we are
[10:22] early 2018 I have Zer I am doing some
[10:26] gigs for movies to make a couple hundred
[10:28] dollars a month so I can survive I need
[10:30] to make money so what if I help some
[10:33] kind of business I care about get more
[10:34] customers in using a product that I
[10:37] create what if I make puzzles for escape
[10:39] rooms that they can use those puzzles
[10:41] for them to get more customers so I go
[10:43] on yel I type escape room in whatever
[10:46] City I don't care because I'll never go
[10:47] there I'll use the internet to reach
[10:49] them out I pick any escape room then I
[10:51] open their website and here manually I
[10:54] go to the contact page and then I sell
[10:56] them an email this is a real email that
[10:58] would sent um 2018 I personalize every
[11:02] email so for that I use the name of the
[11:04] business owner to do that I go on the
[11:06] yel page and usually in the reviews um
[11:09] sometimes the the business owner would
[11:11] reply to a customer or a customer would
[11:12] mention a staff member that was really
[11:14] helpful I would use that email I explain
[11:17] why I'm reaching out I go straight to
[11:18] the point I'm trying to help escape room
[11:20] businesses increase their booking rate I
[11:22] personalize even more I say I know how
[11:24] much reviews you have on y but I noticed
[11:27] there is something you could do better I
[11:29] put myself as the bridge to get more
[11:31] customers and the C to action is you can
[11:34] pick any slot on my calendar I'm an
[11:36] engineer I feel super uncomfortable and
[11:39] it's somewhere in the middle of 2018 I
[11:41] flew to Japan cheapest flight cheapest
[11:43] guest house I have $0 I have to do a
[11:45] Visa Run and one of those leads decided
[11:48] to jump on a CO with me I wrote a few
[11:50] things back then where why having this
[11:52] marketing tool it would help them uh
[11:54] what they're missing out um I have a
[11:57] little plan on what I'm going to tell
[11:59] them but it's mostly me just awkward
[12:01] trying to to tell them something but
[12:03] surprisingly that person danela from the
[12:06] escape from business we were supposed to
[12:08] visit today uh decide to move forward
[12:10] and says yes I'm happy to get this going
[12:13] and here we go the ball was running I
[12:14] ended up making building the software
[12:16] for her it looks like this so it's on
[12:18] Facebook Messenger it's like a bot where
[12:20] it's automated messages so people
[12:22] customer their customers could go here
[12:24] uh start a little challenge they say oh
[12:26] I want to play the parking spots game
[12:29] and then the messenger bot would
[12:30] challenge them like here um there's was
[12:33] there was a murder in bangalo uh here
[12:35] are three potential suspects which one
[12:37] killed Rose there would be buttons for
[12:40] people to type there are like 10 20
[12:42] games like this that are built and in
[12:43] the end the customer can get an escape
[12:45] room this is just 5% but you earn a 5%
[12:47] coupon for the escape room this would
[12:49] increase escape room business's
[12:50] conversion rate and just that one call
[12:52] with danela was enough to get one
[12:54] customer she spent I think around $4,000
[12:58] on the business because she keeps paying
[13:00] for on and off four to 5 years just one
[13:03] cold email this is pretty crazy I would
[13:04] structure my days based on that so in
[13:06] the morning I would do marketing and
[13:08] sales so I would go back to yel Trip
[13:10] Advisor uh find five or 10 escape room
[13:13] businesses basically I would have
[13:14] different stages of pipeline the first
[13:16] one would be uh just the lead itself I
[13:18] haven't sent any email then would be
[13:20] stage number two I sent one email two
[13:21] email three emails and then at the
[13:23] fourth email I would just move on and
[13:24] close it I would automate the email
[13:26] sending so every time an email has been
[13:29] sent on stage two if it wasn't uh
[13:31] replied from the customer it would move
[13:33] on to stage three I would have four
[13:35] templates one per stage to make sure
[13:36] that I'm not missing out any leads and
[13:39] this was 6 years ago and now the
[13:40] business is closed Co basically killed
[13:43] the business here uh 2020 espr business
[13:45] is closed but as you can see it went up
[13:47] to I think four a little bit over 4,000
[13:49] mother must recurring Revenue which is
[13:51] just excellent for me I was so happy
[13:53] because it was my first dollar on the
[13:54] internet uh the entire business was
[13:56] built on top of cold emails that said
[13:59] that's the only thing I did that worked
[14:01] he made around $770,000 plus I think
[14:03] around $1 to $15,000 on PayPal and this
[14:06] is just me doing cold email for like one
[14:08] year or something and what's even more
[14:09] crazy they have the customers who ended
[14:11] up loving the product so much they spent
[14:15] 13,000 us on this product and there was
[14:17] no customer support whatsoever we did
[14:20] one call that's it that's why I think
[14:22] Cod emails for any B2B businesses are
[14:24] really really underrated and should
[14:26] definitely dig somewhere here I also
[14:28] learned how marketing because I am a
[14:30] developer and it felt so awkward to sell
[14:32] something and some people say like sorry
[14:34] I cannot afford it right now and I
[14:35] realize this means that she does not see
[14:38] the value in the product but of course
[14:40] she can afford it if there is the value
[14:42] all those learnings from C emails and
[14:43] calls which are very hard to do are very
[14:46] Foundation of marketing that's why I
[14:47] really recommend start with a random
[14:50] business idea just pick something that
[14:52] exists already where you see money is
[14:53] already flowing find a way to make it
[14:55] yours add your signature me it was
[14:57] adding little games make turning the
[14:59] like marketing things into a
[15:00] gamification tool you might not build
[15:02] the exact business you have in mind
[15:04] right now but you're going to end up
[15:05] making something people actually want
[15:08] and that's the first step into making
[15:09] money on the
[15:16] [Music]
[15:27] internet how was the workout
[15:32] holy [ __ ] you scared the of
[15:36] me I just came back from kangaroo lens
[15:40] and I have so much work to done so now
[15:42] it's time to look
[15:45] [Music]
[15:47] in this is happening um YouTube sent me
[15:51] a little message the say it's time to
[15:54] celebrate I'm going to redeem this
[15:55] little thing right here it's so fun
[15:57] because I still watch a lot of YouTube
[15:59] videos and whenever I see a Creator
[16:00] showing these in the background I'm like
[16:02] a that would be amazing to have this in
[16:04] my room but it's impossible and it isn't
[16:07] it's it's real uh I'm going to show you
[16:08] the process how that goes okay so they
[16:10] gave me this little uh code here and I
[16:12] can redeem the award I have no idea
[16:15] what's next there we go this is the
[16:17] thing that's going to be in the room in
[16:18] the background oh I can input any name
[16:20] here okay that's going to be displayed
[16:22] right here approve and check out and
[16:25] there we go it's shipping to friends
[16:27] it's taking about to 3 weeks and I think
[16:30] we should be around friends in a month
[16:33] so uh yeah prepare the unboxing in the
[16:35] next
[16:36] videos I am trying to grow this software
[16:39] data fast to $1 million uh now what I
[16:42] mean $1 million it's the valuation so if
[16:44] we uh take a four multiple which is a
[16:47] generous multiple for software uh we
[16:49] take the monthly recording Revenue so
[16:51] 21,000 in monthly recing Revenue uh
[16:54] annualized on 12 month that's about a
[16:56] quar a million dollar times 4 that a
[16:59] million dollar valuation uh now I'm far
[17:02] from there this is the actual monthly
[17:04] recing Revenue 642 in Mr um which is not
[17:07] bad for a software that is about a month
[17:09] or two old but we're far from the 1
[17:11] million in valuation so what I did
[17:14] recently is I asked on Twitter Hey if
[17:17] you visited the site but you didn't sign
[17:18] up why and surprisingly I get so much
[17:21] good valuable information uh there was
[17:23] this one from Kites that says I'm not
[17:25] sure if it's worth the hustle to migrate
[17:28] all my data to your software and so what
[17:29] I'm doing now is I really want to focus
[17:31] on building features that help people
[17:33] grow their startup with data actionable
[17:36] data that tells you exactly how to grow
[17:38] your startup data FAS knows what your
[17:40] site is all about and it also knows
[17:42] analytics my goal now is to build the
[17:44] right features to help customers grow
[17:46] their business so the new feature I
[17:47] built recently and I'm super excited
[17:49] about is the customer Journey it
[17:52] basically gets all the customers and
[17:54] check everything they've done before
[17:55] signing up uh for this person uh tomaya
[17:58] I can can see that this person found uh
[18:00] [ __ ] fast on X I can see what the person
[18:03] did so they visited the site two time
[18:06] and then they purchased and I can look
[18:08] at for different customers for instance
[18:10] um this one I can see what they did on
[18:12] on November 1st I can see what they did
[18:14] after they even uh sent me an email and
[18:17] then finally they ended up paying this
[18:19] is just the beginning it's a very early
[18:20] version but basically is going to track
[18:22] any goal that the user has in mind until
[18:25] the entire Journey from the moment the
[18:27] person visited the site to the moment
[18:29] they completed the goal and as a little
[18:31] hint I'm going to use that later to give
[18:33] some actionable insight another things I
[18:36] did which is also really useful is when
[18:38] I get events from stripe called the web
[18:40] hook events um stripe tells me for
[18:42] instance a customer check out but fail
[18:45] or or customer just cancel their
[18:47] subscription and so I built lots of
[18:49] little robots on my site that listens
[18:51] for those events and send emails to try
[18:53] to understand why the customer performed
[18:55] this action for instance I set up this
[18:57] email here that says um I noticed you
[19:00] just cancel your data fast subscription
[19:02] so right after they cancel your feedback
[19:03] could help me improve data fast if you
[19:05] tell me just why you cancel I'm just
[19:07] curious and now I'm getting pretty
[19:09] decent replies um I think what the
[19:11] person means here is that he doesn't see
[19:13] the value in the software yet so back to
[19:15] the initial problem but uh it's good to
[19:17] collect feedback and know exactly why
[19:20] people take the time to visit my landing
