[00:03] my name is Mark and this is the story of
[00:06] how I went from living with my parents
[00:08] and $0 on my bank account to making $1
[00:10] million as a solo developer in less than
[00:13] 3 years this is a story of a regular kid
[00:16] who had no idea what to do in life I got
[00:18] addicted to video games and lost my
[00:20] self-confidence in my 20s so I needed to
[00:23] change I started building tiny internet
[00:25] businesses along the way I learned
[00:27] everything on YouTube whether it's
[00:29] marketing coding and even speaking
[00:31] English and after 27 businesses I made
[00:34] my first $1 million now seven of these
[00:37] internet businesses make $62,000 per
[00:40] month I work on any project I want I can
[00:43] move my office from Bali to France to
[00:45] Korea i surf every morning I prioritize
[00:48] my sleep I can spend time with my wife I
[00:51] have designed the life I've always
[00:53] wanted but the journey has been very
[00:55] challenging most of my businesses failed
[00:58] and I gave up multiple times and at my
[01:00] lowest point I run ads on adults website
[01:04] making $4 in two month before falling
[01:06] into depression so in this video I'm
[01:08] going to share my story transparently
[01:10] from everything I did and what I learned
[01:12] from it and I hope it inspires anyone on
[01:14] the journey so let's get
[01:16] [Music]
[01:19] started I was born in no Sur a little
[01:22] town near Paris in October 1993 I have
[01:25] two beautiful younger sisters my parents
[01:28] grew up poor but work hard to become
[01:30] engineers and this is important for the
[01:32] next part and my childhood was really
[01:34] beautiful all I remember is me in my
[01:36] bedroom building Legos all day
[01:41] long Middle School is when the trouble
[01:43] started I didn't like School the
[01:46] teachers were old and boring the topics
[01:48] were outdated we were learning old
[01:50] French used like 500 years ago and on
[01:53] top of that as students we were ranked
[01:56] against each other based on our grades
[01:58] and I never understood why two students
[01:59] be compared against each other instead
[02:02] of being just compared to themselves I
[02:04] was not interested in school so I had
[02:06] bad grades the teachers would put me at
[02:08] the back of the classroom and label me
[02:10] as the disturbing kid it almost became
[02:12] my identity now I'm 30 years old and I
[02:15] still have n Mayors about not being
[02:17] prepared for a school exam and things
[02:19] got worse at home my parents who had
[02:21] worked their way out of poverty through
[02:23] education expected me to do the same but
[02:25] I just couldn't connect so I was
[02:27] constantly fighting at school and at
[02:29] home and I felt like I was rubeling
[02:31] against everything eventually I was
[02:33] expelled from school and my parents had
[02:35] to meet with the director to get me back
[02:37] in I knew I pushed too far so I made a
[02:40] promise to my parents that I would
[02:44] graduate when I turned 18 I had to do
[02:47] something with my life but I didn't know
[02:49] what in French society there's a strong
[02:51] belief that if you don't go to
[02:53] university then you are less smart it's
[02:55] like there are two path and if you
[02:56] choose the wrong one then too late you
[02:58] miss your chance and it's fun because
[03:00] after graduating from my master's degree
[03:02] in computer science people started to
[03:04] see me as a smart engineer but I was a
[03:06] total scam I knew nothing everything I
[03:09] learned to run my businesses are
[03:11] thoughts from YouTube Google and the
[03:12] internet but I didn't know that back
[03:14] then and my parents pushed me toward
[03:16] University so in 2013 I got accepted in
[03:19] a university to do a master's degree the
[03:21] school was 2 hours away from a parents
[03:23] place in TW so I moved into my own
[03:26] little apartment I was so excited
[03:28] because For the first time in my life I
[03:30] was free but that's also when things
[03:32] became chaotic since I didn't like
[03:34] school I didn't like University either
[03:37] and now with a freedom to skip classes I
[03:39] studed to play video games all day long
[03:42] I played World of Warcraft 8 hours a day
[03:45] and by the end of the year I had spent
[03:47] 65 days in the game I also picked up a
[03:51] smoking habit and completely ignored my
[03:53] studies things got so bad after the
[03:55] first year that I was kicked out just
[03:58] like in high school my parents had to
[04:00] meet with the director to get me back in
[04:02] and I remember my mom pleading with him
[04:04] asking what are they going to do with me
[04:06] if they didn't give me another chance I
[04:08] had to promise to the university I would
[04:10] get good enough grades and once again I
[04:13] made a promise to my parents that I
[04:15] would do the minimum to graduate I got
[04:17] back on track reduced video games and I
[04:19] started dating a girl then something
[04:21] unexpected happened in 2015 my
[04:25] girlfriend got accepted for a student
[04:27] Exchange program in Hong Kong I was was
[04:29] devastated by the idea that she would
[04:31] leave me so I decided to do whatever it
[04:33] takes to follow her but my grades were
[04:35] not good enough to get into the same
[04:37] program but I found a loophole the only
[04:40] way to be in Hong Kong at the same time
[04:42] as her is to find an internship there
[04:45] there were two problems first my English
[04:48] was terrible and second I had no
[04:51] valuable skill for the job market but I
[04:54] was so afraid of losing her that I
[04:55] didn't care and that's when I made the
[04:57] first real bet on myself
[05:00] I will get that internship in Hong Kong
[05:02] no matter what to learn English I
[05:04] switched the settings on my computers
[05:06] from French to English and every single
[05:09] day I would struggle to understand what
[05:10] was going on on my interface and I also
[05:13] made a rule for myself to never Google
[05:15] anything in French anymore I can only
[05:18] use English it was 10 years ago and up
[05:20] to these days it remains one of the best
[05:22] decision I've ever taken then I needed
[05:25] the skills to apply for a job and since
[05:27] I knew nothing I had to find some
[05:29] something I could learn on the internet
[05:31] that's how I came up with the idea of
[05:33] becoming a programmer but time was
[05:35] limited and I couldn't become a software
[05:37] engineer suddenly so I went on Wikipedia
[05:39] and I googled the fundamentals concept
[05:41] of programming just so that I knew what
[05:44] it was and I send countless resum√©s and
[05:48] miraculously one of them accepted my
[05:50] application that trip in Hong Kong
[05:52] changed my life The Internship itself
[05:55] was a disaster I didn't know how to code
[05:57] they figured it out and I almost got got
[05:59] fired but living in Hong Kong opened my
[06:02] eyes to a completely new world new
[06:04] culture new food new ambition new
[06:07] mindset for the first time I realized
[06:09] that there was more to life that I could
[06:11] ever imagine I came back home
[06:13] transformed I somehow managed to
[06:16] graduate by coping on my neighbors
[06:17] during the exams so I didn't learn much
[06:20] I didn't even go to the ceremony because
[06:22] I didn't care about University but I had
[06:24] a new goal in mind I wanted something
[06:27] different
[06:31] around this time in 2016 I watched The
[06:33] Social Network the movie about how Mark
[06:35] zukerberg created Facebook that's when I
[06:38] had an epiphany I believed I will be the
[06:41] next Mark Zuckerberg I just needed a
[06:43] billion dollar idea back then I was
[06:45] climbing and I always struggle to find a
[06:47] partner that's how I come up with a new
[06:49] concept Tinder for sports lover an app
[06:52] that will match you with people with
[06:53] similar sport Hobbies I moved back to my
[06:55] parents house which was tough because I
[06:58] lost my freedom and to support that I
[07:00] found a job as a waiter for $10 an hour
[07:03] it was an interesting experience because
[07:05] I learned that if I smile which is
[07:07] something very rare for waiters in Paris
[07:09] then I would get more tips I realized
[07:11] that people don't just pay for the
[07:13] product they pay for the experience it
[07:15] was my first deep into the marketing
[07:17] World during the day I worked on
[07:19] building my mobile app the problem is
[07:21] that I had zero knowledge in coding and
[07:24] even though I had studied computer
[07:26] science it was nothing practical either
[07:29] Theory or outdated dinosaur programming
[07:31] languages I wasn't sure how to learn how
[07:33] to code properly so I just Google how to
[07:35] create a button for a mobile app I found
[07:38] this library of components called ionic
[07:41] and I felt amazing I felt like I could
[07:43] build an entire mobile app with just a
[07:45] couple hundred lines of code at least
[07:47] that's what I thought I was just reusing
[07:49] beats of code without understanding the
[07:51] fundamentals I spent an entire year
[07:53] building this app and it was a total
[07:55] disaster the more code I was adding to
[07:57] the app the buggier the app guts one day
[08:00] I talk to an entrepreneur a real
[08:02] entrepreneur who asked me how I plan to
[08:04] make money that's when everything
[08:06] collapsed and that was my first slap in
[08:08] the face I realized that my brilliant ID
[08:11] would never exist and even if it did it
[08:13] would never make money my entire world
[08:16] fell apart it was the first time for me
[08:18] to try to do something different to
[08:20] prove a point and it was going nowhere I
[08:23] felt like a failure I remember crying at
[08:25] night with my girlfriend unable to
[08:27] explain what's wrong I just felt
[08:30] miserable and I knew I needed a
[08:34] change when things started to go
[08:36] downhill a high school friend of mine
[08:39] Sasha reached out to me he was in South
[08:41] Korea and told me he could raise
[08:43] $100,000 from venture capitalist to
[08:45] start an AI startups and he wanted me on
[08:48] board with nothing going right in my
[08:50] life I accepted and I was so
[08:52] disillusioned with the past that I quit
[08:54] everything my app my girlfriend my
[08:57] family and I moved to South Korea in 200
[08:59] 17 at first things were great I finally
[09:02] found a friend who shared my ambition to
[09:04] create something we agreed that I will
[09:06] be the CTO so I bought a JavaScript
[09:09] course on UD and I started to learn
[09:11] programming from the ground up our
[09:13] startups focus on predicting the price
[09:15] of flight tickets to tell customers when
[09:17] is the best time to buy we had two
[09:19] investors and hired two employees I
[09:21] built the mobile app using react native
[09:24] and the team built the API and the
[09:25] Machine learning algorithm we had a
[09:28] great MVP to show
[09:29] but no one was interested in after a few
[09:31] months we realized that this was going
[09:33] nowhere we were both engineers at heart
[09:36] and we didn't know how to get customers
[09:38] an ambitious idea and a great product I
[09:41] was making the same mistake I did back
[09:44] in France just a year earlier so we
[09:46] decided to go our separate race in
[09:51] 2018 and here I was again alone on the
[09:55] other side of the planet with poor
[09:57] cutting skills and no idea what to do
[09:59] next so I started to question my choices
[10:02] I lost my self-confidence and started
[10:04] smoking again around the time I met a
[10:06] current girl who worked at the same
[10:08] startup centers and me we started dating
[10:11] and she became my girlfriend one day I
[10:13] saw an ad on Facebook selling couple
[10:15] gloves mittens for couples to hold their
[10:17] hands together I thought it was genous
[10:19] and perfect for the current market where
[10:22] nothing like this existed and since I
[10:23] had failed two big projects earlier I
[10:26] was excited to try something new and
[10:27] simpler my girlfriend was also also
[10:29] excited so we decided to work on the
[10:31] project together we started a small
[10:33] closing brand called Glovers gloves for
[10:36] lovers we worked with a lovely Korean
[10:38] Grandma who knitted all the 50 gloves
[10:40] for us and we did everything else from
[10:42] designing the gloves to creating the
[10:44] logo it was fun first I started selling
[10:47] the gloves on Facebook replicating the
[10:50] ad I had seen but it was a total flop my
[10:52] bank account was near zero and we had 50
[10:55] unsold glove I burned a couple hundred
[10:58] because I knew nothing about ads so we
[11:00] decided to go industry to sell them we
[11:02] managed to sell a few making my first
[11:04] dollar as an entrepreneur I was happy
[11:07] and a little proud but the lifestyle was
[11:09] pretty unhealthy we would go out late at
[11:11] night in the freezing korein witer
[11:13] getting drunk in order to stay warm
[11:16] barely making any profit so in March
[11:18] 2018 we closed down the project I had no
[11:21] income and no savings so my girlfriend
[11:23] and I moved to a $500 a month
[11:26] underground apartment in sale it was
[11:28] Tiny humid there were centipedes and
[11:31] other kinds of insects but this is all
[11:33] we could afford I found a few gigs as a
[11:35] background actor making sometimes up to
[11:38] $100 a day which helped us survive for a
[11:40] few more months I wanted to return to
[11:42] making apps and websites but I was
[11:44] frustrated with my past failures around
[11:47] that time I met a guy named Andre who
[11:49] became my friend I shared with him my
[11:51] frustration and he told me sell it
[11:54] before you build it my engineer mind
[11:57] couldn't comprehend that but he was
[11:58] smart so so I decided to give it a try
[12:00] but I had no idea what to sell so I came
[12:03] up with a universal business idea help
[12:05] businesses get more customers and since
[12:08] I loved playing games I thought that the
[12:11] product could be a gamification
[12:12] marketing tools for escap room
[12:14] businesses in other words it's a game
[12:17] that escape room businesses could give
[12:19] to their customers to entertain them
[12:21] that would promote the escap room
[12:23] business when they're done playing the
[12:25] game so that the escape room would get
[12:27] more customers I was in Japan for a Visa
[12:30] Run staying in a cheap hot and noisy
[12:33] guest house with poor Wi-Fi I was
[12:35] paralyzed with fear to have someone on
[12:38] the phone and to sell them something I
[12:40] felt like I was scamming them but I took
[12:42] the call anyway the person on the other
[12:44] side was danela escape room owner in
[12:47] Perth Australia despite my awkwardness
[12:49] and all the wrong things I say during
[12:52] this call um so um I REM um um I sent
[12:57] you um a demo of the of of she said yes
[13:01] after 40 minutes on September 8th 2018 I
[13:06] made my first dollar on the internet
[13:09] this is the money on my P PayPal
[13:14] account danela paid $300 for the setup
[13:18] and $99 a month in subscription I was so
[13:22] happy I felt like I finally made it and
[13:25] the feeling of getting money from the
[13:28] internet with just me and my computer it
[13:30] felt amazing and on a side note danela
[13:33] ended up being my customer for the next
[13:35] 5 years and spent
[13:37] $4,000 for my software and all it took
[13:40] was a single code email I still had
[13:43] mediocre coding skills but I build a
[13:45] software for her and she was happy with
[13:47] it and at the same time I bought courses
[13:49] on UD in order to improve my coding
[13:51] skills I was so excited about getting my
[13:53] first customer that I repeated the
[13:55] process called emails calls and improve
[13:58] the software and and by the end of the
[13:59] month I had closed three customers as
[14:02] the business grew my life started to get
[14:04] better I quit smoking I started working
[14:06] out again and I ate healthier food my
[14:09] girlfriend quit her job and since we had
[14:11] no reason to stay in Korea we moved to
[14:13] Bali Indonesia in the middle of 2018
[14:16] life in B was great it was cheap it was
[14:19] sunny I even learned how to surf and I
[14:21] became addicted to it I kept the same
[14:24] routine Marketing in the morning and
[14:26] coding on the afternoon the business
[14:28] grew quickly to $1,000 in monthly
[14:30] recurring revenue and picked at
[14:32] $4,000 at the end of 2019 I increased
[14:36] the price to
[14:37] $199 per month and I played around with
[14:40] annual deals for
[14:41] $2,000 yesterday I did two hours of
[14:44] marketing and today I get the payment
[14:46] from the guy from Melbourne so I get
[14:48] just earn $1,000 and here is my
[14:52] reward and I remember selling a few of
[14:55] those annual plans and it felt like I
[14:57] was a king I was so happy I was not
[14:59] broke anymore and I also felt like I had
[15:01] a purpose and then in March 2020 covid
[15:08] hits because of the lockdowns escape
[15:10] room businesses were forced to close so
[15:12] I decided to pose all the subscriptions
[15:14] and the software I built for 2 years
[15:16] went from $4,000 a month to zero in 1
[15:20] minute on top of that I was a little
[15:22] scared being in Bell not knowing what
[15:24] would happen luckily it was not bad
[15:26] there was no real lockdown so I went
[15:28] surf
[15:29] that's how I met a new friend who became
[15:32] my best friend I started making YouTube
[15:34] videos and I didn't think much about
[15:36] entrepreneurship for a little while when
[15:38] Co began to ease in August 2020 my wife
[15:41] and I went back to friend and decided to
[15:43] get married so we could stay together no
[15:44] matter what the wedding was beautiful
[15:46] and even her parents could come from
[15:48] South Korea but we couldn't come back to
[15:51] Bali because they suddenly imposed
[15:52] another lockdown so we were stuck in
[15:54] France living with my parents my
[15:56] previous software started to make money
[15:58] again around
[15:59] $15,000 per month but it was pretty slow
[16:02] and I got a little bit bored of it after
[16:04] focusing on it for 2 years so I decided
[16:06] to start something new since I had some
[16:08] customers into the escape room industry
[16:10] I decided to work for the same customers
[16:12] but build a little different product
[16:14] this time it would be a little widget
[16:16] that would sit on the customers's
[16:18] website so that their visitors could
[16:20] play a game directly onto the website
[16:22] have F get a discount coupon for The
[16:24] Escape BR business and book right away
[16:26] it was the first time for me making
[16:28] games I learned everything from YouTube
[16:30] I had so much fun and on top of that it
[16:32] was working well I beta tested with some
[16:34] of my customers and it increased their
[16:36] comption rate from 3% to
[16:39] 3.5% just with one little script I was
[16:42] really excited about the product but the
[16:44] world itself was not really in a good
[16:46] position for marketing tools especially
[16:49] not escape room businesses so the launch
[16:51] was really slow at the peak it R $300 in
[16:54] monthly recuring revenue and at the same
[16:56] time the churn for my previous software
[16:58] was growing so I decided to change
[17:01] completely and work on something else I
[17:02] was not really sure what I wanted but I
[17:04] wanted something smaller something
[17:05] simpler something that I could ship
[17:07] quickly now we are entering a weird phas
[17:09] in my life my sister who is a doctor
[17:11] explained me how the male bladder works
[17:14] and why some drops of urine could fall
[17:17] down after leaving the toilet and she
[17:18] also explained me how to fix it so I
[17:21] decided to sell this information I spent
[17:23] a couple days creating a PDF to explain
[17:25] how it works how to fix it and I build a
[17:27] website called the golden Plumber where
[17:30] you could purchase the PDF for $4 I
[17:33] printed stickers with QR code that led
[17:35] to my website and I stuck them in
[17:37] toilets all over Paris I thought it
[17:39] would be the perfect place because this
[17:40] is exactly where customers need it but
[17:42] after a few weeks and no sales I give up
[17:45] on the stickers but not on the business
[17:47] I think I needed to prove something to
[17:49] myself so I started to run ads on adult
[17:51] websites I made a little video with my
[17:54] face and started to pour money into it
[17:56] and one month later I had one C customer
[17:59] and made $4 by this time I was 27 years
[18:02] old living with my wife at my parents'
[18:04] place all of my previous projects
[18:06] miserably failed I had no savings I was
[18:09] getting out of shape the reason I left
[18:11] my home was to prove that there was an
[18:12] alternative to the current education
[18:14] system and years later I came back in
[18:17] the exact same home with nothing but
[18:20] failures I felt like a failure for weeks
[18:23] I couldn't get the thoughts out of my
[18:25] head in one random morning while making
[18:28] coffee I started to cry for no reason I
[18:31] went back to my room cried again and
[18:33] then anger started to feel inside of me
[18:35] something that I had no control over I
[18:38] started to shout and I needed to express
[18:40] this anger so I punched the wall in my
[18:42] room four times I didn't even realize
[18:44] but each punch was hurting my wrist I
[18:46] kept smashing until my parents came
[18:49] afraid and worried and had to stop me I
[18:51] spent the next hours with my mom and my
[18:53] girlfriend on the sofa trying to
[18:55] understand what happened without finding
[18:57] the answer I felt miserable and I knew I
[19:00] needed a
[19:03] change I made a big U-turn and I decided
[19:06] to do something I never thought I would
[19:08] do I took a job I wanted to become a
[19:11] software engineer mostly because it's
[19:12] remote and also because I had a little
[19:14] bit of coding knowledge that could help
[19:16] but I wasn't really a software engineer
[19:18] so at the same time I was sending
[19:20] application I was learning through
[19:21] YouTube about apis nodejs react Etc at
[19:25] first they were interested about my
[19:26] application because I had some cool
[19:28] experi experiences to share but they
[19:30] realized that I was actually not a
[19:32] proper software engineer so I got
[19:33] rejected but one of the company was
[19:35] hiring aggressively so they overlooked
[19:37] the gaps in my experience and after two
[19:39] interviews I lended the job and the
[19:42] hiring person told me that I would be
[19:44] working for Ty Lopez the famous internet
[19:47] marketer knowledge I didn't know I would
[19:49] work for him because he was not
[19:50] mentioned in the offer but I was pretty
[19:52] excited and at the same time it paid
[19:54] almost $9,000 per month an amount of
[19:56] money that I've never seen in my life
[19:58] life suddenly felt different for the
[20:01] first time in years I had a sense of
[20:03] purpose I was told what to work on and
[20:06] by the end of the day I would have
[20:08] produced something valuable for that
[20:10] person I felt worthy something that I
[20:12] haven't felt in a long time plus unlike
[20:15] entrepreneurship I didn't have to work
[20:16] all day long so I had time for me to
[20:18] read books and get back in shape I
[20:21] thought I hated reading because of
[20:22] middle school they gave us like 500
[20:24] years old books to read I couldn't
[20:27] understand a word and I didn't like it
[20:29] but since I could choose what to read I
[20:31] started to love it and it's been 3 years
[20:33] I started reading I've read around 30
[20:35] book and it has changed my life
[20:36] completely the first book I read is
[20:38] called why we sleep by Matthew Walker I
[20:41] used to set up an early morning alarm so
[20:43] I could work more and the book
[20:45] completely changed my perspective I
[20:47] started to prioritize my sleep and I
[20:49] instantly felt better less stress more
[20:52] focus and overall happier it is by far
[20:54] what impacted the most my mental and
[20:56] physical health and I'm still wondering
[20:59] why they don't teach us that in school
[21:01] instead of the Pythagorean theorem and
[21:03] since I had more time I decided to
[21:05] improve my coding skills I wasn't really
[21:07] sure why but I thought it would be great
[21:09] either if I need to find a job later or
[21:12] if I just want to build better apps so I
[21:14] bought cheap UD me course and learned
[21:16] the fundamentals again of JavaScript
[21:18] HTML CSS and react by the end of 2021
[21:21] the covid lockdown in belly had been
[21:23] lifted so my wife and I decided to
[21:25] return back home since I could work
[21:27] remotely it was not an issue but one
[21:30] week after landing in Bal I received a
[21:31] call and got fired but surprisingly I
[21:34] didn't care I discovered the social
[21:36] media Twitter because Ty Lopez was
[21:38] running polls to question his audience
[21:40] and I found a tweet from Peter levels a
[21:42] solo developer who built tiny startups
[21:45] from anywhere in the world and he built
[21:47] these startups in public sharing
[21:49] everything he does and everything he
[21:50] learns a new wave of Entrepreneurship
[21:53] less ambition that VC funded startup but
[21:55] more freedom with no employees a smaller
[21:58] project I was hooked so when I got fired
[22:01] I knew it was time for me to go back to
[22:02] entrepreneurship with a different
[22:07] strategy December 2021 $30,000 on the
[22:11] bank account back in Bal in a new dream
[22:14] I was so frustrated with the past that I
[22:15] told myself I would do things
[22:17] differently so I set five rules for
[22:19] myself rule number one I prioritize
[22:22] sleep I have seen in the past how much
[22:23] it impacts my mood and my overall
[22:25] happiness so no matter what I will
[22:27] always prioritize sleep rule number two
[22:30] I will share everything I do
[22:31] transparently on Twitter that way I
[22:33] could connect with other entrepreneurs
[22:35] and never feel lonely again rule number
[22:37] three I committed to shipping the
[22:39] smallest version of my idea no more
[22:41] spending one year in my bedroom
[22:43] overthinking a project I will show it to
[22:45] the world as fast as possible rule
[22:47] number four I promise myself I will
[22:50] always launch my project and try to show
[22:52] it as as many people as I can rule
[22:55] number five no more outcome goals but
[22:58] only process goals so instead of having
[23:01] a goal of losing weight my goal would be
[23:04] working out every single day instead of
[23:06] focusing on something I cannot control
[23:08] like how much weight I'm going to lose
[23:10] I'm going to focus on something I can
[23:12] control like how many times a day I'm
[23:14] going to work out that way I approach
[23:16] the journey as a collection of small
[23:18] projects even if my project is a total
[23:21] flop and nobody wants to use it it still
[23:23] grow my portfolio of little websites I
[23:26] started the journey by launching a
[23:27] website called mood to movie a simple
[23:29] website that would recommend movies
[23:31] based on your mood I wanted to test the
[23:33] strategy and I got lucky it went viral
[23:36] on Hacker News which bring a couple
[23:37] thousands of visitors on the site and
[23:39] also grew my Twitter following I also
[23:41] created habits Garden a gamified habit
[23:44] tricker people would set up their daily
[23:46] habits like reading books or working out
[23:49] they would get some quest to challenge
[23:51] themselves and they would get rewards
[23:52] like gems if they complete the quest
[23:55] that way they could grow a little
[23:56] digital garden and stick to to their
[23:58] daily habits people love the app and
[24:00] there was a payroll for the premium
[24:02] version and the app grew to 500 in
[24:04] monthly recuring revenue and I keep
[24:06] repeating the same process over and over
[24:09] one idea a few weeks launch it and move
[24:11] on by the end of 2022 I had built 10
[24:14] websites that way it was not making much
[24:17] money but I was having a lot of fun and
[24:18] my Twitter audience was growing there
[24:21] were some moments that were really slow
[24:23] nothing much was happening and I
[24:24] remember feeling lonely just like in the
[24:26] past and sometimes questioning my
[24:28] choices whether or not I should maybe
[24:30] take a job as a software
[24:32] engineer in 2022 my best friend passed
[24:36] away my wife and I were silent for a
[24:38] couple day trying to process the loss he
[24:40] is an amazing person and taught me that
[24:43] there is a little gem inside of everyone
[24:45] his death made me reflect on the journey
[24:47] and reminded me that the fern is in the
[24:50] process not the outcome so I kept
[24:52] shipping apps I found my first success
[24:55] with a new approach making fun videos
[24:57] skit when launching a new startup I did
[25:00] videos with Joe Rogan Leonardo DiCaprio
[25:03] Matthew mcon I even did a video playing
[25:05] World of Warcraft In Real Life as a
[25:08] little reminder for the University time
[25:10] it was unconventional but people loved
[25:12] it and that's how my Twitter audience
[25:14] went from 1,000 followers to 10,000
[25:17] followers early 2023 after about a year
[25:20] I started to run out of Muddy so I
[25:21] shifted my focus toward apps that solve
[25:24] real problems painkillers and not
[25:27] vitamins I also focused on app that have
[25:30] a payall so no more free plans and no
[25:32] more free users in 2023 I built Indie
[25:35] page a little software that lets anyone
[25:37] build a beautiful portfolio page it went
[25:40] really well and made a couple thousand
[25:42] dollar in Revenue within the first month
[25:45] which helped with my financial worries
[25:47] around that time the AI Trend was so big
[25:49] that I decided to give it a try I built
[25:52] make Ling it's a website generator
[25:54] people would input some text and it
[25:56] would output an entire website sites the
[25:58] launch went well generating an extra
[26:00] couple thousand in Revenue but I really
[26:03] didn't care about the market or the
[26:05] customers so I got bored of it at this
[26:07] point I had projects all over the place
[26:09] so I decided to sell some of them in
[26:11] order to focus I sold Mech Ling for
[26:14] 35,000 I sold habits Garden for $10,000
[26:17] and I also sold that second software I
[26:19] built for escape room backs in 2020 for
[26:23] $4,000 and he was still making $50 per
[26:25] month in monthly recurring Revenue in
[26:27] August 2023 I had built somewhere for 15
[26:30] to 16 new websites and I wanted to
[26:32] improve my strategy to ship faster so I
[26:35] created a little Cod base for myself and
[26:37] it was working so well that I decided to
[26:39] sell it I called the website cheap fast
[26:42] and I launched it a week later I told my
[26:44] wife we would be lucky if we make $100
[26:47] 24 hours later it had made
[26:50] $4,000 the biggest hit I had ever had I
[26:54] remember being in Hong Kong for a Visa
[26:55] Run sleeping in a 12 squ met bedroom
[26:58] room the airport just closed because of
[27:00] the typhoon and the building was shaking
[27:03] but I didn't care I finally had found
[27:05] product Market fit and it felt
[27:08] incredible I was so excited I couldn't
[27:10] sleep for three nights in its first
[27:12] month chifas made $50,000 in Revenue so
[27:16] I kept working on it listening to users
[27:18] adding new components opening an
[27:20] affiliate program and as I build
[27:22] everything in public sharing my Revenue
[27:23] my Twitter following also grew but I
[27:26] knew that Chief fast couldn't be 100% of
[27:28] my focus because its value came from the
[27:31] lessons I learned shipping software so I
[27:33] kept shipping a startups a month I built
[27:36] buy dispute to prevent chargebacks on
[27:38] stripe I built logo fast a free tool to
[27:41] make logos pretty quickly I built Zenvo
[27:44] a tool to generate invoices for European
[27:46] customers I focused on startups that
[27:48] solve my own problems and each of the
[27:51] project I launched made money anywhere
[27:54] from a couple hundred to a couple
[27:55] thousand per month and at the same time
[27:58] times I kept improving ship fast with my
[28:00] learnings in January 2024 I was still
[28:03] making around $50,000 per month I was
[28:05] having fun so I decided to start YouTube
[28:08] I gave myself another process goal I
[28:10] would make one video per week in less
[28:12] than 24 hours no matter what and up
[28:15] until this day I have stuck to this New
[28:17] Year resolution at first nothing
[28:19] happened for 3 months then I made a
[28:21] video showcasing the 23 websites that I
[28:23] built and YouTube decided to push my
[28:25] videos the channel Grew From almost 0
[28:28] followers at the beginning of the year
[28:29] to 990,000 people in August 2024 thank
[28:33] you so much and at the same time my Rue
[28:36] doubled and at the top in April 2024 I
[28:39] made
[28:40] $143,000 with all my projects combined
[28:43] at this point I started to have couple
[28:45] hundred of thousand dollar on my bank
[28:47] account way more money than I could ever
[28:49] imagine owning at 30 years old it
[28:52] removed all the stress of wondering how
[28:54] to pay next month rent and it made me
[28:56] feel awesome to think that I might never
[28:59] have to work for money again that brings
[29:01] me to today life is a little simpler but
[29:05] overall nothing has changed I still surf
[29:08] every morning work on my tiny businesses
[29:10] on the daytime and enjoy a good evening
[29:12] with my wife the biggest shift is my
[29:15] mindset now I am addicted to building
[29:17] startups and I can't wait for the next
[29:19] hit and right now I'm working on two big
[29:22] project that I'm about to launch and I
[29:23] am so excited I did not make this video
[29:26] to brag or to sell you a course I made
[29:28] this video because I was so frustrated
[29:30] with the education system I wish someone
[29:33] would have shown me earlier there was
[29:35] another way you shouldn't take advice
[29:37] from just anyone especially not someone
[29:39] with a mustache but if there is one
[29:41] piece of advice for you this is it
[29:43] tomorrow you'll wish you would have
[29:45] started today start now build something
[29:48] build anything as chpt or Google when
[29:51] you're stuck find a way to make it fun
[29:52] through a challenge or doing it with a
[29:54] friend each project will teach you
[29:57] something and the right project can
[29:59] change your life and that's the end of
