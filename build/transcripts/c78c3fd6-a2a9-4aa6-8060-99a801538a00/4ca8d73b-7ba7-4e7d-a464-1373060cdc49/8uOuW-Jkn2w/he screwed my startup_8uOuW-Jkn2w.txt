[00:02] this is what my current father-in-law
[00:03] told me on the day I married his
[00:05] daughter and that is what it
[00:07] [Music]
[00:24] [Applause]
[00:28] means that place that place it it needs
[00:31] a change I spent the last 900 days in
[00:34] this place at 8 hours a day how how much
[00:37] is
[00:39] that 7,200 hours in this place in this
[00:44] office and it doesn't feel like it's
[00:45] mine I want something that Sparks my
[00:47] creativity my my
[00:49] muse or maybe I'm just looking for an
[00:52] excuse to
[00:53] procrastinate first I'm going to get rid
[00:55] of that big black drawer that's full of
[00:58] junk anyway so that I can repaint the
[01:00] the entire white wall from there to
[01:02] there in the same blue color as the left
[01:04] one so that I can stick on all the
[01:06] projects I'm working on right now on the
[01:08] wall just like this that's my portfolio
[01:10] of tardos the problem is I have no clue
[01:13] how to paint my job is this and beside
[01:17] of that I have no clue how to use this
[01:18] in the real
[01:21] world FY buy P luckily I get my friend
[01:24] to help around
[01:28] [Music]
[01:32] another all right looking pretty
[01:39] good let's talk about intellectual
[01:41] property in 2023 I was working on an AI
[01:44] startup to help people learn language in
[01:46] a fun way so if you want to learn Korean
[01:49] with K-pop or if you want to learn
[01:50] French with cheese Cuisine then it will
[01:53] generate workbook so that you can
[01:55] practice with your favorite topics it
[01:57] would create a bunch of exercise like
[01:59] this one and make it inside of a
[02:01] workbook so that people can practice
[02:03] their new
[02:06] language no idea what it means the
[02:08] startup was a disaster but along the way
[02:11] I learned that I was doing the same
[02:13] thing over and over from creating Ling
[02:15] page components to authenticating users
[02:17] to sending them email which gave me a
[02:19] good idea because this AI language
[02:22] product was my 15th startups I created a
[02:24] little Cod base for myself so that I can
[02:26] ship startups faster and I turned it
[02:28] into a product so that other developers
[02:30] can use it and I call that ship fast on
[02:32] September 1st 2023 I launched ship fast
[02:35] I was hoping I could make a couple
[02:37] hundred I ended up making a couple
[02:39] hundred th000 and I was so happy it's
[02:42] the first time in 6 years one of my
[02:44] project is taking off and people are
[02:46] happy and pay for it but I wasn't
[02:47] prepared for what came next I share
[02:49] everything I do on Twitter from the apps
[02:52] I code the marketing strategies that I
[02:53] use and the revenue that I earn and
[02:56] sometimes when someone from YouTube who
[02:57] watched my latest video hacked my Ser I
[03:00] also share that when I created my
[03:01] Twitter account 3 years ago I signed up
[03:03] for transparency I'll be as authentic
[03:05] and transparent as possible so when [ __ ]
[03:08] fast took off I started to share
[03:09] publicly my revenue and lots of people
[03:11] were inspired with the revenue numbers
[03:13] but among them some of them were a
[03:14] little bit too inspired and ended up
[03:17] making questionable landing pages that
[03:19] really look like mine well let me show
[03:21] you some copycats so this is the
[03:24] homepage of my product and that is my
[03:27] headline I created it because I know EX
[03:29] exactly the pain of building a startup
[03:31] for one year and getting zero users and
[03:34] shortly after came in the copycat
[03:37] inspired websites there was this one
[03:40] with a very similar headline and it
[03:43] became pretty much the default for any
[03:45] new boilerplate product in the end there
[03:47] is only one person to blame if I didn't
[03:49] want to have any copycats maybe I
[03:51] shouldn't Brak my Revenue like this in
[03:53] public but someone went too
[03:57] far original blue
[04:00] new blo I should have known
[04:03] it at least it's
[04:22] dry casual day binging Twitter I
[04:25] received this DM from a friend and as
[04:27] I've seen many CopyCats in the past I I
[04:29] decided to not even look at the Tweet
[04:31] but then I received another DM from a
[04:33] friend with words that are uh quite
[04:37] serious a copyright compliance and going
[04:40] to Twitter I saw other messages like
[04:42] this one lawyers and blah blah blah so I
[04:45] decided to follow the link and look at
[04:47] what is actually going on and I found
[04:49] this Tweet [ __ ] fast for $200 now use
[04:52] [ __ ] fast instead does the same thing
[04:54] for a shitty S ID clone the repository
[04:57] and a link to a GitHub rep so I followed
[05:00] the link and I ended up on this GitHub
[05:02] repository which is an exact copy of my
[05:07] repository a customer of mine giving
[05:09] away the code for free to the public on
[05:13] the internet I wasn't really sure what
[05:15] to do so I asked everyone in my company
[05:18] well imitation is the sensous form of
[05:20] fluttery and the laziest form of
[05:23] competition it's time to initiate a
[05:25] comprehensive infringement litigation
[05:27] Str have you heard the latest version of
[05:29] next supports partial pre-rendering
[05:31] which combin static and dynamic Pages
[05:34] man the speed I need to upgrade but no
[05:36] one could came up with a proper answer
[05:39] so I decided to ask my
[05:46] friends some came up with questionable
[05:49] advice hi everyone this is niik for
[05:52] Indie news we are on a crime scene today
[05:55] someone just copycatted the famous
[05:57] influencer marlu to create [ __ ] fast so
[06:00] Maru is going to be bankrupt as you can
[06:03] see the cops already present here thank
[06:05] you Nico and some came up with pretty
[06:07] good advice telling me to just talk to
[06:10] him although it didn't go really far so
[06:14] I did what I usually do when I am
[06:24] stuck if you go to that link you
[06:27] actually end up on a place where you can
[06:29] get the code for free for free I mean I
[06:34] think for now it's better to focus on
[06:36] what you like to do in Korea we
[06:40] say so bad thing can be good thing and
[06:43] good thing can be bad thing we will
[06:45] never know focus on what you
[06:48] like Misfortune turns into blessing my
[06:52] wife think that should not obsess over
[06:53] these little details and I should focus
[06:55] on what brought me here as her father
[06:57] told me on the day we got married
[07:00] I think she is probably right so I have
[07:03] decided to not give a [ __ ]
[07:08] [Music]
[07:32] we are a couple days after the incident
[07:34] and the guy actually removed the
[07:36] repository so my father-in-law was
[07:38] actually right and by the way I'm trying
[07:40] to turn my boring entrepreneur life into
[07:42] a video that hopefully is not boring so
[07:44] please let me know what you think about
[07:45] it
