[00:06] [Music]
[00:15] 3 months ago I had a business IDE in
[00:17] mind and I told myself I'm going to grow
[00:18] it to $1 million no matter what so I
[00:21] locked myself in this room for 90 days
[00:23] to build the
[00:27] product this software I launched it a
[00:29] couple days ago and it's already making
[00:31] money so I'm going to show you how I
[00:33] build really fast using AI because if it
[00:35] wasn't with AI I would probably spend an
[00:37] entire year making this product I'm
[00:40] going to show you the exact Revenue
[00:41] numbers and how I'm able to always find
[00:44] business ideas that are almost
[00:45] guaranteed to make money but uh before
[00:49] we get started
[00:53] [Music]
[01:05] it's my 25th business but there is half
[01:08] of the space left on the wall so I guess
[01:10] I got to ship
[01:12] faster okay so this is the Ling page of
[01:15] my new software called Data fast it's an
[01:18] analytic tool for people who have a
[01:20] business and want to grow their business
[01:22] using data so on the learning page
[01:24] section on the hero section I show here
[01:25] a big screenshot of what the dashboard
[01:28] looks like then there is a section of
[01:29] about how simple it is to use the
[01:31] product so first you need to add a
[01:32] little script to your website then you
[01:34] can connect with your Revenue data
[01:36] provider like a strip or lemon squeezy
[01:38] and then data fast my software is going
[01:40] to show you some insights how to
[01:42] leverage more how to get more revenue
[01:44] from your traffic then there is a little
[01:46] feature sections where I highlight the
[01:48] core features uh they're web analytics
[01:50] related features so there is a playable
[01:52] video for each of them that uh goes
[01:55] deeper into each of the features of the
[01:57] product and there is one as well for the
[01:59] growth insight features then there's a
[02:01] little section about my story why did I
[02:03] build this product because I am not a VC
[02:05] company I am not a big company anyway um
[02:08] it's just me so here I show my little
[02:11] story I have also a video in the past
[02:14] three years me going over my software
[02:16] and explaining how to use it how to get
[02:18] the most out of it I feel like adding a
[02:20] little Personal Touch is very important
[02:22] for people like me who are working solo
[02:24] and uh then there's the pricing section
[02:26] so it goes from nine a month U there's a
[02:29] monthly and a yearly plan the yearly
[02:30] plan gives two month free uh it starts
[02:32] at 9 a month and the pricing is based
[02:34] per events or page views how many
[02:36] visitors the site will get and it goes
[02:38] from anywhere to from 9 to um whatever
[02:42] whatever pricing there's also a 14 days
[02:45] of free trial which normally I don't
[02:47] recommend ver but um since uh there are
[02:50] lots of comp it's actually a product
[02:52] that has lots of competitors and they're
[02:54] all doing it and since for now the
[02:56] product is too early to be so different
[02:58] so special that it's good to use other
[03:01] competitors pricing to make mine and
[03:03] then there is the fq section here where
[03:07] um you know question and answer thing
[03:08] and at last call to action so everything
[03:10] goes to this login or sign up page
[03:12] people can log in with Google and can
[03:14] log in with an email and to increase
[03:16] conversion on the left side I autoplay a
[03:18] video of the software to remind people
[03:20] why they're on this page um I'm going to
[03:22] go with Google because this is what I
[03:24] use for uh well I use the product for
[03:26] myself so this is uh how I'm going to
[03:28] log into the app when people logged into
[03:30] the app normally there is nothing here
[03:32] they will have to add their websites so
[03:35] there are three steps uh first you input
[03:37] the domain name of your site then you
[03:38] have a little script to install and
[03:40] optionally you can connect your payment
[03:42] provider um since I already have built
[03:44] other startups these are all of my
[03:46] projects the one you see on the back on
[03:48] the wall and uh it gives you a little
[03:51] glimpse of what happened in the last 24
[03:52] hours and for each s same it gives you a
[03:55] little Glimpse as well um now let's pick
[03:57] a site here for instance in page it will
[04:00] give me lots of data for the past 24
[04:02] hours or if I want for today if this
[04:04] week this month all the time it is
[04:06] really up to the person so here I have a
[04:08] little chart where I can see in blue the
[04:10] visitors per hour and the revenue per
[04:12] hour I also have some metrics like what
[04:14] is how much revenue do I get per unique
[04:16] visitor what is the conversion rate what
[04:18] is the bounce rate um how many visitors
[04:20] are on the site right now and if I
[04:22] scroll I will have a bunch of other
[04:23] information like how do people find my
[04:25] websites um you can see that a lot of
[04:27] them for the last 24 hours are coming
[04:29] from TW Twitter which Pages do they
[04:31] visit the map of my visitors as well as
[04:33] which countries and city they're from
[04:35] which brother they're using etc etc and
[04:38] in Orange here I can see this is a
[04:40] payment this means I get $90 from the
[04:43] source of Revenue and I got $45 from
[04:46] mar.com and I can also see which
[04:48] countries are bringing the most revenue
[04:50] and for this example it's the United
[04:52] States recently I shipped a new feature
[04:54] called goals where uh people can input a
[04:56] new goal like uh tracking something
[04:58] specific so for instance for this app I
[05:00] track the number of signups and the
[05:02] number of payments and then later I'm
[05:04] going to add a little funnel like a
[05:05] visual chart to uh see what is actually
[05:07] going on and then I am working on this
[05:09] new feature though this is very early um
[05:11] I'm showing this to you uh but the
[05:13] feature is not live but I guess when
[05:15] this video will be live this feature
[05:16] will be live too so here it is this is
[05:18] the customer Journey so those are three
[05:20] of my customers and then for each of
[05:22] them I can click on their profile and I
[05:24] see uh a bunch of information I see
[05:26] first where they're uh where they're
[05:28] from uh which shitty which desktop they
[05:30] using and then I see what brought them
[05:33] to buy the app so the first visit
[05:36] happened was I think it's like two weeks
[05:38] from now and how they found my website
[05:40] th through my personal website what they
[05:43] did back then and then the person didn't
[05:45] do anything and moved on and then on
[05:47] October 15th the person came again
[05:49] visited some of other person's uh page
[05:52] etc etc this user has actually been
[05:55] really busy uh Sunday 20 and then if I
[05:58] keep scrolling until till the ends um
[06:00] the final part the part that I'm
[06:02] interested in here is the payments so I
[06:04] can see the entire Journey everything
[06:06] the customer has did um that led to
[06:09] making an actual payment okay and
[06:11] finally something I built that um I used
[06:14] to collect feedback from my users in
[06:16] order to build the best hopefully the
[06:18] best analytics product out there is this
[06:20] little dashboard here this is something
[06:22] I built by myself and uh people who are
[06:24] logged into my app can suggest some
[06:27] features and upvote the one that they
[06:29] would like to see in the app the most
[06:31] and they can also have a little uh
[06:32] conversation anywhere here where they
[06:35] can leave comments if they want and what
[06:37] I do is I just use that I pick the
[06:39] feature that is the most requested and I
[06:41] build
[06:42] it okay so this is the text tag I used
[06:45] to build this product so it's a nextjs
[06:47] project everything is UN with next I
[06:49] have the API endpoint on next and I'm
[06:51] hosting everything on versal I'm using
[06:53] twin and my own ends to design
[06:55] everything I'm going to go over some
[06:56] design tips in a minute I'm using not
[06:58] Mel gun but resend to send emails I
[07:01] recently switched over to resend because
[07:04] it's easier to set up and I feel like um
[07:07] I need to send follow-up emails to my
[07:09] customers after like for instance when I
[07:10] build a product in public I need to tell
[07:12] them hey this feature is available mun
[07:14] is purely transactional emails and res
[07:16] Recon I can create audiences I can
[07:18] create a group of people to which I can
[07:20] broadcast a message which is absolutely
[07:22] useful so this is the audience for
[07:24] datafast for instance there are 676
[07:26] people in it at the moment and every
[07:28] time I build something new I easily in a
[07:31] click send them a broadcast like this
[07:33] one for instance and um I'm also using
[07:35] next oath for the authentification I
[07:37] think now it's called OJs I have to
[07:39] login log in with Google which is very
[07:40] important because people want to click
[07:42] on a button and log in instantly and as
[07:44] a backup I have a magic link feature and
[07:46] finally for the database I am using
[07:48] mongod DB some people question the
[07:50] choice for analytics I am used to
[07:52] mongodb so this is what I'm using at the
[07:54] moment for now it's it's fast enough um
[07:57] this is the cluster that I have it was
[07:59] zero gabt a few days ago and uh now it's
[08:02] already costing a decent amount of of
[08:04] money I think databases are pretty
[08:06] expensive anyway so um I guess uh that
[08:08] will be probably the highest cost uh of
[08:11] to run this business two tips one about
[08:13] design one about copyrighting I am not a
[08:16] designer but I design all of my products
[08:18] and for that I get inspired from what I
[08:20] see on the internet I pick a little bit
[08:22] of this here a little bit of that there
[08:24] and I apply everything to my product so
[08:25] for instance this is a site that I think
[08:27] is really beautiful and you can see I'm
[08:29] using the exact same orange color as
[08:31] they do I'm also reusing the this
[08:34] background color this like grayish
[08:35] background color and the length the size
[08:37] of the borders and and at the same time
[08:39] I love versal the platform where I host
[08:42] all of my project I love this design
[08:44] those like a overall design where you
[08:46] see all of your projects and I'm using
[08:48] this again to get inspired to design my
[08:50] own product now if you want to get
[08:52] better at designing and you know
[08:53] absolutely nothing I wrote a couple
[08:56] articles on my blog it's 100% free you
[08:58] can check it out it's right here
[09:00] marbi and you will see there like
[09:02] articles about how do you Endor spacing
[09:04] how do you write text how do you write
[09:06] headlines how do you choose the right
[09:08] colors for your site and now about
[09:10] copyrighting um this section the hero
[09:12] section this is what all of your
[09:14] visitors will see and this is the most
[09:16] important part of your site based on
[09:18] what people see this is the first
[09:19] impression that matters a lot this will
[09:22] dramatically impact how many people sign
[09:23] up for your products how many people
[09:24] decide to give you money so the design
[09:27] of this hero section has to be crystal
[09:29] clear super simple to read there needs
[09:31] to be a headline a little bit explainer
[09:33] on how to that actually that thing
[09:35] actually work a beautiful call to action
[09:38] and a demo of your product and what
[09:40] matters even more than the section is
[09:41] the headline itself it's very important
[09:44] to pick an headline that is not about
[09:46] your product but is about the outcome
[09:48] for the customer my product is an
[09:50] analytic tool that gives you data but
[09:53] this does not matter to customers what
[09:54] matters to them is growing a startup
[09:57] that's why in the headline in big and
[09:59] bold it says grow your startup and then
[10:02] in the section below I explained how to
[10:04] actually grow the startups so make sure
[10:06] you build your hero section about the
[10:08] outcome for your customers and not about
[10:09] your product it took me around 90 days
[10:12] to build a software and I would have
[10:13] never be able to do that without two
[10:16] main factors the first one is that I use
[10:18] AI heavily I used to use visualized
[10:21] Studio code with GitHub compilot but
[10:23] since the release of cursor AI I made
[10:25] the switch because it's so much better
[10:28] so what happens is that I use my own
[10:30] code base my own ball plate for my
[10:32] project so I start the project with an
[10:34] existing code base and then on top of
[10:37] that I add features but because I'm lazy
[10:39] um I'm a programmer after all I just
[10:42] chat with the AI and I ask the AI to add
[10:45] features for me so for instance this is
[10:47] the script that collects uh information
[10:50] that collects the page views the events
[10:52] the visitors and I wanted to add a
[10:54] feature where users of my software could
[10:56] see the viewport of their own users that
[10:59] means I need to update the script I need
[11:00] to update the even the model in the
[11:02] database I need to update the API
[11:04] endpoint that returns data I need to
[11:06] update the UI that show it to the users
[11:09] and um instead I just say that to Cloe
[11:12] Sonet and replies with all the steps all
[11:15] the things I have to do and since I know
[11:18] how the code works I just have to double
[11:20] check make sure that everything makes
[11:21] sense and then I just click apply and
[11:23] continue and I have the working code so
[11:26] now my job is not to write code is just
[11:28] to review the code that is made by the
[11:30] AI and I think the AI generate around
[11:32] 80% of all the code another part that's
[11:35] very very important is that I ship the
[11:38] minimal version of my app I believe
[11:40] every startups has a 24 hours version if
[11:43] we take the big famous startups Airbnb
[11:46] could be a Google spreadsheet if we take
[11:48] Instagram it could be a public Google
[11:50] Drive and if we take magdonal it could
[11:51] be just a popup store I always start
[11:53] with the 24 hours version of my startup
[11:56] if I had to launch tonight what would my
[11:58] startup look looks like and from that
[12:00] version I build just the minimum amount
[12:02] of features I need in order to show it
[12:04] to customers and this is very important
[12:08] because by shipping the startup I get
[12:10] real feedback from The Real World not my
[12:12] own thoughts created features but real
[12:15] features like things that people need
[12:17] sometimes I ship something people don't
[12:18] care sometimes people tell me something
[12:20] and I'm like oh that could be a feature
[12:22] and then it's actually a feature that
[12:23] people love using that's why it's very
[12:25] important to go to market as fast as
[12:27] possible actually I only spend 3 months
[12:29] on the product because it's my MVP this
[12:31] time usually it's about a week this time
[12:33] it took 3 months but the final version I
[12:36] have four data fast for this software
[12:38] it's much bigger than that but I had to
[12:40] ship as soon as I can because now it's
[12:42] in the hand of users and they give me
[12:45] the right feedback I need to build a
[12:46] proper
[12:48] product now let's talk about numbers I
[12:51] launched the startup a couple days ago
[12:53] maybe 20 days ago I think with one tweet
[12:56] and only one tweet I posted that the
[12:58] Tweet went pretty pretty well 700 likes
[13:00] which brought a decent number of
[13:02] visitors the fact that I have an
[13:04] audience really helps but you will see
[13:06] in a minute that it does not change
[13:07] anything to the fact that you can make
[13:09] lots of money even though you're just
[13:11] getting started so now looking at the
[13:12] numbers I'm using well data fast to
[13:14] track the metrics on data fast so in
[13:17] total there we go we have the date here
[13:19] on the 1st October I launched and it has
[13:21] got around 30,000 visitors um it's
[13:24] mostly coming from that tweet and you
[13:26] know like retweets Etc as well as a few
[13:29] people trying to hack my system all the
[13:31] time that obviously brings a lot of
[13:33] visitors on the site as well which is
[13:34] not the kind of traffic I want to have
[13:36] anyway um so you can see here most
[13:37] traffic is actually coming from Twitter
[13:39] and a little bit from other platforms as
[13:41] well uh the traffic mostly coming from
[13:43] United States India and Europe now let's
[13:45] look at stripe and the numbers okay this
[13:47] is for today so $18 for today in total
[13:50] uh in the last 20 days it made $600 um
[13:53] there were in the last 20 days since I
[13:55] launched there 14 days of free trial so
[13:58] there are 14 days where there was Zero
[14:00] revenue for 14 days so this is basically
[14:02] $600 in the past um I don't I would say
[14:05] like a week or something the monthly
[14:07] recuring revenue is at 353 it's slowly
[14:10] growing but it's pretty slow but I'm
[14:12] very happy nonetheless um it's
[14:13] interesting to see that it's half of the
[14:16] gross volume which means that lots of
[14:18] people go for the yearly plan uh which I
[14:21] guess it's a good thing means that they
[14:23] trust the product enough so that they
[14:25] are willing to pay for an entire year in
[14:27] exchange of two month for free um
[14:28] there's one thing that's really wrong
[14:30] here is the turn rate which is 8 28%
[14:33] which is a lot like really a lot earlier
[14:35] I just said that having an adance does
[14:36] not matter let me show you this guy Jack
[14:39] freaks he's been my friend we've been
[14:40] chat we've never met each other in real
[14:42] life but uh we've been chatting on
[14:43] Twitter for a little long time now he
[14:45] has made this tweet around the same time
[14:48] I launched my software uh it's a very
[14:50] simple tweet he just saying what he's
[14:52] working on and he showed a demo of his
[14:55] software the twin went viral like crazy
[14:57] viral and he DM me and he's already at
[15:01] like this is a screenshot that gets a
[15:02] couple days old now I think he's at 600
[15:05] in monthly recording Rue so he has
[15:07] double of my monthly recing Revenue even
[15:09] though the guy has 88,200 followers
[15:12] which is great but nothing compared to
[15:14] my 13,000 followers and the guy is
[15:16] making double the money that I make with
[15:19] my new software so here it's very
[15:20] important because having followers being
[15:22] lucky having money to spend on ads can
[15:25] help a little bit but the things that
[15:27] matters the most is that you build a
[15:30] good product that solves a real problem
[15:33] and now let's go over that part
[15:36] specifically I found two ways to create
[15:39] startups that will make money the first
[15:41] one and my favorite one by far is to
[15:43] scratch your own itches if you have a
[15:46] problem and you are able to fix it with
[15:49] a solution a product that you create
[15:51] someone else might have the same problem
[15:53] as you for instance this is my personal
[15:55] website and people kept saying like oh
[15:57] it's a it's a beautiful website I wish I
[15:58] could create create the same so um I
[16:00] just built IND the page a little
[16:01] software where uh people can you know
[16:04] create the same website as I just did
[16:06] kind of like a link in BIO tool and then
[16:08] because I have launched all of those
[16:10] startups I realized I was doing the same
[16:11] thing over and over so I created this
[16:13] little codebase Boer plate for
[16:15] developers so I can ship my startups
[16:17] faster I'm scratching my own itches and
[16:20] we if we go back to Jack freaks the guy
[16:22] I just showed you earlier this man has
[16:24] been posting on Instagram every single
[16:26] day for like I don't know 200 days or
[16:28] maybe even more than that that and he's
[16:29] also posting on Twitter Tik Tok Etc
[16:31] every day he has to open those four
[16:33] platforms and he has to post upload a
[16:36] video to each of them it's annoying it's
[16:37] painful so he has just scratched his own
[16:40] itch and he created this product here
[16:42] where he can just upload one video and
[16:44] he's going to automatically post on
[16:45] Twitter Youtube Tik Tok and Instagram
[16:47] he's scratching his own itches and this
[16:50] is how he's making a product that makes
[16:51] money now sometimes you don't have any
[16:53] problem in your life or you just don't
[16:55] see it in that case you can use the
[16:57] second strategy which is stop looking
[16:59] for ideas and just use something that is
[17:01] already working so find a market you
[17:03] care about some people or group of
[17:05] people that you have some kind of
[17:07] interest and then copy a product that
[17:09] people are already paying for add your
[17:11] own signature make it cheaper make it
[17:13] more expensive make it better makeing it
[17:15] more beautiful more easy to use this is
[17:16] up to you but make it yours this is
[17:18] another easy way to make money because
[17:20] you know people are already paying for a
[17:22] solution to a real problem so here's an
[17:24] example this website here is how I made
[17:27] my first dollar on the internet I love
[17:29] games so I wanted to work with escape
[17:31] room businesses and just like any other
[17:33] business businesses need to get more
[17:35] customers so if I make a game that helps
[17:37] Escape rooms get more customers then
[17:40] they will pay for it if I ask them to
[17:41] give me $1 and I give them back $2 they
[17:44] will definitely pay for it this is what
[17:45] happens if you look at now the business
[17:47] is over because I I stopped working on
[17:49] it I moved on to something else but if
[17:51] you look at it this is the business
[17:52] starting in 2018 and it has made around
[17:56] $70,000 just with a simple simple simple
[17:59] simple idea I knew businesses will pay
[18:01] to get more customers and now there are
[18:03] tons of other businesses that you could
[18:05] replicate for instance if you took the
[18:06] famous um Kenly the software to book
[18:10] calls um you can make your own version
[18:13] specifically for I don't know
[18:14] veterinarians doctors uh whatever
[18:17] whatever this is you know like maybe a
[18:19] segment of Market that you know better
[18:20] than others and you can make a product
[18:22] tailored for them at the same time you
[18:25] could also think about like these
[18:27] subscription that everybody ate I hate
[18:29] paying monthly subscriptions maybe there
[18:31] is a calendly version where you only pay
[18:33] like I don't know
[18:34] $99 and never again and then you access
[18:37] the software unlimited you can compete
[18:38] with the pricing you can compete because
[18:40] you choose the right Market segment you
[18:42] can compete because you make a better
[18:43] product there tons of way to compete now
[18:46] for the new software I just created this
[18:48] is a mix of those two it's first
[18:50] scratching my own itches because I've
[18:52] always wanted to have web analytics
[18:54] combined with Revenue data as well as
[18:57] the typical web analytics people are
[18:58] already paying to know what's going on
[19:01] on their website so I know I couldn't go
[19:03] really wrong and then you just have to
[19:04] do the work share it with the world
[19:06] remember this guy he just made a very
[19:08] simple tweet that went viral everybody
[19:11] has a chance if you show up on social
[19:13] media if you share transparently what
[19:15] you're working on you will get your
[19:17] chance my challenge with data fast is to
[19:20] reach $1 million in valuation that means
[19:23] $25,000 in monthly recurring revenue and
[19:25] I will never get there with the actual
[19:27] version of the product I will never
[19:29] actually get there by adding features I
[19:31] will get there with the right marketing
[19:34] angle to explaining you what is
[19:36] marketing angle let's go back to my
[19:38] codebase ship vest in about a year this
[19:41] project made a million dollars in
[19:43] Revenue I don't think there is any other
[19:45] codebase for developer that had reach
[19:47] this amount and the reason is is because
[19:50] I used a marketing angle that was
[19:52] untouched so far every great codebase
[19:55] you could see out there were marketed
[19:56] for the features build this there is
[19:58] that feature there is this feature for
[20:00]  fast I took an entirely new
[20:02] approach this is the headline and this
[20:04] is an emotional headline I'm not talking
[20:07] about the features I'm talking about the
[20:08] benefit for customers we developers
[20:10] always overthink when making products we
[20:13] over engineer everything I know that
[20:15] because I have been there myself that's
[20:17] why I have branded I have marketed chip
[20:19] fast as the structure that developers
[20:21] need in order to stop overthinking and
[20:24] finally ship that side project and it's
[20:26] because of the right marketing angle
[20:28] that I became a millionaire with a
[20:30] GitHub repository now I want you closing
[20:33] this YouTube tab open your code editor
[20:36] build something and share it with the
[20:38] world and until the next video I hope
[20:40] you just ship it
