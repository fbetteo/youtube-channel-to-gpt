[00:00] you are a software engineer you are
[00:01] going to cringe at the next part I do
[00:03] not use typescript I do not use G
[00:05] branches I do not test my code and I
[00:07] keep the same text tack for the past 2
[00:10] years I still use mongodb and I love it
[00:12] this is usually a loss of time because
[00:13] it creates constraints and whenever you
[00:16] want to move fast and break things it
[00:18] just make everything much slower
