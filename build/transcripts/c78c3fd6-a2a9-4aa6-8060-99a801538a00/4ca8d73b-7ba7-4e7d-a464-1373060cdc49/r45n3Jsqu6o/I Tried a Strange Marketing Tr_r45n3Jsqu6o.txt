[00:00] So, this is the dumbest marketing
[00:02] experiment I've tried. This is my
[00:04] t-shirt. On the back, there is a cure
[00:06] code. When people scan it, they go to my
[00:08] website and if they buy my product, I
[00:10] make money. Well, that's the perfect
[00:12] plan. So, I just wore this t-shirt and
[00:14] travel the world. I wore it in the busy
[00:15] streets of Mumbai. I wore it in shopping
[00:17] malls in Singapore in the plane. People
[00:19] stared, people laugh. One guy took a
[00:22] selfie with me and run away. At some
[00:23] point, I just became a walking ad and
[00:25] the sidewalk was my funnel. The real
[00:27] question is, can this dumb ideal
[00:29] actually make money? First, I had to
[00:31] pick the right product. I have built
[00:33] over 30 businesses. Some are SAS, some
[00:35] are marketplaces, and some were built
[00:37] during a personal crisis. But most of
[00:38] them don't make money. So, I picked
[00:40] Codefast, my course that teaches people
[00:42] how to learn how to code. Because it has
[00:44] lots of positive reviews, because it
[00:46] converts well, and because it has a
[00:48] broad audience. A random tourist in
[00:49] Paris is more likely to want to learn
[00:51] how to code than reduce Stripe
[00:53] chargebacks. Then, I had to create the
[00:54] cure code. I made a link that points to
[00:56] my course with a little tracking tag at
[00:58] the end. That way, I could use datafast
[01:00] to see exactly who scanned it, how long
[01:02] they stayed, and if they actually bought
[01:04] my course. Datafast is like Google
[01:05] Analytics except that it doesn't require
[01:07] a PhD to understand. I added some text
[01:09] to the cure code because when you tell
[01:11] people not to do something, they usually
[01:13] do it. And then I slap the image on a
[01:14] custom t-shirt. In Indonesia, it only
[01:16] costs $10 to create those custom shirts,
[01:19] but I made a mistake and I just ordered
[01:20] one. At this point, I had the product, I
[01:22] had the funnel, I just had to do
[01:24] marketing. So, I went to Singapore. I
[01:26] walked through a mall, train station. I
[01:28] even went to the Apple store because if
[01:29] someone spent $3,000 on the laptop, they
[01:31] might as well spend $200 for a course.
[01:33] And nothing happened. Not a single
[01:36] visitor. Maybe scanning a stranger's
[01:38] back is not a thing after all. So, I
[01:40] went to India. Totally different vibes.
[01:42] People were curious, friendly. Some even
[01:44] asked for selfies. I walked through
[01:45] Lindmark, food markets, pack street, and
[01:48] people scanned. A lot of people scanned.
[01:50] And that's when I realized two things.
[01:51] Number one, I should have printed more
[01:53] than one t-shirt, especially in a
[01:55] tropical weather of Mumbai. And number
[01:56] two, the funnel was broken. I wasn't a
[01:59] guy promoting a product anymore. I had
[02:00] become an ad that does not convert. I
[02:03] had to increase the conversion rate. So,
[02:04] I snapped a photo of me, removed the
[02:06] background, and with a little bit of
[02:08] code, I added a pop-up to the site only
[02:10] for people who scan with a cure code.
[02:11] The idea was to make people feel like
[02:13] this page was built just for them. I
[02:15] hope this would change that. So I flew
[02:17] to
[02:19] France, walked 20,000 step, got many
[02:22] people scanning me and still no sales.
[02:24] If you want people's attention, pay for
[02:26] it. So I decided to run ads, my kind of
[02:29] ads. I would give people $1 so they can
[02:31] scan my back and I would pitch my
[02:32] product. I made a cardboard and traded
[02:34] my bills for coins. I carried everything
[02:36] to the EFL Tower and it felt awkward.
[02:39] People stared, but no one scanned.
[02:40] probably because scam me really looks
[02:42] like scam me or probably because my
[02:44] shirt says the exact opposite of what
[02:46] the cardboard says. So I started talking
[02:48] first, waving the coin and smiling and
[02:51] suddenly people started scanning and for
[02:52] $1, I got to pitch my product. I talked
[02:54] to tourists, families and even a smart
[02:56] kid with this moment and most of them
[02:57] were German. I have no idea why and I
[02:59] watch it happen on real time on data
[03:01] fast. People scanning me and lighting up
[03:03] the globe. After two hours, I gave away
[03:05] all my coins and then suddenly where
[03:08] someone what the here yolo yolo I saw
[03:11] one sale
[03:13] $299. Yes, I did it. But then I
[03:16] remembered I tweeted a photo of myself
[03:19] at the EFL Tower earlier that day and
[03:21] the person bought under a company name.
[03:23] So I had no way to trace back to a
[03:25] person I talked to. It could have been
[03:27] Twitter and not the street. Suddenly I
[03:29] felt like the whole challenge was
[03:30] broken. In the taxi to go back home, I
[03:32] had mixed feelings. The driver noticed
[03:34] the cardboards in my hand and asked what
[03:36] we were doing in Paris. We chatted for a
[03:38] bit, and when we arrived home, he asked
[03:39] if he could check the course. He scanned
[03:41] my bag, read the landing page, pulled
[03:43] his credit card, and right in front of
[03:44] me, he bought it.
[03:48] He's from Benin, Africa. He drives a
[03:50] taxi in Paris, where running a pork farm
[03:52] back home, and he wants to build a
[03:53] website to sell the meat online. That
[03:56] was the moment. I thought that tweet
[03:58] ruined everything, but I wasted weeks on
[04:00] a challenge that would never work. But
[04:01] the taxi made it real again. Don't wait
[04:03] for everything to be perfect. Just put
[04:05] your work out there. It might be
[04:07] awkward. It might flop. And then out of
[04:09] nowhere, it might just work.
