[00:00] so a random guy hacked my site and he
[00:02] let me know by email I sent him $300 to
[00:04] thank him
[00:08] but not a good looking day
[00:12] today well so we missed the flight it's
[00:15] [Music]
[00:17] real I don't even know where to
[00:25] starts happy birthday to you happy I
[00:30] have all the the zinc on my face oh
[00:35] man this is the most Bell F French belly
[00:39] gift you could ever make Blow the candle
[00:41] and make a wishes what is your wish I
[00:44] think I just wish us good health and
[00:47] peacefulness I'm a you like a lion after
[00:51] eating laa
[01:02] it's a voice
[01:05] like happy birthday to
[01:27] you Surfer surfing h
[01:37] I am so excited because my portfolio of
[01:39] software is about to reach $10,000 per
[01:42] month so that include all the little
[01:44] startups here except chipas which is not
[01:46] a software and I'm so happy because uh I
[01:49] I'm doing it breaking the two
[01:50] fundamental rules of Entrepreneurship
[01:53] the first one is about Focus you can
[01:55] hear everywhere that entrepreneurship is
[01:56] about focus focus focus it just doesn't
[01:58] work like this for me in my brain I like
[02:00] to jump between different kinds of
[02:02] projects startup a on Monday startup B
[02:04] on Tuesday that just something that I
[02:06] really like and the good part about it
[02:08] is that I don't I cannot I cannot be a
[02:10] perfectionist I cannot focus on tiny
[02:12] little details I have to go straight to
[02:14] the essential because my time is limited
[02:16] and that forces me to build only what
[02:18] matters for customers which I think is a
[02:20] great framework for being productive and
[02:22] at the same time I'm also very happy
[02:24] because um this portfolio is about to
[02:26] make $10,000 and 90% is coming from one
[02:29] time pay payments except data fast which
[02:31] is brand new and also habit Garden which
[02:33] is my first startup the rest is coming
[02:36] from onetime payment so 90% of the 10K
[02:39] per month is coming from onetime
[02:40] payments one of the most common advice
[02:42] you hear out there is to have a
[02:44] subscription for your software I wrote
[02:45] and news later explaining why onetime
[02:49] payment is much better especially when
[02:51] you're getting started um you will see
[02:53] that you can actually make more money
[02:54] with one time payment because it's
[02:56] easier to sell uh it's free it's on
[02:58] internet if you want add a link in into
[03:00] the description I really recommend you
[03:01] to have a look and if you want to dive
[03:03] deeper into pricing because pricing is
[03:05] marketing and pricing is very important
[03:07] I made a video recently about five
[03:10] pricing mistakes I made it's on my
[03:12] YouTube check it
[03:14] out it's not a good looking day today
[03:18] why uh I think I got um so I'm getting
[03:22] at the moment I'm getting roasted on
[03:24] Twitter and look at that those are all
[03:26] all people trying credit card on my
[03:27] sites so they can screw whatever they
[03:30] can screw and for another business of
[03:32] mine just people just vote the app and
[03:34] then they start to dispute the payments
[03:37] it has 0.3% dispute activity there was
[03:41] like since this account exists there's
[03:43] been no dispute for a
[03:49] year she I don't even know where to
[03:51] starts so um haven't been working much
[03:54] on the product recently because um there
[03:57] hundreds of people thousands of people
[03:59] trying to attack my site my emails are
[04:01] full of spam my phone is full of
[04:04] messages from my good friends that ask
[04:06] if I'm okay I don't even know if I'm
[04:07] fuing
[04:11] okay and I just I just want to make
[04:14] startups on the internet God damn it
[04:16] okay so just a little bit of context two
[04:18] years ago I had Zer so I just focused on
[04:21] shipping really fast making apps really
[04:23] fast so I can get results fast I was
[04:25] just literally focusing on not being
[04:27] broke and then um that's that's that's
[04:29] how I ended up making all those websites
[04:31] here in the past two or 3 years and
[04:33] that's also how one of my startups took
[04:35] off so this here this thing here um is
[04:38] how I made more money than I thought I
[04:39] would ever make and at the same time I
[04:41] started to grow a following on Twitter
[04:43] and my audience went from zero followers
[04:45] 3 years ago to uh whatever this is now
[04:48] as well as growing a little following on
[04:50] YouTube and in my head I was still
[04:51] thinking like the same Mark I was 2
[04:54] years ago where I was in stress mode and
[04:55] I had to ship really fast and so I did
[04:57] not change my behavior I kept shipping
[04:59] the same way I used to and then someday
[05:01] I saw this post on Twitter from Matt
[05:05] where he says that we should write test
[05:07] for our Co we should build uh secure
[05:10] apps and um he found a way to bypass the
[05:13] pay wall on one of my startup the post
[05:15] was made in the building public
[05:17] Community which which is a community of
[05:19] um this is the community I grew up with
[05:21] like a three years ago um some people
[05:23] there became my friends like real
[05:25] friends we see in real life and it's
[05:28] it's a beautiful Community because
[05:29] entrepreneur is really hard and this is
[05:30] a place where we help each other and
[05:32] usually when one of us makes a mistake
[05:34] we would send a DM privately to each
[05:36] other and try to fix it and when I saw
[05:38] this was made um it was nicely made it
[05:40] was ethical M did Mt did not disclose
[05:43] anything here but the fact that it was
[05:45] public I didn't know how to react
[05:47] because I thought just a DM could have
[05:49] done the same work without the harm so
[05:51] at this moment I just did not reply and
[05:53] then a couple days weeks later um Matt
[05:56] found another bug in one of my products
[05:58] and at the same time I I received this
[06:00] email from a student called Jonas and he
[06:02] found the exact same bug but the
[06:04] difference is that Jonas sent me this
[06:06] bug report through a private email and
[06:09] to thank him for uh the time he took to
[06:11] write the email I sent him $300 and I I
[06:15] wanted to show that uh there might be
[06:17] another way to report bugs and if it's
[06:20] done privately I'm even happy to pay the
[06:22] people who report the bugs so I made a
[06:25] tweet taking about the story so he
[06:27] hacked my site and I paid him $300 and
[06:29] then I talk about the story of you know
[06:32] everything that that happened and I
[06:33] think um I try to have like a little
[06:35] nudge in the end to praise in public and
[06:38] criticize in private uh these tweets
[06:40] went pretty viral and I think that was
[06:43] the the start of uh something bigger it
[06:46] really created a movement where on one
[06:48] side you would have people who have the
[06:50] same mindset as me that think bug should
[06:51] be reporting in private and on the other
[06:53] side um there were developers who think
[06:56] um apps should be shipped with more
[06:58] secure infrastructure and since the
[07:00] Twitter algorithm is always made for a
[07:02] good drama they started to be like a
[07:04] flood of post of people who disagreed on
[07:07] which what is the right way to do things
[07:09] and very soon I would see lots of post
[07:11] on my Newsfeed like dozens of post a day
[07:14] of people trying to find vulnerabilities
[07:16] on my site and posting uh ethically
[07:18] again uh what they found without
[07:21] disclosing how to reproduce but they
[07:22] would post publicly what happened in
[07:25] that Community those spot was usually
[07:27] got viral and I would get I would see
[07:29] like
[07:30] in in a very quick way I would see like
[07:31] hundreds of post in a similar fashion
[07:34] and since it became big like I I would
[07:36] receive like hundreds of of people
[07:39] trying to hack my site to find something
[07:41] to share on Twitter um then my server
[07:43] will go down or we'll just find lots of
[07:45] bug like robots I think it spreaded
[07:47] outside of our community and some people
[07:50] with bad intention from outside the
[07:52] community started to join this and try
[07:54] to hack my site but like in a in a in a
[07:56] filthy way and it would go as far as
[07:58] paying for app and instantly charging
[08:01] back pretending they didn't pay in order
[08:03] for uh well me to lose money and I think
[08:05] to prove a point and at this moment I
[08:07] was I was honest I felt attacked I
[08:10] really felt attacked um so I made a post
[08:12] which I think put it more oil on the
[08:14] fire and I also posted this uh this line
[08:17] here which I'm mindly proud of uh but I
[08:21] I got emotional so I started to block
[08:24] people on Twitter um I've never blocked
[08:26] anyone in 3 years I'm usually the
[08:28] labrador type of personality
[08:30] uh but I felt like it was too much for
[08:32] me to handle and I wanted to just close
[08:34] the computer and and not see that
[08:36] anymore but this didn't help in any way
[08:39] and he just added more oil on the fire
[08:41] so it would be more people trying to
[08:42] hike my site more people posting
[08:44] vulnerabilities on Twitter and and it
[08:46] was not easing the thing so I decided to
[08:48] cool down um turn off my brain and of
[08:50] course this did not make things better
[08:52] attacks keep going stronger and stronger
[08:55] and so at some point as I just made a
[08:57] video to explain the situation and
[08:58] apologize for my emotional reaction so
[09:01] this was an intense week but also a full
[09:04] of learnings and knowledge so there are
[09:06] two things I learned the first one is
[09:08] that shipping fast is important but
[09:10] shipping fast does not mean shipping
[09:12] irresponsibly especially now that I have
[09:15] the following so my my uh apps get way
[09:17] more users and more awareness in
[09:19] security is important leaking data or
[09:22] critical bugs are just not okay and I'm
[09:25] very grateful for all the people who
[09:26] reported these bugs so I taken all the
[09:28] tweets and I went through the code base
[09:30] of all of my startups to make sure that
[09:32] this never happens again and I also
[09:34] hired someone to help me secure all my
[09:37] ads and my second learning is more about
[09:40] communication where I could have avoided
[09:43] the situation if when I saw the first
[09:45] tweet I would have just replied
[09:47] neutrally to it I should have never
[09:48] reacted emotionally I should have never
[09:50] blocked people I should have used the
[09:52] feedback in order to improve my product
[09:54] I should have opened the conversation
[09:55] and I'm very grateful for the burg
[09:57] reports good morning
[09:59] we just woke up and three more people to
[10:02] go wow it's such a big deal it's crazy
[10:07] how do you feel you honestly it feels
[10:09] unreal because I've never intended to
[10:12] grow an audience on YouTube it's mostly
[10:14] just me sharing what I do M and honestly
[10:17] he really feels unreal so if you have
[10:20] someone who just start YouTube what
[10:22] would be the advice for someone who just
[10:24] start to find the identity and I think
[10:27] in the end is about trying to try to
[10:29] make try to make stuff not for YouTube
[10:32] but try to make stuff that inspire
[10:33] people just stuff that if it's not
[10:36] YouTube if it's not Twitter if it's not
[10:37] Instagram you could show that to someone
[10:39] in the street you'll be like well that's
[10:41] cool and because I have all my eight
[10:44] businesses to run Twitter and and a
[10:46] bunch of other stuff I cannot spend much
[10:48] time on YouTube literally I spend
[10:51] maximum one day per week on YouTube so
[10:54] how did limitation help you actually
[10:56] it's because I was limited that I I got
[10:59] here it's like it forced me in 24 hours
[11:01] to do something like this this little
[11:03] constraint like you have a 24 hours
[11:05] window do whatever but you have to show
[11:07] something in the end so the the the
[11:08] audio quality was bad the video quality
[11:10] was bad like everything was bad but I
[11:11] built the habit and then nothing
[11:13] happened for 3 months literally nothing
[11:15] and then I remember I made one of those
[11:16] video that took off like YouTube decided
[11:18] to push it and some of my previous
[11:20] videos were pushed as well like I think
[11:22] two or three of my other previous videos
[11:23] were pushed as well and within a month I
[11:26] would go from a TH or like I don't know
[11:28] yeah a th000 or maybe 5,000 to like
[11:31] 15,000 like it would like triple or or
[11:33] 10x or something I don't remember
[11:35] exactly but like
[11:36] boom one more person I think one thing
[11:39] that really helped see the outcome of
[11:41] your work as a collection of something
[11:42] not as the result don't see don't don't
[11:45] look at the number of followers don't
[11:46] look at the money just look at how many
[11:48] you've done if you make 30 videos and no
[11:51] one watched them you've made 30 videos
[11:54] this is 30 videos like I made 24 25 27
[11:57] maybe now websites maybe they're on only
[11:59] eight that makes money maybe only one
[12:01] really makes money but still I made 27
[12:04] websites it's me it's like it's my
[12:06] little collection right I'm so proud
[12:08] this will never go away it's like it's
[12:09] new identity it's now it's deep in my
[12:11] DNA it will never run away oh Noone
[12:15] subcribe oh no this this is literally
[12:18] What It Takes I skipped the surf session
[12:21] this morning because I want to see this
[12:23] and I cannot start a day without surfing
[12:25] so this is extremely extremely important
[12:27] this is a gift from my sister and her
[12:30] boyfriend it says 100K followers like
[12:33] this
[12:35] one it
[12:38] happened it's real it's real
[12:44] yes I guess it's time to thank you for
[12:47] watching my videos I I you know you
[12:49] never I'm talking to a camera at the
[12:51] moment it doesn't feel like it's a
[12:53] person but there's hundred thousands of
[12:55] you who enjoyed at some point my videos

[13:56] flight we applied for a new Visa we're
[13:58] still waiting you're stay waiting
[14:00] looking at flights and and it's crazy

[14:07] we could get there a
[14:10] [Music]
