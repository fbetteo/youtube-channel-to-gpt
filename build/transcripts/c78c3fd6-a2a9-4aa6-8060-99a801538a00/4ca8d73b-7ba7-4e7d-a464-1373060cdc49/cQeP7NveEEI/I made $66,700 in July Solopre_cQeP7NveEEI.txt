[00:01] what
[00:04] I what
[00:09] I there there are three things I like in
[00:12] this
[00:13] world right it's time to get out of
[00:19] here I made
[00:22] $667 in July 20124 and I was on holiday
[00:25] for 2 weeks in this longer format Vlog
[00:28] I'm sharing everything I did in July as
[00:30] a solo entrepreneur who is not ambitious
[00:32] and build 24 tiny startups but first I I
[00:35] need
[00:36] to holidays are great but I need to go
[00:38] back to the
[00:41] office in case it wasn't obvious that
[00:43] I'm
[00:44] French
[00:46] Fu don't [ __ ] now look what I'm stuck
[00:50] with don't care if I'm in the
[00:54] room on July 3rd I did a podcast with
[00:57] stter story it's a big YouTube channel
[01:00] that tells successful entrepreneurs
[01:01] stories and how they got started the
[01:03] founder Pat walls is awesome we had a
[01:05] great time and if the interview is
[01:07] available I'll add the link in the
[01:08] description and it's crazy to think that
[01:10] two years ago I was a random guy in my
[01:12] room well I I still I still am but now I
[01:15] end up on like those podcast where I get
[01:17] a chance to tell my story those same
[01:19] podcast that I used to listen to get
[01:21] inspired and get motivated and all it
[01:23] took was building the right startup and
[01:25] since startup story is based in the US
[01:27] and I live in valy they send someone
[01:29] like a professional with videography guy
[01:31] who came to my house to show that
[01:33] interview and uh and that guy become the
[01:35] person who is editing those videos
[01:39] hey y I'm out here on the road you can
[01:43] hear little
[01:45] voice still
[01:46] get
[01:49] look the money speaking for itself I
[01:52] call it Fortune ta five top from a that
[01:55] work at corporate sales chinchilla youan
[01:57] we skiing out in Cor chel break the news
[02:00] they try to kill him but the boy
[02:04] prevails everybody's sleeping out there
[02:07] and uh I found my little office uh joke
[02:10] aside the entire EV crew is so friendly
[02:13] they just set up the entire space for me
[02:15] and everybody was so up to it all right
[02:18] so in November 2022 I built gamify list
[02:22] it's a little directory of gamified apps
[02:25] it has around 600 apps that help people
[02:28] achieve their goals using gamification
[02:31] and I built it just because first it's
[02:33] fun and second because I also owned a
[02:35] habit tracker that's gamified and I
[02:37] wanted to build like some kind of like
[02:39] side project to promote my habit tracker
[02:43] and the directory of gamification apps
[02:45] is the perfect place to do that but it
[02:46] appear there's some turbulences it's a
[02:50] it's a moving shaking office back then I
[02:52] had zero clue about SE and Google
[02:55] started to index and rank some of those
[02:57] pages and fast forward to today there is
[03:00] a constant growth in terms of impression
[03:02] and clicks and it brings around 100
[03:04] clicks per day and somewhere in July I
[03:06] saw this app called Pokémon sleep it's
[03:09] making 100 million in profit per year
[03:12] it's and it's just an app that lets you
[03:14] grow Pokémons if you sleep well and I
[03:17] love the app that's why I added it to my
[03:19] repository this month if you've been
[03:21] watching my previous videos I'm looking
[03:22] for some kind of software where I can
[03:24] spend my entire day adding features and
[03:27] I hope to bring that software to a
[03:28] million dooll valuation I already have
[03:30] the idea in mind and I cannot reveal
[03:32] exactly what it's going to do cuz I get
[03:33] a bunch of copycats but I already have
[03:35] an idea in mind that I've already
[03:37] started building and earlier this month
[03:39] I run a design bounty on Twitter because
[03:42] I was struggling with uh a specific part
[03:44] of the UI for that application a design
[03:47] Bounty it's basically an open contest
[03:49] where uh every designer can submit their
[03:51] creation and the winner receiv some kind
[03:53] of financial reward was the first time
[03:55] for me to do that on Twitter and um I
[03:57] found a design that I really liked so
[03:59] now I'm just coding that software and I
[04:01] think I should be able to launch a first
[04:04] version by the end of the next month one
[04:07] of the biggest struggle and the biggest
[04:09] shift for July was uh my YouTube channel
[04:12] if you've watched some others of my
[04:13] videos you'll see that in July I've made
[04:16] a big change in terms of how I tell the
[04:18] stories I'm not sitting at my desk
[04:20] anymore I'm traveling I'm doing some
[04:22] workouts I'm wrapping those business
[04:24] encoding stories around like lifestyle
[04:27] stories just like this Vlog and um I'm
[04:30] having three times more fun shooting
[04:32] those videos and YouTube is giving three
[04:34] times less impression it's not that I'm
[04:36] doing those for the numbers but it's
[04:37] somehow what keeps me motivated to make
[04:39] those videos and at the same time i'
[04:41] like to have an impact so if you think
[04:42] is pushing my videos to more people then
[04:44] that just makes me happy and so I'm
[04:46] trying to find a good mix of what's
[04:48] valuable and what's fun my channel went
[04:51] from 5,000 to somewhere around 70,000
[04:54] subscriber in the span of like 2 to 3
[04:56] month and it was mostly because of three
[04:58] videos how many website I made my text
[05:01] Tack and how fast I launched assess
[05:03] these are great videos I enjoyed doing
[05:06] them but the problem is that I cannot
[05:08] replicate that all the time so I can
[05:10] milk the entire story over and over but
[05:13] you deserve much better than that and
[05:15] it's kind of boring to be honest that's
[05:17] why I'm trying to round those business
[05:18] story inside of a lifestyle Vlog so it's
[05:21] kind of fun new and different but
[05:23] YouTube is a mirror of what people think
[05:26] and since it's not giving much
[05:27] impression I also kind of assume that
[05:29] it's a little bit boring and this is
[05:31] pretty much where I am stuck at the
[05:33] moment I don't know if I should follow
[05:34] the number and keep doing the same
[05:36] videos that worked well on my channel so
[05:38] far or if I should just follow my
[05:40] instinct have fun and make more of those
[05:42] videos and I also shipped a new feature
[05:44] for my software called Indie page it's a
[05:46] Linkin bio for entrepreneurs customers
[05:48] can add their startups and connect with
[05:50] their payment provider so that they get
[05:52] a public page with a verified revenue
[05:55] and a few months ago I added a little
[05:57] board where those startups are ranked
[05:59] based on on the revenue in the last 30
[06:01] days and I wanted to go a little further
[06:02] so I created a Twitter bot that every
[06:05] week shares the leaderboard for the past
[06:07] 7even days it also tag the person and on
[06:10] top of that it tweets three times per
[06:12] day when a maker is receiving a payment
[06:15] so if you want your daily dose of
[06:17] motivation I would add a link of the
[06:19] Twitter bot in the description it's the
[06:20] craziest setup I've ever I've ever done
[06:22] I think
[06:30] [Music]
[06:36] [Music]
[06:48] 2 hours transit in Tye
[06:53] [Music]
[06:59] there are three things I like in this
[07:01] world building startups surfing and
[07:03] skating in the airport my penny board
[07:05] not to loaded
[07:09] okay
[07:12] got
[07:14] toas I'm baby Chas too [ __ ] me so all
[07:22] right let's talk about Revenue all right
[07:25] so this is the revenue breakdown for all
[07:27] of my tiny project for the month of of
[07:29] July 2024 and the revenue is down around
[07:32] 24% compared to June 2024 and it was
[07:36] kind of expected because I was off on a
[07:37] holiday for 2 weeks I was actually a
[07:39] little surprised he didn't drop more
[07:41] than that because I was well I was
[07:42] completely off for half of the month
[07:44] which shows that I probably don't
[07:46] understand much in business yet talking
[07:47] about holidays oh the bur
[07:52] paining to you
[07:53] [Music]
[07:56] heart this is my little YouTube Studio
[07:59] for the next couple of second because my
[08:01] front neighbor think I'm doing something
[08:03] illegal by whispering to this microphone
[08:05] all right so talking about holidays I
[08:07] went back to my hometown in France for 3
[08:09] weeks I usually never take time off
[08:10] because I love building stuff but that
[08:12] make a little exception for Summertime
[08:14] with my entire family we went to the
[08:16] south of France and we did some surfing
[08:18] cycling and hiking and this is usually
[08:20] how I get good startups IDE when my
[08:22] brand is rested that's exactly how I
[08:24] came up with my startup that's bringing
[08:25] the most Revenue then I went back to
[08:27] Paris I didn't see the Olympics but it
[08:29] was a fun exotic Vibe because all the
[08:31] Parisian were gone and only tourists
[08:33] were in Paris all right it's time to get
[08:34] out of here before the cabin crew opens
[08:36] the door ran
[08:37] [Music]
[08:39] little
[08:40] [Music]
[08:47] [Music]
[08:51] home just Landing in bing all right the
[08:54] final updates for this month is that
[08:56] they added a tiny feature to Zenvo it's
[08:58] a tour to over customers to pay the 4%
[09:01] fee to generate stripe invoices and as
[09:03] I'm getting more customers I'm also
[09:05] getting more feedback and one of them
[09:06] was to add the name of the vat next to
[09:09] the rate of the vat for instance in
[09:11] France we have to add vat next to the
[09:13] percentage the more customers I gets the
[09:15] more I realize that the entire invoicing
[09:18] system is very complex especially in
[09:20] Europe where each country has
[09:21] specifications and if I want to make
[09:23] this invoices compliant in most
[09:24] countries I need to cover lots of use
[09:26] cases and my my code is starting to look
[09:29] very um well I I had to recreate my
[09:32] entire invoicing object based on where I
[09:35] get the data from stripe whether it's a
[09:36] checkout or whether it's payment intent
[09:39] there are so many use cases that I'm I'm
[09:41] getting around a thousand lines of code
[09:43] just to create an invoice financially
[09:46] wise it does not make sense for me to
[09:48] invest my time on this startup but I
[09:50] still do it because a that's how I save
[09:52] money on the stri fees because I use my
[09:54] own products two because I'm also
[09:56] learning a lot about the entire
[09:57] invoicing system which is pretty complex
[09:59] and interesting and three because maybe
[10:02] by getting customer feedback I'll land
[10:04] on some kind of a new feature or a new
[10:06] product that can be an entire startup
[10:07] that makes way more
[10:19] money I am a big fan of Brian Johnson
[10:23] the the vampire guy
[10:25] [Music]
[10:31] I uh I invested a little bit of my
[10:33] profit into health I like Brian I like
[10:36] his Spite and I like how ComEd he is
[10:38] he's using his own product and it kind
[10:40] of remind me of what I do with with my
[10:41] own little startups on a much much
[10:43] smaller scale though and now that I'm
[10:46] back in belly I I really need to do
[10:48] [Music]
[10:51] that back to the office
