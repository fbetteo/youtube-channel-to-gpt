[00:08] this is going to
[00:11] happen hey it's Mark and welcome back
[00:13] for this video I'm starting this new
[00:15] series where I will make a short video
[00:17] about everything that happens in my life
[00:19] as a solo entrepreneur I go over things
[00:22] that I built like softwares and products
[00:23] I'll over marketing things that I tried
[00:25] that worked and didn't the revenue that
[00:27] I earned and everything else like if I
[00:29] travel or nice books that I read
[00:31] workouts stuff that I learned I'll try
[00:33] to share everything and be as
[00:35] transparent as possible so I will share
[00:37] the good parts but also the parts I
[00:39] struggle with so if you like this Ser
[00:40] please let me know so I do it more oh
[00:42] and also here is my story really quick I
[00:44] got fired 2.5 years ago as a software
[00:47] engineer and I discovered at the
[00:48] community of developers building tiny
[00:50] startups in public on Twitter meaning
[00:52] that solo developers a q Andi who have
[00:54] no ambition to build a unicorn to raise
[00:56] money for VC or even to have any
[00:58] employee just building their tiny little
[01:00] product and I fell in love with the
[01:02] mindsets so I started to build my own
[01:04] project and today 2.5 years later I have
[01:07] grown a little audience of 880,000
[01:09] people on Twitter where I also met a
[01:11] bunch of friends there this is actually
[01:13] the t-shirt from one of my Twitter
[01:15] friends I also built 21 projects and
[01:18] currently I have 10 stream of income and
[01:20] in average my salary is around $50,000
[01:23] per month so I'm going to share
[01:24] everything that happens in the month of
[01:26] March let's go all right so now let's
[01:28] talk about work I created a new very
[01:30] tiny software called popup the idea is
[01:33] to increase the website conversion rate
[01:35] by displaying popup notifications it's
[01:37] almost started as a joke the inspiration
[01:40] came from another product of mine called
[01:41] Zenvo one of my friend actually the
[01:43] friend that gave me the T-shirt Dan told
[01:45] me to make it a product and there it was
[01:47] I spent 3 days building it I used AI
[01:50] heavily in order to build a software
[01:51] I'll share a link somewhere here where
[01:53] you can see the video on how I built the
[01:55] product really fast and I launched it
[01:57] without any expectation and 24 hours
[01:59] later it made $1,000 and about 2 weeks
[02:03] later it was at $25,000 in Revenue it's
[02:06] almost pure profit so it was overall
[02:08] pretty nice a very interesting
[02:09] experience and it also gets results for
[02:11] people I've seen a lot of customers
[02:13] coming back to me that says they love
[02:14] the product and it's working well for
[02:16] them so tiny experiments that turn out
[02:18] to be a good thing all right and so far
[02:20] the product that brings the most Revenue
[02:21] to my income is ship fast it's a b plate
[02:24] for developers to ship startups faster
[02:26] and I got a testimonal from a customer
[02:28] who made 2.6 th000 Us in 9 days and this
[02:32] is probably the biggest testimonial like
[02:34] Revenue Wise from a customers that
[02:36] shares the revenue publicly just as a
[02:38] comparison this took me years to reach
[02:40] that point I was stuck at $1,000 per
[02:42] month for so long so big kudos to him I
[02:45] also shipped a new component for the Vol
[02:47] plate called with without it's tiny
[02:49] component that people would typically
[02:51] use under the hero section of their
[02:53] website to show what it is to live
[02:56] without the product they're selling and
[02:57] to live with it it's like basically a
[02:59] before after and this is also really
[03:01] good to improve website conversion rate
[03:03] and I usually get inspiration from all
[03:05] the other products that I make in order
[03:06] to get inspiration for ship fast
[03:09] components so I know what's working and
[03:10] what's not working I also added a new
[03:12] feature for Zenvo my little software for
[03:14] stripe users to generate invoices for
[03:16] their customers without paying the
[03:18] stripe fee now it displays the stripe
[03:21] account name when the email is being
[03:23] sent about two months ago I did a little
[03:26] experiment with AI and SEO so I have a
[03:29] product called logo fast which is a free
[03:31] logo maker it has a little bit of AI in
[03:33] it where if you want a logo for your
[03:35] business you could describe your
[03:36] business ID the AI will reply with the
[03:40] icon that would fit and the colors that
[03:42] would fit and it will suggest you three
[03:44] logos when the user clicks on one of the
[03:46] three suggestions it will save the logo
[03:48] in a database and my server will create
[03:51] an HTML page optimized for Google in
[03:53] order to rank and a few weeks ago Google
[03:56] started to rank all those pages so I
[03:58] have generated now almost 3,000 logos so
[04:01] I have 3,000 pages that are now indexed
[04:03] by Google and I hope that these pages
[04:06] will rank hopefully if it happens it
[04:08] should happen within 3 to 6 months I
[04:10] will definitely report uh the
[04:12] experiments but I think it's pretty fun
[04:13] to see how AI plus a little bit of a
[04:16] human touch could create those valuable
[04:19] HTML pages that could potentially rank
[04:20] on Google I have 21 products and seven
[04:23] are making money and so I sometimes get
[04:25] drowned into data which app should I
[04:28] focus on where should I spend my time
[04:29] and attention and I found a new metric
[04:33] that really helps me to decide which is
[04:36] worth my time it's the kpi is the
[04:38] revenue generated per unique visitor so
[04:41] if a product gets 1,000 unique visitors
[04:43] and generate $1,000 this is a $1 per
[04:47] unique visitor as a matter of comparison
[04:49] my best product ship fast gets 93 cents
[04:52] per visitor and my worst conversion
[04:55] product is by dispute which gets 06 Cent
[04:59] per visitor it's very simplified you
[05:01] know there are opportunities for some
[05:03] mistakes in there but overall I found it
[05:05] really helpful and very clear on where
[05:08] to put my attention on I also did a
[05:10] podcast with Arvid KH he's like the
[05:13] father of solo entrepreneur is a really
[05:16] nice person I will link to the podcast
[05:17] somewhere in here if you want to listen
[05:19] to it we go over the addiction of
[05:21] building apps and all those kind of
[05:23] things filed startups in the past and I
[05:25] would drive my mind crazy I would spend
[05:27] a year building a product that nobody
[05:28] would ever want and finally the probably
[05:31] the biggest highlight of the month
[05:33] work-wise was YouTube I have been making
[05:35] one video per week every week since
[05:38] January this year and my channel was
[05:40] around 5 to 6,000 followers most of the
[05:43] people were probably watching from my
[05:45] audience on Twitter nothing was really
[05:47] happening and suddenly YouTube decided
[05:49] to take one of my video and pop it up
[05:51] and it's crazy in 6 days my channel went
[05:53] from 8,000 followers to 15,000 followers
[05:57] which is absolutely crazy to me my
[05:59] channel was already monetized but it was
[06:01] making $2 to $3 per day which is not
[06:03] crazy and now it's making about 40 to
[06:06] $50 per day which is here in B it's like
[06:10] a living this could pay the bills so
[06:12] this is overall absolutely crazy it's
[06:15] also the first time for me to Outsource
[06:17] a task I do everything solo from product
[06:20] building to marketing to customer
[06:21] support to legal things and I hired
[06:23] someone to make those videos so uh let
[06:25] me know what you think about them all
[06:26] right now a little health update I
[06:29] search every day about 2 hours and 6
[06:31] months ago I hurt my back I have some
[06:33] back pain in the bottom and one of my
[06:35] friends actually the same friend who the
[06:37] same friend who gave me the t-shirt and
[06:39] who told me to create the poop up
[06:41] startup gave me a pull-up bar and so I
[06:44] do pull-up and chinups every day and
[06:46] also bar hang to flatten my back and
[06:48] this is actually really helpful it has
[06:50] eased the pain to a point where I almost
[06:52] don't feel it anymore and my wife and I
[06:54] are trying a new experiment where we do
[06:56] not eat any food after 5:00 p.m. and go
[06:59] to bed at 10: p.m. and this is working
[07:02] really well we've tried this for the
[07:03] past 10 days and we have a very good
[07:05] restorative slip I also bought a ring
[07:08] the aura ring sleep tracker a couple
[07:11] months ago and I got rid of it it was
[07:13] nice but I felt anxious about getting
[07:15] the perfect sleep score and ironically
[07:17] it would trick me and make me anxious
[07:19] about it and get a worse sleep so I got
[07:21] rid of it and my sleep is better okay
[07:23] now little life update I was reading the
[07:25] book called same as ever by Morgan howel
[07:29] it's it's a book about things that never
[07:31] change in the world it is a really good
[07:33] book for anyone whether you are
[07:34] Developer entrepreneur whatever this is
[07:36] a book that will teach you how the brain
[07:38] works it's a lot of psychology it helps
[07:41] understand how people behave it's very
[07:42] interesting my wife and I also went to
[07:44] Taiwan for 2 weeks we would break our
[07:47] home routine every month or two and go
[07:50] to a different country in Asia we love
[07:52] Taiwan we have a new routine there
[07:54] you're a star you're Hollywood
[07:58] famous
[08:00] so we would wake up around 6:00 a.m. and
[08:03] then we would go straight to a workout
[08:05] after drinking a coffee we always work
[08:07] out together so it's easier to find the
[08:10] motivation to get things done then we
[08:11] would do a little stretch have a healthy
[08:14] breakfast together around 7:30 8:00 a.m.
[08:17] and then we would both go on our
[08:18] computers and work for 4 hours straight
[08:21] where we stay offline so no Twitter no
[08:23] emails just basically most of the time
[08:26] coding or making those videos writing my
[08:28] newsletter but like pure 4 hours of
[08:30] focus then we'll close the computer for
[08:32] the day and we rent a scooter and we
[08:35] would just go around places and wherever
[08:37] this is we're boring tourists we don't
[08:39] do any specific places we want to visit
[08:42] we just get lost with the scooter or by
[08:45] walking and uh this is pretty uh good
[08:48] fit for us we usually finish the day
[08:50] with a 1 hour to 30 minutes
[08:54] walk you got a new
[08:58] friend what
[09:02] and then we come back home take a shower
[09:04] and sometimes watch a movie and go to
[09:06] bed and start the exact same day the day
[09:08] after and in Taiwan we also met a friend
[09:10] from Twitter and I love the fact that
[09:12] now we can find connection Interest
[09:14] online and then meet in real life now
[09:16] let's talk about Revenue I made
[09:28] $83,200 I've been sharing my revenue on
[09:30] Twitter for the past 2.5 years and this
[09:33] is my Revenue in March 2023 back then I
[09:36] made 1,000 us from my product and this
[09:38] month I earned 833 times my salary back
[09:41] then that's absolutely crazy I guess
[09:43] that's why entrepreneurship is so
[09:45] addictive and probably the power of
[09:47] showing up every day now let's break
[09:48] down the revenue for these startups
[09:49] first the most important one that brings
[09:52] the most revenue is ship fast the
[09:53] revenue almost double this month making
[09:55] about
[09:56] $75,000 in the last 30 days this is my
[09:59] Tri dashboard but I also collect payment
[10:01] from other sources like PayPal I guess
[10:02] the revenue double because YouTube
[10:04] picked up my video and decided to put it
[10:06] on the homage so that increase the
[10:08] number of visitors and eventually the
[10:10] revenue and the revenue for my other
[10:12] products like any page or by dispute is
[10:14] pretty steady I barely don't do any
[10:15] marketing for them so I don't expect it
[10:17] to change much I'm happy the way it is
[10:19] because it's solving my own itches and I
[10:22] just like it this way my YouTube channel
[10:23] got monetized back in February this year
[10:25] back then I made $50 and this month It
[10:28] Grow significantly we're sitting now at
[10:30] about $800 for this month and this is
[10:33] pretty nice I would literally pay for my
[10:35] villa here in Valley okay so that was
[10:36] for the money in now let's talk about
[10:38] the money out for business expenses I
[10:40] spend about $4,000 a month for
[10:43] everything plus 3.5% goes to stripe to
[10:47] process payments there is about $300
[10:50] that goes for the tech stack so my
[10:51] newsletter affiliate program servers
[10:53] database and all that $700 goes to
[10:56] affiliate people who like my product and
[10:58] Market them in exchange of a commission
[11:00] I also spent about $1,000 in ads I'm not
[11:04] very good with ads a friend of mine Nico
[11:06] is helping me with it and usually
[11:08] $11,000 in would bring $2 to $3,000 out
[11:12] and I also spent about $2,000 to
[11:14] Outsource a few tasks like the video
[11:16] editing right now I also lost one income
[11:18] stream it's viral but it's a little
[11:20] software that I created back in 2018
[11:23] when I started my first solo prer
[11:25] project the wrong way everything was
[11:28] tough back then I stopped I abandoned
[11:29] the product in 2020 and it kept making
[11:31] money until this month where the last
[11:34] customer turned it was a 200 bucks per
[11:36] month subscription so yeah that hurts
[11:40] it's the end of a passive income era and
[11:42] it was a good time and for personal
[11:44] expenses my wife and I rent this place
[11:47] for about $800 per month and we spend I
[11:50] think in total about $2,000 for basic
[11:53] stuff like food we don't like buying
[11:55] physical stuff uh we sometimes go to a
[11:57] good restaurants but we barely don't
[11:58] spend anything I think my most addictive
[12:01] thing is coding apps and luckily that is
[12:03] free all right and just one more thing
[12:05] my YouTube channel recently popped up
[12:06] and if you look at my previous videos it
[12:08] looks like I am doing some kind of
[12:09] overnight success making 50,000 bucks a
[12:12] month I want you to know that it took
[12:14] 2.5 Years starting from zero to get here
[12:16] I have been struggling a lot finding
[12:18] motivation to get things done and
[12:20] sometimes even questioning my entire
[12:22] work thinking that it's absolutely
[12:24] useless and if you actually dig deeper
[12:26] in my story you will see that I have
[12:27] been in the game for about six years not
[12:30] very seriously at the beginning but I've
[12:31] tried a bunch of stuff felt a lot of
[12:33] stuff really a lot of stuff yeah this is
[12:35] not an overnight success but I hope this
[12:37] shows you that if you stick to something
[12:39] and you show up daily then you would get
[12:41] good results all right that was it if
[12:43] you enjoyed the video please subscribe
[12:44] to the channel That would really means a
[12:45] lot all right cheers
