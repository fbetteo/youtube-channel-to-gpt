[00:00] my wife is still sleeping it's almost 5
[00:04] a.m. but I cannot sleep because today is
[00:07] a big
[00:10] day but let's talk about that later
[00:14] let's go to the beach
[00:15] first hey you don't watch that watch
[00:20] this time to
[00:23] [Music]
[00:26] Surf I love B the wings are so so good I
[00:30] have to work out every day but since the
[00:33] waves are so good I never have to go to
[00:35] the gy
[00:39] [Music]
[01:01] oh my
[01:10] God two boards two weeks at this point I
[01:14] might have to get a real job
[01:16] soon all right so this is yesterday
[01:19] night and that is today
[01:33] 100,000 followers on Twitter this is
[01:36] insane in this video I want to explain
[01:39] why it was the best decision of my of my
[01:42] life to uh try to build a little
[01:44] audience on the internet and how it
[01:45] change
[01:48] everything this is me thinking that I am
[01:51] the next Mark
[01:53] zenberu dollar ID and after one year it
[01:56] failed completely zero users zero doar
[01:58] of Revenue generation I failed multiple
[02:00] project and I always run into the two
[02:02] same issues first one is that I couldn't
[02:05] get anyone to use my app see if that
[02:06] spent month working on something and
[02:08] that nobody even cares what's the point
[02:10] I didn't have money to run ads and I
[02:12] don't even know how to run ads anyway I
[02:14] didn't want to raise money from VC
[02:15] because I want to work solo with my
[02:17] computer and second I felt so lonely no
[02:20] one in my family is an entrepreneur no
[02:22] one in my friends back then was an
[02:23] entrepreneur so I started with zero
[02:25] knowledge I didn't learn anything from
[02:27] anyone I didn't know anyone I could ask
[02:29] proper questions and so in 2021 I burned
[02:31] out after failing for so many years I
[02:34] was so angry at myself for being a
[02:36] failure that I punched the walls in my
[02:37] room and I decided to quit
[02:38] entrepreneurship and get a job as a
[02:40] software engineer while I was working
[02:42] for a guy that you probably know Ty
[02:44] Lopez knowledge who was not working from
[02:47] his garage anymore back then I
[02:49] discovered cryptocurrencies and I had to
[02:51] go on Twitter to retweet some stuff
[02:53] about nft and for the first time in my
[02:54] life I opened the application Twitter
[02:56] and I was like what if you know I'm just
[02:57] curious and I go over the news feed and
[02:59] I remember seeing a tweet from someone
[03:01] that changed my life I don't know who
[03:02] wrote that tweet but it was something
[03:03] along those lines I am a developer I
[03:05] work solo I travel the world and I make
[03:07] this amount of
[03:08] money I got fired a few months later but
[03:11] it did not matter because this tweet
[03:13] changed my mind and it made me want to
[03:15] go for this new generation of
[03:17] entrepreneurs so I restarted the journey
[03:19] with a totally different mindset I will
[03:21] share everything I built publicly on
[03:23] Twitter and I will try to connect with
[03:24] other entrepreneurs I showed up every
[03:27] single day and 8 months later nothing
[03:30] happened I was writing every day about
[03:32] the things that I was building or the
[03:34] things I was learning but no one really
[03:36] cared it was one two sometimes three
[03:38] likes and most of the time it was
[03:40] actually mine but it didn't matter
[03:42] because in those eight month I made a
[03:44] couple of friends five to 10 people who
[03:46] were doing the same thing as me and I
[03:48] know over the shoulders they were
[03:50] looking at what I was doing and that was
[03:52] just enough to keep me motivated because
[03:55] I couldn't just bust nothing so I had a
[03:57] reason to wake up and work on something
[03:58] that I would share with them it took 8
[04:01] month to get 1,000 followers and then it
[04:03] took another 8 month to go from 1,000 to
[04:06] 10,000 and and finally took a year to go
[04:09] from 10,000 to 100,000 but it didn't
[04:13] matter because I was not focusing on
[04:14] numbers instead I was focusing on
[04:16] building cool stuff I was learning a lot
[04:19] building my own little portfolio and
[04:21] refining my signature until one day
[04:24] everything clicked so now I build a
[04:26] relationship with my audience they trust
[04:28] me with their attention so I'm pretty
[04:30] guaranteed that whenever I launch a new
[04:31] product I'll get a couple thousands of
[04:33] visitors so I never have to start again
[04:35] from zero at the beginning I would have
[04:37] to work this much to get these results
[04:39] and now with an audience it's the exact
[04:42] opposite and on top of that I got
[04:44] connected with amazing people people
[04:46] that I I never thought would ever talk
[04:47] to me I got the guy the podcast my first
[04:50] million that I watch every week in my
[04:51] DMs
[04:52] and Noah Kagan I did a podcast with him
[04:56] the CEO of absum $100 million a year and
[04:59] he's here wanted to make a podcast with
[05:01] me that's just crazy and if there is one
[05:04] thing I regret is to not have started
[05:08] earlier okay enough of me bragging now
[05:10] let me show you some guys who are doing
[05:12] it right and I think are going to
[05:13] explode soon okay first we have Anthony
[05:18] re Anthony reer anony he is a software
[05:22] developer and he's making the software

[05:30] really cool features and he's changing
[05:31] the life of its users and at the same
