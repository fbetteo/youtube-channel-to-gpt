[00:00] To make $1 million in profit, you need
[00:02] $1.2 million in revenue with the digital
[00:05] product. And you need 20 million in
[00:08] revenue with the restaurant. This is
[00:09] where I'm going to lock in gym code. Gym
[00:12] code
[00:14] review. We should have used typescript.
[00:17] There has never been a better time in
[00:19] history to build digital products. Let's
[00:21] shoot. This ad is so good. Time for
[00:24] serious business. What if I die? Just
[00:25] shoot it.
[00:27] Meet Mark Lou, a millionaire who owns
[00:30] exactly zero pairs of shoes and way more
[00:33] startups than you'd think is reasonable.
[00:35] He sits here in this disgustingly
[00:38] beautiful tropical paradise to show you
[00:40] how to turn ideas into brands, strangers
[00:43] into clients, and your boring job into a
[00:46] distant memory.
[00:51] 5 4 3 2 1. So, we're on the way to the
[00:55] next Airbnb and we're sad to leave
[00:58] especially. Yeah, it was such a
[00:59] beautiful place. Oh, wow. The bridge is
[01:11] built. That's unreal color.
[01:15] Which direction are we going? Are we
[01:16] going this way or or that way? I'm I'm
[01:19] not so sure which way we're going.
[01:25] Baboo.
[01:26] [Music]
[01:29] So healthy. We bought the salmon from
[01:32] the mom cook. 500 g. Lots of protein.
[01:35] Feels so muscle.
[01:40] [Music]
[01:52] All right, so we just landed in a new
[01:54] place in New Zealand. We're lost in the
[01:56] middle of absolutely nowhere, which I
[01:59] guess is good because there's no other
[02:00] distraction than this as I have a brand
[02:03] new feature I need to ship for data
[02:05] fast. So I guess this is where I'm going
[02:06] to lock in gym code gym code
[02:14] repeat. So this is what we're going to
[02:16] do. You're the coach today. There's no
[02:17] surf in New Zealand where we are. So,
[02:19] this is the first time doing a crossfit
[02:20] session with a
[02:29] wife. Go.
[02:33] There's no legacy if I drop this. Oh,
[02:35] no.
[02:36] [Music]
[02:41] Oh, it's hard. It's just a momentum and
[02:43] skill. Yeah, I didn't get it.
[02:49] Time to code.
[02:57] We are going to take a killer thumbnail
[02:59] for the New Zealand vlog and we are
[03:02] going to move this swing to the middle
[03:05] of the road. It's not a bad office. I
[03:07] just wish I could see something on my
[03:08] screen. I'm going to get cancelled.
[03:13] Okay, look at that. Wow. 200 g grass-fed
[03:18] beef from New Zealand.
[03:21] They have the best life until they got
[03:24] eaten by him.
[03:26] So good.
[03:28] [Music]
[03:30] Oh, we catch this little bird. She came
[03:33] through the window. It's like a little
[03:35] indie hiker just starting the journey
[03:37] and we want to wish him good luck. Just
[03:38] ship it. Ah, she stays here. Maybe she
[03:42] loved us. Bye-bye, pretty bird.
[03:47] It's 1000 p.m. There's absolutely no one
[03:50] around and we can see all the stars. It
[03:52] is so
[03:56] beautiful. Time to go to
[04:08] bed. Good morning. It is Sunday morning
[04:11] and there's nothing I like better than a
[04:13] coffee and a book. This is what I am
[04:15] reading at the moment. The breakthrough
[04:17] experience. Usually I have this approach
[04:19] for hopefully almost everything where
[04:21] it's either a hell yeah or no. So if I
[04:24] uh really like the book then I'm going
[04:26] to keep reading. If it's meh then I'm
[04:28] just going to go for another book. This
[04:30] one I don't know. I still really don't
[04:32] know. But at the same time I'm like just
[04:35] keep digging. I guess if it makes it in
[04:37] another video then it's probably a hell
[04:39] yeah
[04:40] book. Good [ __ ] Good [ __ ] Good [ __ ]
[04:46] [Applause]
[04:49] [Music]
[04:51] Breakfast time. The point when you move
[04:53] airplanes too often you find so much
[04:56] time opening 2 hours straight.
[04:58] [Music]
[05:00] You're dirty.
[05:04] Daily workout with the wife. Let's go.
[05:06] Do you think anyone?
[05:10] [Music]
[05:19] [Music]
[05:20] 30 minutes of workout per day, 30
[05:22] minutes of coding, 30 minutes of
[05:24] marketing. Do this every single day of
[05:26] the year in 2025 will be freaking
[05:28] amazing.
[05:36] New Zealand is so beautiful.
[05:43] [Music]
[05:47] A man, this ad is so it's so good. I was
[05:51] bored today and I didn't want to code.
[05:53] So instead, I made an ad and I used AI
[05:55] for that. So here's the thing. A couple
[05:57] days ago, I saw this ad on Instagram.
[06:00] Like literally, it was in my feed. It's
[06:01] a it's a French dude who is promoting
[06:03] his restaurants and I was like, "This is
[06:05] a really good ad." And it's also
[06:07] extremely simple to make. You just need
[06:09] an iPhone to record that. And so I try
[06:11] to make the same thing for my ad. Let me
[06:13] show you what I come up with. People
[06:14] always ask me, "Hey Jordan, how do you
[06:16] invest your money?" I don't know. My
[06:19] name is not even Jordan, it's Mark. But
[06:21] what I know is this. The best investment
[06:23] you can make is learn how to code and
[06:25] build your own tiny internet business.
[06:27] And now with AI, it's easier than ever.
[06:29] So check out codefast.no and start
[06:31] coding today.
[06:33] This literally took 45 minutes to make
[06:36] because I already know like this ad
[06:38] format works. It's a very simple script.
[06:39] I use AI to rewrite the initial script.
[06:43] So I I took the script from that
[06:44] Instagram ad. I put it to AI. I describe
[06:46] the product I'm selling. And then I
[06:48] asked the AI to keep the same short
[06:50] format and write it for my own product.
[06:52] Then I asked my wife to shoot me and do
[06:54] my weird stuff. And I use this little u
[06:56] website here um Sub Magic. You just
[06:59] upload your video and then they add
[07:01] those uh like sexy thumbnails onto your
[07:03] video which make it more dynamic. I
[07:05] think this is for Instagram so it needs
[07:07] to move a little bit. And now I'm I'm
[07:09] lucky that I have a good friend of mine,
[07:10] Nico. You might have seen him in some of
[07:12] my previous videos. He's also an indie
[07:14] hacker. He used to manage um high
[07:17] budget, not like mine, like really high
[07:19] budget uh ads for like software and
[07:21] stuff. So he's really good at it and
[07:22] he's going to help me like with the
[07:23] targeting on Facebook and Instagram to
[07:25] make sure that you know the ad is seen
[07:27] by the right people. If that works, I
[07:28] will just report in those videos what I
[07:30] get from those ads. I really had no idea
[07:32] that today would be an ad day. I really
[07:35] don't like marketing. But when it
[07:37] becomes fun like this where it's like a
[07:39] very short tiny thing, I make a video
[07:41] that is hopefully fun. I come up with
[07:43] like weird ideas. One point here is if
[07:45] you ever see an ad that looks fun and
[07:48] it's quite easy to make, try to
[07:49] replicate that ad. Use the format they
[07:51] use because if you're seeing the ad, it
[07:53] means they're spending decent money. So
[07:55] it means that the ad somehow is working.
[07:57] take that ad, ask the AI to make the
[07:59] copyrightiting and the part that you you
[08:01] don't know and try to sell it somewhere
[08:02] on Instagram, Facebook, or just post the
[08:04] video on your own Instagram and see how
[08:06] that goes. A nice uh time for serious
[08:08] business. Today is a little bit of a
[08:09] special day. Not only because this is
[08:11] probably one of the most beautiful place
[08:12] I've ever stayed, but also because what
[08:14] if I die? Like I'm French and my company
[08:17] is in Singapore. I have a local director
[08:20] and there's a little over a million
[08:21] dollar in cash in the company. How do I
[08:23] make sure that my wife gets everything
[08:25] if something happened to me? So, I'm
[08:27] doing some boring legal stuff, but uh
[08:29] now I have my friend Chajipy who is
[08:31] going to I guess make my life much
[08:33] easier.
[08:34] [Music]
[08:40] In Singapore, company shares do not
[08:42] automatically transfer to a spouse upon
[08:45] death. Instead, they're handled through
[08:46] succession, laws, a will, and legal
[08:49] documents. I get some paperworks, I
[08:51] guess.
[08:52] [Music]
[09:01] Okay, I guess I uh I found this um this
[09:04] lawyer company or whatever this is. They
[09:06] have a little button to message them on
[09:08] WhatsApp, which is something I love
[09:09] about Asia. You can do everything on
[09:11] WhatsApp. I send them a a WhatsApp and
[09:14] uh I mentioned the fact that I want my
[09:16] wife to own everything if something
[09:18] happens to me. I know this is kind of an
[09:19] awkward question, but I was thinking
[09:21] I've been working hard for six years to
[09:24] create this thing and my wife has been
[09:26] my co-founder somehow. Like mentally,
[09:28] she's been here all the time. And I
[09:29] think she deserves to get every single
[09:31] beats that's left if I were to
[09:34] disappear. And I want to make sure that
[09:35] there's no friction for her to get it
[09:38] like having to fight in court or
[09:40] something like this. That took me 5
[09:42] minutes. Uh maybe that will take me
[09:43] another 30 minutes later and probably
[09:46] cost me $1,000 worth of lawy lawyer
[09:49] things, but at least I know that if
[09:51] anything happens, she has some sort of
[09:54] peace and will get all the rewards of,
[09:57] you know, all the things she's been
[09:58] she's been through because I would have
[10:00] never be able to make any of this
[10:01] without my wife.
[10:03] Um a [ __ ]
[10:06] No, but actually I'm a bit emotional at
[10:08] the moment. Oh, I think that's so good.
[10:11] It almost looks like it's a bye-bye, you
[10:13] know, like no, you're not going to die
[10:16] tomorrow. No, we'll sign a contract with
[10:18] a lawyer that says, you know, if
[10:20] anything happens, you will get
[10:22] everything of the company. Doesn't
[10:24] happen.
[10:26] Oh, no. Thank you for doing it just in
[10:28] case. You know, we never know, man. I'm
[10:30] just walking down the street and then
[10:32] there is one of those seagull who [ __ ]
[10:34] on me. He goes into my eyes, he gets
[10:36] infected. Boom. Death.
[10:39] All right. I don't really feel like
[10:41] working at the moment.
[10:43] So, why not taking a day off and enjoy
[10:46] this beautiful
[10:47] view? It's going up now. Woke up in a
[10:51] country lane. Don't know what happened.
[10:52] I don't know how I came to be at the end
[10:55] of my world with going up in
[11:01] smoke. Just watch your bra.
[11:06] Hey, you
[11:09] say all things don't go my way. Get
[11:18] [Music]
[11:23] me. All I have to do today is to build a
[11:27] bunch of features user requested. Life
[11:30] doesn't get any better than that.
[11:32] [Music]
[11:40] Yes, this is the best time of the day. I
[11:44] think I shipped around six features all
[11:46] requested by my customers. That's very
[11:48] important. Let me show you this. This is
[11:50] it. Those like this little card here is
[11:52] where I display all the new features
[11:53] that I've shipped on the app. And um
[11:55] most of them come from this one. So, I
[11:57] collect feedback from my customers. And
[11:58] one of the most requested feedback was I
[12:00] want to exclude renewal revenue from uh
[12:03] my metrics. So first thing what I did is
[12:05] I now split the revenue into two
[12:07] categories. The new revenue and the
[12:09] recurring revenue usually coming from
[12:11] subscriptions or recurring customers.
[12:12] And so it's quite subtle but the color
[12:14] like there's different shades of orange
[12:16] here to uh differentiate which is new
[12:18] which is renewal. And then I've created
[12:20] a little setting where people can turn
[12:22] off these like renewal uh revenue
[12:24] included into their KPIs. And so this
[12:26] revenue per visitor will include or not
[12:28] include the recurring revenue. And
[12:30] because shipping is fun, I also include
[12:32] in refunds. So um now in gray color, uh
[12:35] if like a payment was refunded, then
[12:38] it's going to be shown in gray. And the
[12:40] revenue will of course not be included
[12:41] in the revenue per visitor. And finally,
[12:43] the last update I made, I think this one
[12:45] is more for me. Um I was really curious
[12:47] what happens when people visit my site
[12:49] but don't purchase on the first day. For
[12:52] instance, for this person, I know that
[12:53] they found my website through Beehive,
[12:55] so likely my newsletter, and they did
[12:58] not make a purchase on the day they
[13:00] viewed the site. And I was really
[13:01] curious like when they make a purchase
[13:02] or the next days, where do they find my
[13:05] site? Do they click a tweet? Do they
[13:07] click do they go on Google? Whatever.
[13:08] And now I can see I added like this
[13:10] little line where I can see the new
[13:11] referral. And so now I know that this
[13:14] person found through my newsletter on
[13:16] the first day. And then when he they
[13:17] came back by typing codefast on Google.
[13:19] If you're a user of datafast, I hope
[13:21] you'll like this new update.
[13:24] We're going from Christ Church to
[13:26] Timaru. In Christ Church, we're so busy
[13:28] we couldn't make much YouTube video.
[13:31] Instead, you made like masterpiece. Is
[13:33] it a masterpiece?
[13:35] I hope so. So, what is that video? It's
[13:36] one of the questions people ask me the
[13:38] most often is like, how would you learn
[13:39] to code again now that there is AI? This
[13:42] is kind of like the road map I had for
[13:43] codefast. It's like I highlight to you
[13:45] all the steps you need to go from zero
[13:48] to coding a SAS and coding faster with
[13:51] AI. And uh it's about 3 hours long, but
[13:53] the comments people who watch this
[13:55] videos like they it's extremely helpful
[13:57] and man that's that's it goes straight
[14:00] to my heart because I spent so much time
[14:01] making this video. I'm very happy that
[14:03] it's helpful and some people watch it
[14:06] and you know learn how to cook with it.
[14:08] This is the video Mark was working on
[14:10] for how long? 3 weeks. 3 weeks. So
[14:13] basically the video is it walks you
[14:16] through the first step which is like
[14:17] understanding how the the internet works
[14:19] the fundamentals. Then we go through
[14:21] building an entire software from zero.
[14:23] So complete beginner teaching the basics
[14:25] of like what is an API, what is front
[14:26] end, what is a back end, how do you make
[14:28] a landing page, how to create a
[14:29] dashboard, what is a database and then
[14:31] the end of the video is mostly how I use
[14:33] AI to code faster. Definitely if you
[14:36] want to learn code just check it out
[14:38] like in 3 hour you can learn everything
[14:39] what you need to learn. I'll put it in
[14:42] the card.
[14:49] This is a really beautiful place. I
[14:51] think I want this in our house. So, does
[14:52] it make you creative? This makes me
[14:54] creative. What did you find? This I was
[14:56] stuck. I think I found something. I want
[14:57] to know what you think. The thumbnail
[14:59] for the video like I use the movie split
[15:00] different personality like seven
[15:02] versions of me. When you click, there's
[15:04] like 5 to 10 seconds of play and you're
[15:06] like playing the movie Split and then
[15:07] after a little glitch and be like, "All
[15:09] right." And then explain the video like
[15:10] intro. Like maybe there could be like a
[15:11] programmer that is worried that AI is
[15:14] going to replace them and there's
[15:15] another programmer who's like uh not at
[15:17] all like you know that doesn't make any
[15:19] sense. I want to play those two
[15:22] characters. I think I found it. I found
[15:24] it. This will be the background. Okay.
[15:25] We have to make sure we leave this
[15:26] Airbnb and publish this video after the
[15:28] host reviewed us. Otherwise they will be
[15:30] like who the [ __ ] are those
[15:34] weirdos? All right. So I I uh ditched
[15:38] the previous book. Sorry Mr. de Martin,
[15:40] but I just I don't know. I didn't
[15:42] connect and I started this new book, The
[15:44] Expectation Effect. This is a book that
[15:46] was recommended on Twitter from Alex, a
[15:48] really good guy. His entire Twitter
[15:50] account is dedicated to recommending
[15:52] books that he loves. And uh this is
[15:54] excellent. It's fun because I've read
[15:56] just one page and I knew instantly that
[15:59] this was a book for me. It's hard to
[16:01] explain why, but it was like a clear
[16:04] yes. This is probably we are this house
[16:06] we have been everything is super old.
[16:09] You have this like savana animal. I need
[16:11] to show other weird stuff. This I mean
[16:14] it's not weird in itself. It's just
[16:16] weird as a part of this Airbnb where you
[16:18] have like spiritual stuff, old stuff,
[16:20] new stuff. Like inside you have this
[16:22] thing. I mean to be honest, yeah, there
[16:24] I want to remember those moments. Oh
[16:26] wow. Oh wow. So beautiful. I want to
[16:29] take a photo. Okay, we have to take a
[16:31] photo of this.
[16:34] So over the rain. This is the thumbnail
[16:39] I was working on yesterday. I hope it
[16:41] was worth it. And today is a video
[16:43] recording day. This uh video should be
[16:46] on YouTube a week before or after this
[16:48] vlog. I hope you like the video, too.
[16:50] Let's
[16:52] shoot. Bro, stop coding. What? AI is
[16:55] getting so good. They they they say it's
[16:56] going to replace us. Replace us. We've
[16:59] built an entire company just using AI.
[17:02] Customer support for Startup 13. How can
[17:04] I help you today? Why does everything
[17:06] has to be blue? And someone delete the
[17:08] fishing email. We are so screwed here.
[17:10] We don't offer refunds. I'm sorry. We
[17:11] need to change the border radius here.
[17:13] We We should have used TypeScript.
[17:15] Hello. Boom. Oh no,
[17:19] guys. We need a meeting right now. Did
[17:22] AI just turned me into a manager?
[17:33] Let there be guitar.
[17:39] All right,
[17:41] boy. Let there be rock. Let there be
[17:44] coffee. New Zealand is so beautiful.
[17:46] It's crazy. It's really beautiful. Like
[17:48] even the sunrise, this just the sun
[17:50] itself is is beautiful.
[17:53] This is very interesting. It's a study
[17:55] about the effect on placeos on relieving
[17:58] Parkinson disease. And it's really fun
[18:00] to see that the price of the drug people
[18:02] will pay to be healed will impact how
[18:05] they will be healed. It basically says
[18:07] that the higher they pay for the the
[18:09] peel, the higher the results they will
[18:11] get, which is really fun cuz it's super
[18:13] tied to what we do. I think I see a lots
[18:15] of developers often making this mistakes
[18:16] of pricing their products too cheap. Um,
[18:19] when you're getting started, I know it's
[18:21] tricky to ask for people money on the
[18:23] internet, but it's very important to
[18:24] price accurately because just the price
[18:26] itself without even seeing the product
[18:28] reflects on how good people will think
[18:30] the product is. It's called perceived
[18:32] value and unlike the actual product
[18:34] where it needs a lot of work, you can
[18:36] just, you know, increase just a little
[18:38] bit your pricing to make it seems like
[18:39] it's a better product. Of course, the
[18:41] product after has to deliver the value,
[18:43] but uh it's usually a mistake that I see
[18:45] developers make by pressing a little too
[18:47] cheap when they're getting started. And
[18:49] if you have no idea how to start with
[18:51] your pricing, the best is to look at
[18:52] what competitors are doing and price
[18:54] just a little higher or look at other
[18:56] industries and applies what they do for
[18:58] yours. Back to this masterpiece.
[19:01] What are you reading? The same book as
[19:03] you. Do you like it so far? I absolutely
[19:05] loved it because life is all about
[19:07] dealing with expectation to yourself to
[19:10] the other. Same as atomic habit. If you
[19:12] make the identity that you believe who
[19:16] you are, then you will behave in certain
[19:18] way to do so. Even though you're not the
[19:21] person yet, if you believe like you're a
[19:24] good entpreneur, you're a good runner,
[19:26] you're a good, you know, friend, then
[19:28] you will do your best to, you know, be
[19:32] become like that. If you're not inspired
[19:34] after this pep talk.
[19:38] All right, that's enough for today. Uh,
[19:41] this is a really good book. Now, time
[19:43] for workout luggage packing and we are
[19:46] going to a new place where there
[19:48] some workout is the second best legal
[19:52] drug on the planet after sleep. Take one
[19:54] dose daily. Side effect might include
[19:57] occasional flexing in the mirror.
[20:03] It's 9:20 a.m. 22 minutes of a heavy
[20:06] workout, intense workout, and I'm set
[20:09] for the day. Airbnb check out is in 20
[20:11] minutes. And uh on the road
[20:14] again. The best electronic backpack no
[20:16] one talks
[20:17] about. Getting
[20:20] dirty. This is so
[20:23] [Music]
[20:25] heavy. Making YouTube videos is a
[20:27] workout. Let's go.
[20:31] [Music]
[20:39] We're finally arrived. Finally. Here we
[20:42] go, mate. Let's see what color it is.
[20:44] Yes, sir. Surprise.
[20:48] [Music]
[20:55] Wow, we just entered the paradise.
[20:58] Welcome Denmark. Okay, I think this is
[21:01] the most unexpected like out of what we
[21:04] are normally used to Airbnb.
[21:08] Okay, are you ready? Just look around.
[21:10] Just look around. Wow, the view. Every
[21:14] morning we're going to have coffee while
[21:16] watching this amazing view. I feel like
[21:18] I'm in an old man's house. And this is
[21:21] such a dream. Imagine you have a little
[21:22] door that leads to the ocean. Yeah. So
[21:25] nice.
[21:28] There are seals everywhere. Yeah,
[21:29] exactly.
[21:31] This is so nice. Yeah, this one looks
[21:34] dead. There are like
[21:37] one that I freaking love nature. It's so
[21:40] beautiful. That's true. It makes me so
[21:42] happy to be next to them.
[21:45] I think we can also walk on the rings
[21:47] later
[21:49] when it's low tide.
[21:52] [Music]
[22:01] She was scratching her head. Yeah. With
[22:04] her weird like
[22:06] [Music]
[22:08] legs. Oh,
[22:13] actually they don't do [ __ ] Careful.
[22:33] breakfast.
[22:35] So good.
[22:38] [Music]
[22:46] [Music]
[22:51] All right. Oh, it's time to get some
[22:53] work done. And today I'm doing my
[22:55] favorite activity of the year,
[22:57] accounting. But I'm not doing the
[22:59] accounting myself. Uh I have an
[23:01] accountant doing it for me. I'm just
[23:02] reviewing the profit and loss statement,
[23:04] making sure that uh everything is right.
[23:07] My P&L should be somewhere around this
[23:08] video. It's in Singapore dollars. It's
[23:10] the total revenue for all of my sources
[23:12] of income. I think I have somewhere
[23:14] around like 10 sources of income in
[23:15] total. And when doing the P&L, I was
[23:17] surprised that the revenue is around I
[23:20] think $1.5 million in Singapore dollars.
[23:22] And the profit was 1.2 Singapore and
[23:24] Singapore dollars, which is around 80%
[23:26] profit margin. And I'm not the type of
[23:28] guy who cut corners. So I I am really
[23:31] easy peasy on the bills and stuff. I
[23:32] don't try to save money. I try to make
[23:34] more money instead. So I could optimize
[23:36] those profit margin. And I was still
[23:37] thinking 80% profit margin knowing that
[23:40] I have no meetups. I have uh no
[23:42] ownership. I don't owe anything to
[23:44] anyone. I'm not renting a place. I don't
[23:46] manage um employees. I don't have like
[23:48] payrolls at the end of the year or
[23:50] something. And that made me think of a
[23:51] little story back in 2016 when I was
[23:54] working as a waiter. I was earning
[23:55] around $10 per hour and I was working 10
[23:58] hours a day. So, at the end of the day,
[23:59] I would be paid $100 and I would bring
[24:02] to the business around $2,000. I know
[24:04] that because at the end of the day, we
[24:05] had to count all the bills and tell the
[24:07] business owner how much money uh we made
[24:09] on the day. And back in that restaurant,
[24:11] there were around five waiters at a
[24:13] time. And so I was thinking like this
[24:14] business owner sells around $10,000 per
[24:17] day worth of food. Of course, there's
[24:19] ingredient, the rental, the cook to pay.
[24:22] But I was still thinking like that's
[24:23] around $300,000 per month or $3.6
[24:27] million per year. This guy, the owner,
[24:29] might be freaking rich. I really wanted
[24:31] to know how much money he makes by the
[24:33] end of the year. But because we were in
[24:34] France, it's kind of like it's it's a
[24:36] bit of a taboo topic. You don't ask
[24:37] someone how much money you're making. So
[24:39] I tried to ask without asking and he
[24:42] told me it's not what do you think it
[24:44] is. I never really understood until
[24:46] today where I asked Chadip what is the
[24:49] average profit margin for a restaurant
[24:51] and I figured out that if he wants to
[24:53] make the similar amount of money that I
[24:54] made in 2024 with a restaurant you need
[24:57] to make $20 million. And here I am with
[25:01] my little $1.5 million in revenue. Those
[25:04] two businesses are making the same
[25:06] profit by the end of the year. And on
[25:08] top of that, there's no risk that one of
[25:09] my employee cuts his finger while
[25:11] cutting a piece of meat. I'm not going
[25:12] to injure typing on my keyboard. And
[25:14] this made me realize that for the same
[25:16] output, the input is completely
[25:18] different. To make $1 million in profit,
[25:21] you need $1.2 million in revenue with
[25:23] the digital product, and you need 20
[25:26] million in revenue with the restaurant.
[25:28] For instance, this little product made
[25:30] $15,000 last year. It cost around $2 to
[25:33] $3 a month to send emails and it runs
[25:35] for like $10 a month. So that's roughly
[25:38] 95% profit margin. Or you can create a
[25:41] product with the name poop in it makes a
[25:44] couple hundred a month and this cost $0
[25:47] a month to maintain. Or this little
[25:49] software that makes $2,000 a month and
[25:51] it cost less than $10,000 to run per
[25:54] month. So roughly all of my tiny
[25:55] software product have around 95% profit
[25:57] margin. And on top of this, I don't need
[26:00] to do much customer support. My products
[26:02] are running 24/7. The take away from
[26:04] this is profit is not revenue. And with
[26:06] a digital product, you don't need to hit
[26:08] crazy numbers in order to pay for your
[26:10] living. And now it has never been a
[26:11] better time in history to build
[26:13] something. With AI coming up with great
[26:15] marketing ideas, helping you coding and
[26:17] build those products. Now is the time.
[26:19] Or be like this guy and don't give a
[26:21] [ __ ] about life in whatsoever way.
[26:25] [Music]
[26:27] It's working.
[26:29] [Music]
[26:34] Oh, he's [ __ ] it like this. Is what
[26:35] a sea seal [ __ ] looks like. And this
[26:38] is a post [ __ ] face. Yes. Relieved.
[26:43] Yes. So relieved.
