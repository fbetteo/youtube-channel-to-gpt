[00:03] imagine a plant that's connected to a
[00:06] fitness tracker that gets
[00:09] water automatically every time you work
[00:17] [Music]
[00:27] out I build 20 4 startups and 23 failed
[00:33] well some of them made a couple hundred
[00:34] some was a couple thousand per month but
[00:37] nothing crazy it didn't change my life
[00:38] and it did not transform the life of my
[00:40] customers but one of them changed my
[00:43] life and uh I'm trying to understand
[00:45] what was in my head how did I came up
[00:47] with this idea I would like to reproduce
[00:49] that so this this is what this video is
[00:51] all
[00:58] about the weather call
[01:00] the weather so chill Chilly Willy
[01:03] penguin feather R cuz I'm sipping Pro
[01:05] yeah that meth pro pro methine yeah a
[01:08] stepping stone oh they acting up get
[01:11] your weapons WR they only Killing Time
[01:13] Another Second gone 2 hours of train 2
[01:16] hours of delay welcome to friends during
[01:18] the
[01:21] Olympics I married my wife two times one
[01:24] time here in France in 2021 and it was
[01:27] um W I have a question
[01:30] okay how would you describe our wedding
[01:32] in France using just one word um
[01:36] wow uh
[01:38] Noy dog I'm dog wild wild
[01:44] uh-huh and we married a second time in
[01:46] South Korea for the other side of the
[01:48] family that couldn't come during covid
[01:50] it was more of a cultural wedding and it
[01:52] was the first time for me to turn off my
[01:55] computer completely for 2 weeks I don't
[01:58] like taking time off for two
[02:02] [Music]
[02:15] reason so I don't like taking time off
[02:18] for two reasons first I believe that
[02:20] entrepreneurship is all about making
[02:22] small bits launching start up over and
[02:24] over until one sticks and second because
[02:27] I just love creating stuff AB videos I'm
[02:30] just addicted to it so why should I take
[02:33] some time
[02:34] off after coming back from South Korea
[02:37] after 2 weeks with my family no work no
[02:39] computer I came back with a tiny
[02:41] business idea that changed my life it
[02:43] took around one week to build it and
[02:45] then I launched it last year and fast
[02:47] forward to today this idea generated
[02:50] $800,000 my best business idea came up
[02:54] when I was not thinking about business
[02:56] idea
[03:01] [Music]
[03:21] hold it hold it hold
[03:23] it what are those
[03:27] shoes I lost my shoes I don't think
[03:30] there is a recipe for successful
[03:32] businesses idea but I noticed a
[03:37] pattern I forgot to press record for the
[03:39] next clip so here it is in a different
[03:42] location I have been brainstorming ideas
[03:45] for years but none of them worked my
[03:47] only success was born by accident it's
[03:49] because I had to take some time off when
[03:51] all I wanted to do was to work more and
[03:54] it's similar for other entrepreneurs
[03:56] they're not thinking about a billion
[03:58] dollar idea they're either solving their
[04:00] own problems and realize that millions
[04:02] of other people have the same thing or
[04:04] they're playing with a new tech that
[04:05] just come out successful businesses are
[04:07] born by accident it's unexpected and to
[04:09] create an accident you have to put your
[04:11] work out there you don't even need a
[04:13] good idea to start you can write about
[04:15] something you learned last year you can
[04:17] rebuild your favorite application just
[04:19] for the sake of it you can send a call
[04:20] email to a business or you can marry a
[04:22] current wife but that's that's another
[04:24] story doing new things is how you
[04:26] discover problems real problems problems
[04:28] that people will pay pay you to solve
[04:30] and in the end you might create a
[04:32] successful business that you could have
[04:33] never thought of all right back to the
[04:38] [Music]
[04:43] Vlog I just come back from a 2 weeks
[04:45] holiday with a tiny business ID in mind
[04:48] I hope that's the oneac
