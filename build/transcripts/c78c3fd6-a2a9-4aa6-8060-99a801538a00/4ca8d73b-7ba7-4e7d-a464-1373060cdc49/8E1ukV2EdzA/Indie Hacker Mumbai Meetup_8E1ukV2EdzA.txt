[04:08] Check. Check. Check here.
[18:01] very
[18:02] friendly. Nice to meet you, man. Okay,
[18:05] we Okay, we got guys like just go, you
[18:09] know, like in front of me. Yeah. Yeah.
[18:11] Yeah. Like really uh like face to face.
[18:16] Okay. You can even come in the center if
[18:18] you want. Sit down. It's up to you.
[18:21] Okay. Sit down. Why not? Okay. That's
[18:23] fun. We we tried this morning to imagine
[18:25] how and imagine but just perfect you
[18:27] know. Okay.
[18:30] Um
[18:32] so I think we uh can like we have
[18:35] everything
[18:36] live Twitter every like everything
[18:39] working. We have no Okay. Okay. So we
[18:42] can start. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh well
[18:44] pardon me. I'm also a little stressed
[18:45] because uh I normally never do
[18:47] presentation. That's the first time I
[18:48] take a microphone. So my heart is
[18:51] bumping like crazy at the moment.
[18:54] Um, I'm super grateful for all of you
[18:56] coming here. Um, we're going to we have
[18:58] cooked a few stuff this morning. So,
[19:00] we're going to have fun. Um, we're going
[19:02] to start with uh this. I want to show
[19:04] you this those two things. You can scan
[19:06] this if you want. Uh, during the meetup,
[19:08] you will need this uh QR code at some
[19:10] point. We're going to do some kind of
[19:12] like Q&A. So we actually built a mini
[19:14] app this morning where you can submit
[19:17] question about them like product hunt
[19:19] but for this meetup specifically and
[19:23] this is a this is a weird experiment
[19:25] where if you flash it you will see all
[19:27] of you guys in this room and maybe the
[19:29] people watching the live stream uh on
[19:31] the globe. So this is a this this is
[19:34] just a fun experiment. I will show this
[19:36] later if you want but it's good if you
[19:37] scan it now because you'll have to
[19:38] create an account for this to submit
[19:40] questions. So hopefully we we limit the
[19:42] spam. Uh I don't know where that's going
[19:44] to go but we can give it a try. Okay.
[19:48] Curious who here uh came and flew or
[19:51] took a train who is not from
[19:53] Mumbai. Oh wow. That's about half of the
[19:56] room. That's sick.
[19:58] Okay. Super cool. Okay. Thanks. Thank
[20:00] you all of you for coming. This is
[20:02] amazing. Um a few questions. Who who
[20:05] here can code or vibe
[20:09] code? So we literally have GitHub here.
[20:12] Okay. Okay. Cool. Who has built some
[20:16] sort of like tiny side project and push
[20:18] to
[20:19] production? Almost the entire room as
[20:21] well. Who is who has made $1
[20:24] online or Indian
[20:27] rupia? Okay. Okay. And who makes enough
[20:30] to not have a
[20:33] job? That's so cool. Oh, so nice. Okay.
[20:36] Okay. And who is retired?
[20:38] [Laughter]
[20:42] Okay. Um, well, I wanted to start really
[20:44] quick with a a little story. This is
[20:47] 2021. This was one of the very first
[20:49] tweets I made. Um, I think we most of us
[20:52] are here because of this person here,
[20:54] Peter Levels, who inspired most of us to
[20:57] get started. Uh, for me it started in
[20:59] 2021 and I started sharing my thoughts
[21:01] on the internet and back then I had uh,
[21:04] no goal. I just packed three years of
[21:06] kind of failure. I would say nothing
[21:08] crazy was really happening but I just
[21:10] thought you know I would start again the
[21:11] journey with a simple approach just make
[21:14] a bunch of apps uh build them fast see
[21:17] what sticks and just move on quickly
[21:20] obviously my stripe dashboard would look
[21:21] like this most of the days um but after
[21:24] keeping practicing for months and maybe
[21:26] years I one of my projects started to uh
[21:30] take off and a few others later and that
[21:33] things change and um and life you become
[21:37] even uh better. So I was really happy
[21:39] and I wanted to mention that it is like
[21:42] we often call it luck or something else
[21:44] but this is not about you know getting
[21:47] lucky. This is not about being super
[21:49] smart or have massive skills or
[21:51] anything. In the end the my journey at
[21:53] least came from people the people I've
[21:56] met across this journey are the one who
[21:58] helped me get from like the zero stage
[22:01] to uh talking to all of you guys right
[22:03] now. Um those are some of the people I
[22:06] met that have literally changed my life.
[22:08] The guy who initiated me about
[22:10] marketing. Um I mean those guys too. Uh
[22:12] those are like they they inspired me so
[22:14] much. Uh I got a chance to at some point
[22:17] talk to them and they shaped they they
[22:19] would tell me what I was doing wrong.
[22:20] They would tell me what I should do
[22:22] instead. And I've been listening to them
[22:23] and that's the those are the part of the
[22:25] journey that made me go from like
[22:27] nothing to uh again this. And so since
[22:30] it's mostly about people, that's why I
[22:33] started organizing those little events.
[22:35] Uh I started in France where I'm from
[22:37] back was it four months ago. The first
[22:39] one was in January this year. Uh people
[22:42] loved it because um again the idea is to
[22:44] help you guys find someone next to you
[22:47] who hopefully can become your
[22:48] co-founder, can inspire you, can
[22:50] challenge you. It's very important to
[22:51] challenge each other. Um so I'm trying
[22:53] to make those events in order for you
[22:55] guys to you know connect because you
[22:57] already have something in common. you
[22:58] are apparently all developers which is a
[23:00] good thing. You also have this like
[23:02] desire to create your own project. So
[23:04] that's why you're all here together
[23:05] today. Um talking about other people, my
[23:09] wife who is right here is one of also
[23:12] the person that really impacted a lot in
[23:14] the journey. Um she's been supportive
[23:16] for everything and this is very
[23:18] important. And I wanted to show this
[23:20] photo of my good friend Wahab here. Uh
[23:23] we could see right on with the pink
[23:25] shirt. uh he we started working together
[23:28] last year. He has been the brain and he
[23:31] still is the brain behind uh data fast a
[23:33] web analytics tools that I made. Uh he
[23:35] handles all the server stuff and um and
[23:38] again like this wouldn't be possible
[23:40] without him and it's just wanted to you
[23:42] know really uh emphasize on how
[23:44] important people around you
[23:47] are. Um okay this is a very nice chip
[23:52] generative image with the quote to
[23:54] summarize it's all about the people
[23:56] around you that will uh help you in this
[23:58] journey. So what we're going to do for
[24:00] this meetup because the goal is uh I
[24:02] hope you come back with you know friends
[24:03] and stuff. So we're going to do start
[24:05] with a little fireside fireside chat. Uh
[24:07] we're going to be is going to be 30
[24:09] minutes. We're going to use the cure
[24:10] code. I'm going to go over that later.
[24:12] Uh then we're going to go over a little
[24:13] debug my startup session where uh the
[24:16] stage will disappear. You guys will hang
[24:17] out with five people and you will try
[24:20] each other to debug uh whatever bug
[24:22] you're having at the moment. I'm going
[24:23] to explain also a little later what
[24:24] we're going to do and we're going to
[24:25] finish uh with whatever time we have
[24:27] left with vibe chatting u you know just
[24:30] no mic and we're going to be around here
[24:32] and if you guys want to chat or whatever
[24:34] we're going to be doing just that. Um I
[24:37] also wanted to mention one thing this
[24:38] company here uh was so kind to sponsor
[24:41] this meetup. So this entire venue is
[24:42] possible because of uh code rabbit. It's
[24:45] a little tool that help you ship safe.
[24:47] It reuses your code when you push to
[24:49] prod. Uh they also very kind to give me
[24:50] a coupon code. Actually, I think I read.
[24:53] No, I don't. Oh, yeah. Like Marlue, if
[24:55] you use this code, you will get two
[24:57] months for free, which is very nice of
[24:58] them. So, thank you, God Rabbit. Um with
[25:02] nothing further ado, we can start with a
[25:03] fireside chat. So, for that,
[25:06] um what we So, it's going to be some
[25:09] sort of a Q&A. Hear me out. I'm trying
[25:10] something here. It's going to be a sort
[25:12] of a Q&A if you so you will have this uh
[25:15] QR code here where you can ask questions
[25:17] or we can also ask questions just like
[25:19] this. The person who asked the question
[25:20] will come with me on the stage. It's
[25:22] it's scary. I I'll admit like my heart
[25:24] is still bumping but it's fun. We're
[25:26] going to give you a mic and you can ask
[25:28] any questions because I receive lots of
[25:30] uh DM from people and I realize that
[25:32] often the questions are kind of similar
[25:33] and I I hope that I could answer like
[25:35] help in any way answer those questions
[25:38] uh live because you might have the same
[25:40] question as your neighbor, the person
[25:41] next to you or anything. So, um feel
[25:44] free to ask anything. There's a you'll
[25:45] see there's a form uh we're going to I
[25:47] think we're going to ask people who've
[25:50] been working. I didn't make this up.
[25:51] This is what helped you who uh build the
[25:54] entire MVP this morning. And we're going
[25:56] to see which questions are coming up.
[25:58] And there we go. Do we have any like we
[26:03] have lots of questions. Oh, sick. Maybe
[26:05] you want to do you want to come on the
[26:08] stage? I know. Okay. I know you don't
[26:10] like stage. Okay. Maybe I'll just take
[26:12] the phone
[26:13] then. Thanks.
[26:18] Okay. Okay.
[26:21] Okay. All right. How do you build
[26:24] distributions from Vich V? Do we have
[26:28] Vich V here?
[26:30] V I S HV.
[26:33] Yeah. Come on in,
[26:34] buddy. Do we have the second mic as
[26:36] well? Yeah. Uh, okay. We You know what?
[26:41] Nice to meet Nice to meet you. Your name
[26:43] is Vish, right? Visha. Okay. So, what
[26:47] are you working on at the moment? Uh, I
[26:49] have built a concept mapmaker. Um so it
[26:52] generates content. Um so like the
[26:56] problem it solve is that when you enter
[26:58] any info in chat GPD you keep on asking
[27:01] it question so you have to scroll all
[27:02] the way down and then find it again and
[27:04] again. So my app what it does is it
[27:07] makes maps around the content like let's
[27:09] say you want to study computer science
[27:11] so it will map a content on the screen.
[27:13] You can drag the nodes and elements.
[27:15] It's quite interactive like it's not um
[27:18] it's not a normal website. You can
[27:21] generate um content any concept you can
[27:24] study. Uh you can even link YouTube
[27:26] videos research paper and now I'm
[27:28] working on Wikipedia plug-in to pull
[27:30] Wikipedia information inside that. Okay.
[27:34] Okay. And at the moment do you have have
[27:36] you launched to prod? Uh yeah it's
[27:41] live man do you think we could get his
[27:43] website on the projector that would be
[27:46] super fun.
[27:48] What is what is your URL? What is where
[27:51] could we find the the site? Uh
[27:55] onel concept map AI concept map. Um
[28:00] should I type it? Yeah, actually yeah.
[28:02] It's fine.
[28:07] So I think the question is about
[28:09] distribution which is probably the
[28:10] number one question people ask me. It's
[28:13] like mostly marketing.
[28:17] So hopefully we get something out of
[28:33] the So this is
[28:41] it. Okay.
[28:45] So,
[28:47] oh, okay. So, can you walk us around how
[28:51] does it does it work like real quick?
[28:53] Um, okay.
[28:59] Oh, it's like is it you make map like
[29:01] road maps? Uh, no concept map. It uh
[29:04] links the information about any thing
[29:06] you are learning. Okay. Okay. Okay. So,
[29:09] what are the numbers at the moment? Like
[29:10] how many users do you have? Uh, no.
[29:13] Zero. Zero. Okay. You're Okay. You're
[29:14] about to push it live. Uh, it is live,
[29:16] but um I don't have any users yet. Okay.
[29:19] Okay. What how did you set up your
[29:21] pricing for this one? I haven't. It's
[29:23] open source. Like if you if you have
[29:25] your open uh open API, you can use it
[29:28] locally. Oh, okay. So, you're targeting
[29:30] developers mostly. Yeah, like the open
[29:32] source kind kind of thing. Yeah. And so,
[29:35] you the question was about distribution.
[29:37] Your goal is to get more contributors.
[29:39] Uh, yeah. And users. I I want people to
[29:41] use it.
[29:43] Okay. Okay. Okay.
[29:45] Okay. And so it's completely free. Yeah.
[29:48] Okay. Um can you could you scroll the to
[29:52] the hero
[29:56] section? Yeah. If you can like scroll
[29:58] back to the top of the site just to see
[29:59] the
[30:03] headline. Okay. It's so you said so you
[30:06] you have zero users using it at the
[30:08] moment but have you have you had people
[30:10] sign up? Uh mostly my friends I don't
[30:13] have like organic real users for this.
[30:15] Okay. And did you launch on Twitter like
[30:18] all the launching platforms? Uh yeah I
[30:20] tried uh get uh Twitter and then um
[30:23] Reddit. Okay. How they go?
[30:27] Uh no views. No views. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[30:31] Um, I think in your case you want you
[30:34] either want to like be super specific to
[30:36] the people who would be using this. So
[30:38] find like a I don't know like
[30:40] developers/d doctors or something like
[30:42] like really a specific niche of people
[30:43] and speak their language and like find
[30:46] 10 people who absolutely love the app.
[30:48] 10 people that you don't know that
[30:50] absolutely love the app. Okay, that's I
[30:52] think that's would be one way to do
[30:57] it. Let me think.
[31:01] I think have you considered making it
[31:03] paid because you're you're it solves a
[31:06] problem like a a strong problem for
[31:08] people. Have you considered opening like
[31:10] adding a pricing p page on it or
[31:12] something? No, but I can think about
[31:13] pricing and all.
[31:15] Okay. I think you might there's one
[31:18] thing also I've learned is the fact that
[31:20] you ask people for like a payment ahead
[31:23] or not necessarily ahead but the fact
[31:25] that you make something paid makes
[31:28] people value your work. When it's free
[31:30] there's a tendency of like oh it's free
[31:32] I'll check it out later. When it's paid
[31:34] you pay attention because you know that
[31:36] there is something there there could be
[31:37] some value out there for you. Okay. So I
[31:40] think I would probably consider the
[31:41] paying
[31:42] road especially if you're targeting
[31:44] developers because developers usually
[31:45] have you know like they have they have
[31:47] money
[31:48] so I'm targeting uh general audience
[31:51] like students, teachers, professor like
[31:53] you can learn anything on this like not
[31:55] developer specific but you said you have
[31:58] to use your open AI key right? Yeah. If
[32:00] you want to set up locally you can use
[32:01] it. Okay. I would be crystal clear about
[32:03] that. You want to I think it's a it's a
[32:06] positioning thing here. You want to know
[32:08] who would be using this app. Maybe
[32:10] you're doing it maybe for your sister
[32:12] who is, I don't know, studying how to
[32:13] become a vet or something. You want to
[32:15] target those people and speak their
[32:16] language because if you land on a site
[32:18] and you show too many options, people
[32:20] will tend to just drop and not care
[32:23] because there are too much things
[32:24] available for them. That's why one of
[32:26] the things that I love the most is to
[32:28] launch the minimal version of a product,
[32:30] the simplest one, like ultra very
[32:32] targeted towards one specific type of
[32:34] people, and then you pass the message
[32:36] directly to them. And if it's a flop,
[32:38] you can just rebrand and make a new, now
[32:40] you say concept map.AI, you can rebrand
[32:43] it, rename it or something, and try a
[32:45] new launch of the same concept, but for
[32:47] a different niche. Okay. And that way
[32:49] you have multiple shots and you can you
[32:51] can keep the same product with a
[32:52] different landing page and shot multiple
[32:55] times for different niche and hopefully
[32:57] at some point one will stick. Yeah. Any
[32:59] Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I got it. Okay. Cool.
[33:05] [Music]
[33:05] [Applause]
[33:11] Oh, if you find something interesting.
[33:13] This is interesting. Okay. This one the
[33:16] the first line is interesting. First
[33:18] dollar is always the hardest like a
[33:20] pull-up. So if you have to start today,
[33:23] how would you market your product with a
[33:24] zero dollar budget from Kai? Do we have
[33:28] a Kai? You have a Kai. Do you want to
[33:29] come on stage? Yeah. Nice. Okay. Nice,
[33:32] man. So your name is Kai, right? No. No.
[33:34] My name is S like I use some other
[33:36] account. Okay. Nickname. Nice. Yeah.
[33:40] Fine. So yeah, it's always the first
[33:42] pullup is always a difficult like even
[33:44] it was with my case and many of others.
[33:46] I guess the second, third, fourth is
[33:47] easier. Similarly with our startups, the
[33:49] first dollar is the hardest one to get
[33:51] the first customer. So if you want to if
[33:53] you are starting today not on 2021, how
[33:56] you you market your products to get your
[33:58] first dollar with zero audience, you
[34:00] don't have 100k like you have that on
[34:02] Twitter or somewhere.
[34:04] Okay. Uh do do you want me to answer
[34:07] specifically about you or do you want me
[34:08] to answer how would I do it really?
[34:10] Yeah. How you will be doing it like with
[34:12] zero budget? Because see this helps me
[34:14] to learn how you are thinking like what
[34:16] are the other ways other channels that I
[34:17] can also use. Okay. And there I think
[34:20] there are many ways to get customers.
[34:21] There are some guys who are crushing it
[34:23] with being completely anonymous. My
[34:25] thing I like building an audience
[34:26] because this is happening and this is
[34:28] amazing. So I would definitely build an
[34:31] audience again. I would start from
[34:33] scratch. Whatever I would do to try
[34:35] building an audience. I think Twitter is
[34:37] a really good place to get started
[34:38] because it's easy to make a tweet. Okay.
[34:41] And sometimes you don't know, you can
[34:42] randomly go viral. So, I would go with
[34:44] Twitter, but I wouldn't use Twitter as
[34:46] my go-to place. I would probably think
[34:49] difference and have either an account on
[34:52] Instagram, Instagram, Tik Tok, like
[34:54] those short form platform or more
[34:56] long-term videos with a proper YouTube
[34:58] channel. Okay, I would start like this
[35:01] because Twitter is also getting more
[35:03] competitive. If you were on Twitter like
[35:05] in 2018, there were barely any indie
[35:07] hackers. It was small smaller community.
[35:09] it was kind of easier to get your
[35:10] product outside but also you would get
[35:12] less traffic. So a different story now.
[35:14] I think it's getting busier. You can
[35:16] still stand out but it's there's more
[35:18] competition. So if you go for other
[35:20] platforms where like to be honest like
[35:22] indie hacking the soloreneur journey
[35:25] none of my friends who are not part of
[35:27] this community they still have no idea
[35:28] how developers make money with their own
[35:29] project. So you project so if you reach
[35:33] out to them on YouTube, Instagram, Tik
[35:34] Tok, you get a way bigger audience. It's
[35:37] like 10x the size of Twitter. And so you
[35:39] would have to find what you feel
[35:41] comfortable with. Um, for instance, if
[35:43] you're really good at making photos,
[35:44] like taking beautiful photos and writing
[35:46] a nice story, you can go on Instagram
[35:48] and tell your stories through photos.
[35:49] But if you're like a good with videos
[35:52] and you like to, you know, you like to
[35:54] edit videos, I like editing my own
[35:55] videos is fun. You can make a YouTube
[35:57] channel. It's slower than Twitter, but
[35:59] each videos has way more chance and way
[36:01] more um expansion that you would have on
[36:03] Twitter. Yeah, got it. So, that was the
[36:06] thing I wanted to know. Thanks for
[36:08] asking. Yeah.
[36:10] [Applause]
[36:14] Yes, sir.
[36:19] Just to follow up on his question.
[36:21] Sorry, I I couldn't hear you super well.
[36:22] Follow his question. Oh, the Oh, yeah.
[36:24] Sure, sure. Sure. You mentioned
[36:26] Instagram. Yeah.
[36:29] Yeah.
[36:32] I am 30 years old and I suck at YouTube
[36:35] shorts because I don't use it myself.
[36:39] I I tried a little bit. I think there's
[36:41] some guys crushing it. Maybe you guys
[36:43] have heard of Jack Freaks. He makes like
[36:45] short form content and he makes a lot of
[36:47] them and it's kind of similar to the way
[36:49] we do little startups. Like most of them
[36:52] will fail, but if one takes off, you can
[36:55] get lots of traffic. I think the
[36:57] downsides of shorts is you don't it's
[37:00] hard it's harder to build a brand that
[37:02] people really trust because you see it
[37:03] really quick and you move on. But for
[37:05] starting a project, I think this is a a
[37:07] killer way to, you know, get your first
[37:09] thousand visitors on the site.
[37:13] Where is it?
[37:18] Oh, that's a tricky one. Yeah. Is it?
[37:20] Oh, okay. I mean, you can scroll. Yeah.
[37:24] That's pretty fun. I do. We know how
[37:26] many questions have been asked. It's the
[37:29] whole In total, yeah, in total. I don't
[37:31] know. It's pretty fun.
[37:38] Uh, oh, that's a good one. Actually, a
[37:41] lot of indie people we see online prefer
[37:43] web apps over mobile apps. Why did you
[37:46] never give a go at mobile apps? From
[37:49] Mustafa. Do you have Mustafa? Yeah, come
[37:51] on in. Do we have
[37:54] a what's up? Hi. Hi. I'm good. Uh, thank
[37:58] you for first of all making your way all
[37:59] the way to Mumbai and hosting this
[38:00] meetup. So yeah, the question I had is I
[38:03] see a lot of these developers online,
[38:05] they have these huge web apps or they
[38:07] mostly prefer web apps. Is it because
[38:09] it's easier to set up, billing is
[38:12] simple, no review process or why is the
[38:14] reason why you've never ventured into
[38:15] making mobile apps? I think most
[38:18] developers have this like really desire
[38:20] for freedom and having someone reviewing
[38:22] your app and telling you no, no, no, you
[38:25] cannot pass the app store review there.
[38:27] There's a frustration inside of me that
[38:30] is like a how dare you saying me no.
[38:31] Yeah. Uh I actually I tried a few ones.
[38:35] I I have three apps on the stores.
[38:36] They're just tiny apps.
[38:39] Um I think this part like the the fact
[38:42] that it's as you say it's easier. Uh
[38:44] it's also it takes longer to ship your
[38:46] app. If it takes like two weeks to be
[38:48] reviewed from the app store, it's kind
[38:50] of a momentum killer. You want to be in
[38:52] the flow of you make a bunch of apps
[38:53] until one sticks. And if you have to
[38:55] wait for what do you do for two weeks
[38:57] you know like now that that's a myth
[38:59] that it takes two weeks at least now it
[39:01] takes one or two days at best so it's
[39:03] good but now that you have distribution
[39:04] setup so for instance Danny Postma he
[39:06] has headshot pro very successful product
[39:09] but not on the app store at all where
[39:11] most people would be more inclined to
[39:14] just posting their pictures and getting
[39:15] head shot or something. I want to know
[39:17] why would a developer like Peter Levels
[39:19] also has cracked it. People would
[39:21] probably be wanting a more mobile
[39:22] friendly app of his or something. So why
[39:25] would they never think of making a
[39:26] mobile app out of it? I think this is
[39:28] about to change right now. There are
[39:30] multiple reasons as you said it's much
[39:31] easier to make a web app and like making
[39:35] an app for iOS and Android. If you
[39:37] either if you go native, you have to
[39:38] make two apps. And if you use erect
[39:40] native as the web developer, you have to
[39:41] learn a new
[39:42] language, but and also the the app store
[39:45] payments, they they get like a 30% cut,
[39:48] but you're getting zero dollars anyway
[39:50] on it, right? So if it's like at least
[39:53] you make money and you still give 30%,
[39:55] it's fine than making no money, right?
[39:56] Oh, yeah. No, no. I mean, honestly, I'm
[39:58] with you 100%. I think it used to be a
[40:00] time where it was hard and you know, now
[40:02] there are two things that are happening.
[40:03] The first one is AI. So it's much easier
[40:05] to build a mobile app. The second one is
[40:07] like you've seen guys the Apple news
[40:09] like they got they lost the lawsuit. So
[40:12] now you can have a stripe link to your
[40:13] app which is absolutely amazing. I think
[40:15] there will be much more apps made from
[40:17] indies because of that and I think
[40:20] you're right and this is an untapped
[40:22] segment and I think there's a huge
[40:24] opportunity for indies. You just take an
[40:25] app that's working on the web and you
[40:26] make it as a web app. Yeah cuz I've been
[40:28] an indie dev on mobile for like uh 6
[40:31] years now or 5 years I don't remember.
[40:32] So I've been full-time indie dev. Now I
[40:35] have a small company. So I have a small
[40:36] indie studio. So we make indie apps
[40:38] ourselves. And what we've done is we've
[40:40] always focused on mobile. We've never
[40:42] thought let's make a web app because
[40:44] distributing a web app is tough because
[40:46] people on the internet are not really
[40:48] searching for products and on mobile
[40:51] people are like hey let me find my task
[40:52] manager, let me find my calendar app and
[40:55] all of these things, right? So, I always
[40:56] thought mobile was the way to go. And
[40:59] seeing people making these web apps for
[41:01] all things that could be mobile apps.
[41:03] Like I'm Danny makes a lot of money, but
[41:05] I know a lot of other headshot tools on
[41:07] mobile making a lot more money. Yeah.
[41:09] Right. So, why wouldn't he want to jump
[41:11] on to that action and be the guy on the
[41:13] web? So, that was my main confusion.
[41:15] We're going to pass a message to Denny
[41:16] Posar right here watching the stream.
[41:18] Why are you not making a mobile app?
[41:20] We'll probably question him on Twitter.
[41:21] Yeah. Perfect. Awesome. That's it's I
[41:23] think it's a really good point. I think
[41:24] if you're considering joining on the
[41:26] journey, consider making mobile apps
[41:28] because it's easier than ever because
[41:30] now Apple doesn't get a cut on on it.
[41:32] And as you said, technically only in the
[41:34] US though, but isn't it where most of
[41:36] the money comes from? Yeah, that's true.
[41:38] 90% of the revenue is America. Okay,
[41:41] that's it. Thank you so much. That's a
[41:42] good man. Thanks.
[41:43] [Music]
[41:52] Oh, maybe this one is I think it's a
[41:54] good one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. The
[41:56] name is Rish Risha. Rishab H. Rishab.
[42:00] Oh, maybe I should the question. What
[42:02] advice would you give to someone
[42:04] launching their first startup today
[42:06] while having a 9 to5?
[42:09] Rishab H. Is Richab on the room with us?
[42:13] Come on here.
[42:16] What's the man? Nice.
[42:19] Yeah.
[42:21] Okay. So, what's your 925? Uh my 925 is
[42:24] basically being a software engineer uh
[42:26] at Insure Tech. So right now I'm
[42:28] planning to like previously I was uh
[42:31] building uh like AI voice agents uh
[42:34] previous in my previous work uh but
[42:36] right now I wanted to continue it as my
[42:38] own venture but having let's say
[42:41] financial constraints such as student
[42:43] debts or anything like parents or
[42:45] something. So in that case how I'm
[42:48] supposed to like break through uh and
[42:50] having like uh someone just mentioned
[42:52] earlier like h uh even if uh we don't
[42:55] have uh like distribution while I let's
[42:58] say I have built a product I I want to
[43:00] distribute in the Twitter as well I
[43:02] don't have much of followers so in that
[43:05] case how I'm supposed to crack that out
[43:09] okay how much do you like how much free
[43:11] time do you have uh let's say four or
[43:14] five hours per day. Okay. You work from
[43:18] home? Yes. Okay. This is this is really
[43:20] good. Okay.
[43:21] Um I think I think it's it's it comes
[43:25] down to your personal preference whether
[43:26] or not you should quit your job or not.
[43:28] Yeah. Like some people first some people
[43:31] live with very few money and they do
[43:33] well. Some people are more frugal and
[43:35] they need more money. So it really
[43:37] depends on how you feel. And also if you
[43:39] make lots of money you can also have the
[43:41] stress of not making enough money. So
[43:43] it's, you know, it's like it's really
[43:44] inside of your head to make this
[43:46] decision or not whether you should quit
[43:48] your 9 to5. I think it has been proven
[43:50] now the community is big and we've seen
[43:52] lots of people that you can make it as a
[43:54] solo like full-time entrepreneur or as a
[43:58] part-time like 9 to5 building on the
[44:00] side on weekends. Um I think Tony Din if
[44:03] I'm not mistaken where he started he was
[44:06] like on part-time which is a big maker.
[44:09] So like it's you know like there are a
[44:10] bunch of people who made it on both uh
[44:12] sites. So I wouldn't you know if you I
[44:15] would really let your heart speak and
[44:17] decide or not if it's worth quitting the
[44:18] job. Let's say I'm uh doing it uh having
[44:21] both on the sides. Uh but in that case
[44:24] uh how I can crack it while having the
[44:27] distribution.
[44:29] The distribution I think it's it does
[44:32] it's not something that you can you know
[44:34] have or not have. I think it come with
[44:35] the time and you will get it based on
[44:37] the hours you put in. I think in the end
[44:39] the the journey is always the same. You
[44:41] want to make stuff, you want to get
[44:42] people's attention and then you grow a
[44:44] tiny audience which give you a tiny
[44:45] distribution and then you repeat repeat
[44:47] repeat and at some point one will take
[44:49] off and then you will have a more like
[44:51] like higher leverage with a bigger
[44:53] distribution at this time. Um but again
[44:56] distribution is you know like what I do
[44:59] mostly with Twitter and stuff. It's like
[45:00] a social media but you have tons of
[45:02] other distribution channel. I made my
[45:04] first internet dollar with cold emails.
[45:07] It's boring. Really boring as
[45:09] Takes time as well. Yeah. But but it's
[45:11] much easier and you have way higher uh
[45:13] return on investment early because right
[45:16] now you could go go back sit and send a
[45:18] cold email and within 15 minutes you
[45:20] could have tested your idea. That's is
[45:22] much easier to do that than building an
[45:24] audience. An audience on the long term
[45:26] it gives you like it's a massive asset
[45:28] is really good. But you can start with a
[45:29] cold email and actually knowing that you
[45:31] have limited time, I'll probably give it
[45:34] a try to like have those either ads or
[45:36] cold emails channels that are like that
[45:39] makes sense. Yeah. Okay. Thank you so
[45:40] much. Welcome. Thank you so much.
[45:43] [Applause]
[45:54] Should we go take Huh?
[45:58] Maybe this one. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. How?
[46:00] Yeah. Because the take. Yeah. Read tap
[46:03] tap refer. That's interesting. How do
[46:04] you manage so many things like shipping
[46:06] projects, YouTube, fitness, meetup and
[46:09] whatnot? What
[46:11] not? It was from it's not a named who
[46:15] asked this question here. I'm not sure
[46:17] this
[46:19] is okay. I don't think we have the
[46:21] person who has the question because
[46:22] there was no name. But it's okay. I can
[46:25] Okay. Tap reapfer. Tap refer. Yeah. Oh,
[46:28] I think I know it's a software, huh? Do
[46:30] you guys know tap refer? Oh, yeah. Okay.
[46:33] Okay. I don't know how this this
[46:34] question come, but it seems legit. So,
[46:37] um, how do you manage to do stuff? It's
[46:40] I think I think time management is
[46:42] mostly prior priorities. There used to
[46:46] be a time where shipping lots of app was
[46:48] my number one priority and that's how I
[46:50] made so many. And so I would wake up in
[46:52] the morning, I would have one goal is to
[46:54] ship something by the end of the day or
[46:56] by the end of the week. Uh now things
[46:59] change a little bit and f uh like health
[47:02] becomes another new priority. So like
[47:05] starting the day with a workout also
[47:07] becomes my number one priority. So
[47:08] there's not a single day where I skip a
[47:10] workout. And so you know like this this
[47:14] is how you this is I manage my time
[47:15] because I I want to achieve the number
[47:17] one priority and it just comes with the
[47:20] time. They It's hard to show how it was
[47:24] before, but things were much more
[47:26] chaotic than they were now. And things
[47:28] right now are also much more chaotic
[47:30] than what I show on on Twitter and
[47:32] YouTube. Um there's no, you know, like
[47:35] there's nothing perfect. There's no
[47:36] illusion of a perfect day where I crush
[47:38] six hours of work and everything
[47:39] imperfect. I'm happy. I eat healthy.
[47:42] Yeah. Like there's always a little bit
[47:44] like a Yeah, there's always a little bit
[47:45] of hard part during the day, struggles,
[47:48] unhappiness, and all that. So uh yeah I
[47:50] guess it's a constant battle. I don't
[47:51] think it really goes away. I don't think
[47:53] there's a secret source. I think it
[47:54] matters really on what you know what you
[47:56] really want to achieve and the priority
[47:57] the schedule the the productivity will
[48:00] come with it.
[48:02] Good. Okay.
[48:07] Maybe we do one more. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[48:10] So what is it? Our patch. Our patch.
[48:15] The patch. Oh, what is it?
[48:18] Oh, do you want to come?
[48:23] Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah, I'll be happy to do
[48:26] that, but at the end of the meet up.
[48:27] Okay. No, it's actually it'll be fun
[48:29] here. Yeah. I mean, in short, uh I mean,
[48:32] it's up to you. Okay, guys. I think it'd
[48:34] be fun.
[48:36] We We do.
[48:38] Okay. Okay. Let's make a vote. It's up
[48:41] to you guys. How about pitching a
[48:42] startup live? Raise your hand if you
[48:44] want to do it or you prefer to do it at
[48:46] the
[48:47] end. Okay, we have a mixing. Okay, we'll
[48:49] we'll do it. We'll do it at the end.
[48:50] Okay. Yeah.
[48:53] Okay.
[48:55] Um Oh, okay. This Yeah, Shakib. Okay. I
[48:59] have two ideas in my mind and I am
[49:00] always confused about the audience.
[49:03] Should I start should I start finding
[49:05] people or users initially for my own
[49:07] country or globally or should I first
[49:10] launch
[49:11] it? Huh? So was it was the name was
[49:14] Shakib. Do we have Shakib here?
[49:17] Oh yeah, man. Come on in.
[49:22] What's up? Nice to meet you. Nice to
[49:24] meet you too. So um I'm a beginner. I'm
[49:27] a self developer at I'm 17 and I'm
[49:30] building I have two mind I mean I have
[49:33] two ideas in my mind. One is a idea
[49:35] smash app a web app. Basically you can
[49:38] just come and post your ideas and then
[49:41] see who likes it and you know you know
[49:43] sometimes you you are confused that our
[49:45] ideas are not good or bad you know and
[49:49] we come to people and say no I pitched
[49:52] our idea you know and people just rate
[49:54] it it's good or bad so I'm just making
[49:56] an uh social media app in which you can
[49:59] just post your ideas and get get a like
[50:02] or fl basically we have two options hate
[50:05] it or flop it Okay, just like and
[50:08] dislike. Okay. So yeah, this is one idea
[50:11] and one idea is creating a social
[50:13] platform for basically exclusively for
[50:16] coders and techy peoples in which we can
[50:20] have fun you know we have LinkedIn but
[50:22] it's professional we have Instagram but
[50:24] it's for it's just for fun for everyone
[50:26] there's no any social media platform for
[50:29] specifically for coders you know so my
[50:33] main question is uh what should I do I
[50:36] should find the I mean audience audience
[50:38] the peoples who will going to register
[50:40] to my uh platform first. I should find
[50:43] audience first or I should just uh
[50:46] launch it first and then wait for
[50:47] audience. Okay. I think you have two uh
[50:51] two great ideas. I think the first one I
[50:54] would make it ASAP and launch it ASAP.
[50:56] Don't care about the users just make it
[50:58] this is something that anyone can
[51:00] understand. Make it in a way that can go
[51:03] viral. Um this is again take my like
[51:06] take my words with a pinch of salt. I
[51:08] don't think you will be able to make
[51:09] money from this, but you will be able to
[51:11] go viral and you would use that to grow
[51:14] your audience. It's fun. Like pinch it
[51:17] or leave it or whatever you come up
[51:18] with. Like there's a, you know, kind of
[51:20] like Tinder for ideas. There's a, you
[51:22] know, you can get something here that
[51:24] can go viral that people can relate and
[51:26] you add a link to your Twitter or
[51:28] whatever this is you're building on and
[51:30] people will follow you and like, oh,
[51:31] this guy is cool. Like he has fun ideas.
[51:33] It's fun. It will also teach you about
[51:35] launching platforms like product hunts
[51:36] and you know a bunch of you know those
[51:38] launch platforms. So you're going to
[51:39] level up your skills using that. And
[51:42] then your second idea I think like
[51:44] you're like a like social media
[51:46] marketplace it's more advanced. So I
[51:48] would do it
[51:50] after I would I would probably
[51:54] it's I don't know I I think you if you
[51:58] you want for these kind of ideas you
[51:59] want to start with your friends. You
[52:01] want to have a little group of friends
[52:02] who are similar and would use your app
[52:05] not just because you made it but because
[52:07] they need it. Cuz a social media can go
[52:09] really big but it's also really hard to
[52:11] create another social media because now
[52:12] we have Twitter, uh YouTube, Instagram,
[52:14] Tik Tok and so it's it's also you know
[52:16] like going on and switching for another
[52:18] social media that's a lot of work as a
[52:20] user too. So you really need to to solve
[52:22] a specific thing for people because I
[52:24] think a social media for developer is
[52:26] big. There are like millions of
[52:27] developers across the world. So you
[52:29] might want to find like for developers
[52:30] who built on this platform or something
[52:33] like this like really specific social
[52:35] media for developer I I think it's white
[52:37] but again take with a pinch of salt
[52:39] because I have seen project that I
[52:42] thought were stupid and they took off
[52:44] and the same time you know like it's
[52:45] it's a ideas are are not that important.
[52:50] It's how you execute on this idea. How
[52:52] you turn it into like a final product
[52:54] that matters the most. So build both.
[52:57] Start with the easy one first. go viral,
[52:59] grow an audience, and launch the second
[53:00] one. Thanks.
[53:06] [Applause]
[53:08] Okay, so it was the first time. Wow. Oh,
[53:13] okay. Didn't expect to see that. That's
[53:14] a bunch of people. Um, it's the first
[53:16] time I do this kind of like a fireside
[53:20] chat. I hope you guys liked it. It was
[53:23] fun. Now we're going to move on to the
[53:25] next one where I'm going to get my
[53:28] controller right here and we're going to
[53:30] this is something I call debug master
[53:31] startup. It's basically we're going to
[53:32] form groups of like five people. So
[53:35] you're going to meet you're going to be
[53:36] with five people. Every five minutes one
[53:39] person will introduce their project and
[53:41] ask one problem they struggle with. So
[53:44] um we've had like you know which of my
[53:46] ideas should I work on? You can share
[53:48] that share it quickly so people
[53:50] understand what you're working on and
[53:51] then the other four will try to help
[53:52] you. And then every five minutes I'll
[53:54] say in the m with a mic you're going to
[53:56] rotate. Someone else will ask a question
[53:58] and the other four are going to help him
[54:00] or her. And we're going to do that for
[54:01] five minutes. So one person will get to
[54:03] five minutes to ask their problems and
[54:04] the rest of the time you guys will be
[54:06] help try to help a person. Sound
[54:09] good? Okay. Okay. So what you can do is
[54:13] you can just scatter around the room. We
[54:14] have the entire space. So just move
[54:16] around like um you know meet with your
[54:19] neighbor like ask questions um and try
[54:21] to find group of five. I'll give you one
[54:23] minute to find five people and then
[54:26] we're going to start the
[54:27] timer. All right. Run around. Go left.
[54:31] Go right. Turn.
[54:35] Is it okay? Yeah.
[54:42] I know.
[54:52] Okay, I think we are
[55:00] I think
[55:01] they're okay. I'll have
[55:04] to I think I give this just one more
[55:07] minute.
[55:22] Okay, guys. If you struggle for space,
[55:24] there's a little bit of space here.
[55:39] Okay.
[55:44] Okay. So, we are going to start in five,
[55:48] four, 3, two, one. Go ahead. One person
[55:53] ask a question and try to help this
[55:58] person. How did we do? How did we do?
[56:02] Okay. Yeah.
[56:03] Yeah. Sure. Sure. That's a fun one.
[56:06] Yeah. So, we have All right. Nice. Who
[56:08] wants to start?
[56:09] Uh yes. So basically I have a
[56:21] like President
[56:47] [Music]
[56:59] It's like a you have a banner that is
[57:01] consistent. You can like it's like a
[57:02] piece of code I can put everywhere.
[57:04] Yeah. Like basically what user
[57:44] That's
[58:04] why I think in your case uh Because in
[58:08] this case, what you want is you if you
[58:09] want to validate an idea, you want
[58:11] people to pay for it. It's only valid.
[58:13] Like it's easy for me to put a like
[58:14] because I like you and I like your idea.
[58:17] But now putting my credit cards and
[58:18] paying for your ideas for his idea, it's
[58:21] another type of validation. I think in
[58:23] this case, in your case, you want you
[58:24] want people to use your app. Yes. How do
[58:26] you monetize? What is your pricing like?
[58:28] Uh like there there are multiple
[58:30] templates for like multiple designs
[58:32] basically. One one design will be free
[58:34] and other will be paid. Okay. Why are
[58:37] you doing this? Because I think people
[58:41] people need consistent branding like
[58:43] they don't have a particular brand brand
[58:45] or identity.
[59:03] [Music]
[59:18] Do you have any specific segment of
[59:19] people you want to target? Are you like
[59:21] companies, entrepreneurs, developers,
[59:24] students? Yes, indie hackers.
[59:28] Okay. It's a raw feedback.
[59:30] I think it's hard to make money with
[59:32] that because it's like a vitamin. it
[59:35] falls in the vitamin category. And so
[59:37] it's a nice thing. Now, if I'm starting,
[59:40] if I'm getting started, I don't have a
[59:42] lot of money, I'm going to invest my
[59:43] money only on things where I know it's
[59:45] going to double the revenue. And so, in
[59:47] your case, I would rather do it myself
[59:50] than take the time to understand your
[59:52] product, eventually pay and do it with
[59:54] your service. So I think either what you
[59:57] can do is you can you can target like
[59:59] bigger companies who have lots of money
[60:01] and then yes in this case like
[60:03] consistent branding for instance like
[60:04] you have those like AI head shot you
[60:06] know like a company right where they
[60:08] have like all blue background or they're
[60:09] all professional or they all look all
[60:11] casual all you know Indian style or
[60:13] whatever then in this case it makes
[60:15] sense because they're a company so they
[60:16] have lots of money and they struggle
[60:18] really with it because if they want to
[60:20] change the branding of like their team
[60:22] page they need to change the photo of
[60:24] person A person B person C and then in
[60:26] this case you solve it's not a vitamin
[60:28] you solve like an actual problem. Okay,
[60:31] that would be my takeaway. Yeah, you
[60:33] guys have a take away. Yeah, I think he
[60:35] need to start.
[61:30] makers, but companies very different. If
[61:31] you go for that, I think cold emails is
[61:34] definitely one of the number one thing
[61:35] you can do. This with SEO and just call
[61:38] outreach in general, I think would work.
[61:40] Also, how much does it cost?
[61:59] Yeah. And usually it's very professional
[62:01] and stuff. Yeah. Worth giving a try.
[62:04] Okay. Okay. You guys want to you guys
[62:06] want to rotate? I have a question. I
[62:09] asked for the pen. Okay. What is your
[62:12] what what are you building and what do
[62:13] you struggle with? Actually want to show
[62:14] it because it's lowkey a funny. I made
[62:16] it all the way here. The ultimate pitch
[62:18] is like you fund my runway and I quit
[62:20] tomorrow. That is the gist of it and
[62:23] I'll give you like what the product does
[62:25] and what the other two ideas are. So
[62:27] like 6 month run and the one product is
[62:29] already ready. It's an AI video and I'll
[62:31] be targeting companies with it. I need
[62:33] your like mentorship like for 6 months
[62:36] to explain to me how like this dynamic
[62:38] works, how do I price this, how do I uh
[62:41] like basically I'll be doing everything.
[62:42] I just want your input. Is this correct?
[62:44] Is this the way to go about it or not? I
[62:46] think it's a good place for you to share
[62:47] your ideas with the group. So the idea
[62:49] is basically an AI video. You put in a
[62:52] prompt, you give it a screen, you give
[62:53] it whatever you want. You can literally
[62:55] give it like one word like World War II
[62:57] inflatable tanks. That would be a prompt
[62:59] and create an entire video with a voice
[63:01] over with images with videos with
[63:03] captions all of it. Right now I'm
[63:05] working on like custom
[63:08] updation. So you can literally get give
[63:11] one image and it'll integrate the
[63:12] product in the story. So it'll also
[63:14] create the story and integrate the
[63:16] actual product in the story and then
[63:17] custom avatars can create infinite
[63:19] avatars. And these are the two things
[63:21] that most AI video editors are not
[63:22] doing. And the reason for me to like
[63:23] venture to you for your mentorship as
[63:25] well as the runway is when I started
[63:27] this I was ahead of the curve but now I
[63:29] see all the features that I have all the
[63:30] AI video that they just have thoseh
[63:34] features but now I want to like you know
[63:37] get ahead of that. So for that why have
[63:39] you launched your first idea? Uh no you
[63:42] have to launch it man. Yeah. Otherwise
[63:44] this is what you're doing. You know
[63:44] you're jumping onto the next one. No I'm
[63:46] not jumping. It's like building feature
[63:48] onto it. I need the runway to launch the
[63:49] idea. That's the thing. I've tried
[63:51] building it with my corporate job with
[63:53] everything. It's not working out.
[63:55] You really got to launch it. That's very
[63:57] I think especially now it's like it's
[63:59] booming right. Yeah exactly. I was ahead
[64:01] of the curve and now I'm behind the
[64:02] curve. So that's why I need to like get
[64:04] ahead of the curve and then launch it
[64:05] again. I think we I'll be launching it
[64:07] within the first week anyway, but I'll
[64:08] be working on the uh like in the first
[64:11] month. So, I'll launch it in the first
[64:13] week and then keep iterating on it. So,
[64:16] I like take the lead. Yeah. I I think
[64:18] you're we're still way ahead of the
[64:20] curve. Like the AI like you don't see
[64:22] good AI video, right? Images are getting
[64:25] really good. I'm already using that
[64:28] videos are really bad. All videos are
[64:30] really bad. So, I think you got you got
[64:32] something now. You're going to put it
[64:33] outside. That's what I was saying. And
[64:34] the pitch is actually funny. That's why
[64:35] I wanted to like to show it to everyone
[64:37] as well. Yeah. And I have two more ideas
[64:39] and that I'll be building in these 6
[64:41] months time only. One of them is you
[64:42] guys have heard of portions
[64:45] right? So no do you know like 3D uh
[64:48] scans photoggramometry. So the concept
[64:51] of that is have you guys played
[64:54] clubmanropica any of the games massively
[64:57] multiplayer role playing games or the
[64:58] fighting ones? Browser based online
[65:00] games. Have you played any games?
[65:02] Runescape. No, I haven't. I heard that.
[65:04] You know, you know what it is, right?
[65:06] It's like a multiplayer online role
[65:07] playing game. So, the idea here is this
[65:09] is a mobile based game. You basically
[65:11] scan yourself in 3D and then you have a
[65:12] 3D car of yourself and then you are in
[65:14] this RPG world which is a mobile based
[65:16] game and then you chat with people. You
[65:18] play mini games and yeah that is one
[65:20] idea. The other idea is celebrity
[65:22] combat. He has so many ideas and he has
[65:24] to shift.
[65:26] Yeah, we have to make him shift and that
[65:28] is the pitch. I need to shift. I need
[65:30] your help. I need your ship. That's the
[65:31] pitch. Yeah. You want sgest from all of
[65:33] us or just No, I want sgest from all
[65:37] mentorship
[65:39] from you know, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[65:43] Oh I totally forgot. I I'm also a
[65:45] YouTuber. I also make content. I also
[65:46] need to go on that. I do that. Yeah. We
[65:50] obviously like I had a in
[65:55] a try to show it to people like not
[65:59] because he made those product because
[66:02] the reason for me to pitch is because I
[66:04] want to be I don't have the time to be I
[66:07] don't have the money to be I like
[66:11] you have too many ideas if you scatter
[66:13] all of it then you will think about lot
[66:15] of one idea only the AI like I an entire
[66:19] road map. I'm not scattering myself.
[66:21] Like even this the ideas came after you
[66:23] cutting down like 100 ideas. That's
[66:27] how you have to give yourself a
[66:28] deadline. That's the deadline. You get
[66:30] rid of the project and you move on to
[66:31] the next one.
[66:34] I need to launch it. You got to make a
[66:35] amendment. You have to commit to one
[66:37] deadline with the group. So say it out
[66:40] loud. I will finish. I will
[66:42] quit and launch my products as soon as
[66:45] possible. No.
[66:47] We
[66:48] need 20 as soon as possible. What date?
[66:51] What? What date is it? First launch.
[66:54] Which date? Give us give us Yeah. 14th
[66:57] of May. 14th May. Yeah. 14th May works.
[67:00] Just the website, not the back end
[67:01] connected. Okay. Maybe a back end with
[67:03] like one prompt. Maybe the back end.
[67:04] It's coming again. Maybe the back end
[67:06] with one prompt. You can like No, you
[67:08] have a link on May 14th. You have a
[67:09] link. People can do whatever. Do
[67:12] whatever. They can sign up. They can I
[67:13] get their emails and if they email me
[67:15] the prompt I send them the videos. It's
[67:17] up to you. But you will be you have to
[67:18] be public about the Yes. Yes. Yes. I'll
[67:19] be Yeah. You sign one week. Yeah. You
[67:21] sign May 14th.
[67:23] I'll do you even better. May 14th. You
[67:25] you set a deadline for May 14th and you
[67:27] you know what you you send me a DM and
[67:30] you show me the project. How about not
[67:32] even 14th? 12th May. Next Monday. 12th
[67:35] May works too. Okay. Dill. Okay. E 12th
[67:38] of May. I should have recorded
[67:40] this. I recorded this. He's the guy with
[67:41] the GoPro. I all recorded and all
[67:43] remember
[67:45] how does this question okay if you were
[67:48] 18 today would you choose to go to
[67:50] college or go all in in AI right now
[67:54] it's a tough one because I'm not a
[67:56] parents so I don't know like I know
[67:58] especially in India parents are like
[67:59] really care about their kids I'm 18
[68:00] that's why I'm asking what should I do
[68:02] right now like because I'm getting
[68:04] confused because I have to go to college
[68:07] and pursue the CS degree and I'm working
[68:09] on apps and ideas so what should I do
[68:12] like should I go all in in AI or because
[68:15] I feel like I'm missing out on this
[68:17] context do both you can actually show to
[68:21] people if you get the traction if you
[68:23] have the money you can opt out if you
[68:25] want if your problem is not having
[68:27] enough network you should definitely
[68:29] pursue college that way you can build
[68:30] network
[68:33] I I think I I just finished I think you
[68:37] as you say like you could do both I
[68:40] think you are here on a Sunday
[68:41] afternoon. This is not like you're not
[68:43] just playing around getting drunk with
[68:45] your friends. You're here because of a
[68:46] reason. I would follow that. And so I'll
[68:49] probably go and follow my passion for
[68:51] AI. In the worst case, you can still go
[68:52] university at 19. Yeah, that's one way
[68:54] of do it. Thank you. That's good. I for
[68:57] you.
[69:01] I came from all the way just to Okay. I
[69:04] just finished 9 years ago. Okay. Okay.
[69:07] So we made this project uh while in like
[69:10] uh space season 5 and
[69:14] there I'm actually M uh we we are both
[69:18] oh sh Oh man yeah so we we did like 600
[69:24] in gross revenue till now 630 but I
[69:27] don't know how to develop this more like
[69:29] what features to add and uh like how to
[69:33] grow this is just abandoned right now
[69:35] this is just staying and we are not
[69:37] working on it. Okay. And you want to
[69:39] give it the second life. Why do you want
[69:42] to give it the second life? Um because I
[69:44] I see the potential. Um at the time I
[69:47] had two people working with me. They
[69:50] were helping on the code side.
[69:53] I
[70:03] don't college.
[70:06] Okay. So now with one of my friends or
[70:11] in
[70:12] person that's a good story. So like I
[70:15] don't know what features to add now like
[70:17] how to develop this company. How does it
[70:18] work? How do I use your product to go
[70:20] viral? So this is like you can paste in
[70:24] any YouTube video. So this was just the
[70:26] first prototype. You can paste in any
[70:28] YouTube video like Neville's video and
[70:30] you will get like 10 or 20 short post
[70:33] that you can post over time to build
[70:35] your personal brand to to be active on X
[70:38] and to be active on X and to get the
[70:41] eyeballs to your profile and then to
[70:42] your product. So this is my vision. You
[70:45] extract shorts. Yeah. And you make we
[70:48] extract YouTube videos and we make and
[70:51] short short post on Twitter. Okay,
[70:54] thanks. So like can I show you right
[70:56] now? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Just one second.
[71:01] So basically I will give you a link.
[71:02] You'll give me a uh I'll give you a
[71:04] YouTube link and you will extract those
[71:06] the um I mean the transcription and then
[71:10] uh the back end will process it. I mean
[71:12] no it's normal prompt. Okay. Yeah. You
[71:14] create shorts with AI. No, kind of. No,
[71:16] it's not like a video creat.
[71:22] He doesn't create videos. You make a
[71:24] Twitter post. Okay. Yeah. Oh, okay. I
[71:26] see. If you want to create videos from
[71:30] long form, you can use Yeah. Yeah. I
[71:32] Yeah, that's why I was asking because I
[71:34] know there are a bunch of great tools.
[71:35] Yeah. ask really intimate
[71:38] question. Oh, that's a great one. So, so
[71:43] there is like um this one um share ask
[71:49] your uh Okay, let's let's do the
[71:52] mark. Let's do the mark. I I watch all
[71:55] the videos.
[71:57] Oh,
[71:58] videos
[72:00] live a while back. Okay. Okay.
[72:04] Yeah, about Zen voice. I think that was
[72:07] so so here I have portion of thread long
[72:10] post or short post. So I'll I'll opt in
[72:13] for long post
[72:18] and you're going to make a thread. Yeah.
[72:20] Just one single long post the new
[72:22] feature. Okay. You summarize the video
[72:23] where Okay. Yeah. Exactly. And how do
[72:26] you price at the moment? Um this is like
[72:28] $15 and
[72:30] $30. I mean the the pricing right now on
[72:33] the product. Okay. One time payment. No.
[72:37] Oh. $15 per month. Yeah. Per month
[72:39] subscription. Okay. We have right now um
[72:43] like $30 a month. Okay. Okay. So, what I
[72:47] would do I think the monthly recurring
[72:49] revenue makes sense. What I would do is
[72:51] the Jack Freak strategy. Okay. Yeah.
[72:53] Jack. So you you you want to show
[72:56] that this works for someone who is not
[73:00] even on Twitter. You want to basically
[73:03] show that you can grow a Twitter account
[73:04] from zero to a,000 followers using just
[73:07] your app. Like kind of you see on
[73:09] YouTube videos those like those videos
[73:10] that says like oh I made $1,000 with a
[73:13] faceless YouTube channel. You want to be
[73:15] the person who create those YouTube
[73:17] those Twitter accounts and you want to
[73:18] be able to go from zero to 1,000
[73:20] followers just using mostly using your
[73:22] tool and show that you see guys it's so
[73:24] easy I just pass YouTube videos I create
[73:25] threads I publish them on Twitter and I
[73:27] get 1,000 followers after a month then
[73:30] it's like it's connected to a vision
[73:32] it's connected to exactly like a goal
[73:34] people want that and you show like hey
[73:35] you know I don't even have a personal
[73:36] branding but I can use this product to
[73:39] get a th000 followers and then you know
[73:40] thousand followers is something that
[73:41] people say so you can get from zero to
[73:43] a,000 followers in I don't know 30 days
[73:46] or something. This is like a big selling
[73:48] point for people.
[73:50] So, uh I just took this video of yours
[73:54] and this is the post like can you can
[73:56] you read the book and and like can you
[73:57] give any rating from 1 to 10?
[74:04] This is good man. You can you can you
[74:05] can I think it's it's it's good way good
[74:09] enough. Super simple prototype. It
[74:11] doesn't matter. That's the goal. It's
[74:12] like super simple. You want a link and
[74:14] you give me a tweet and eventually a
[74:16] button for me to publish it or at least
[74:17] copy and and push it. What's important
[74:20] here is you want success stories and you
[74:22] have to be the first user who can go
[74:24] from zero to,000 followers to make this
[74:26] product. True. And you want to show that
[74:27] anyone can do it. Like kind of you want
[74:29] to play like oh I'm just a dumb guy you
[74:31] know I just input this and I get that
[74:32] out and it works. If you're able to show
[74:34] that then people be like oh wow that's
[74:36] amazing. and they want to try to that
[74:37] way in this like journey of trying to go
[74:40] from zero to a th00and from zero like
[74:42] really from zero you're going to learn
[74:43] stuff you're going to improve the
[74:44] product for yourself because you'll be
[74:45] like oh okay now I realize I need to
[74:47] schedule the tweets in the US time zone
[74:49] oh I need to update how the tweets are
[74:50] written and stuff so you're going to
[74:52] make yourself you're going to make the
[74:53] product better by using it and then in
[74:55] the end you have case studies like oh
[74:56] this is working look I did it for me I
[74:58] did it for this random guy and try to
[75:00] get once you get a bit of momentum try
[75:02] to get two or three or five people to
[75:04] get in the journey with you because If
[75:06] you also have people who have results
[75:07] like I did with ship pass, it worked
[75:09] because some people like, "Oh, I I
[75:10] shipped my app in like two days or
[75:11] something." You want to get that true
[75:13] and so start with you. Show that it
[75:15] works and then bring people over.
[75:17] Pleasure. Thank you. Yeah. Pleasure.
[75:18] Yeah.
[75:20] Yeah. I I'll just go real quick and then
[75:23] we're good. So, I used to watch your
[75:25] streams and I've been with you for a
[75:27] year. Yeah. So, I made this website.
[75:31] Okay.
[75:39] I mean this is a good and the marketing
[75:43] strategy I've been using is using Tik
[75:45] Toks even though it's when in India I'm
[75:47] using BPA and okay and
[75:50] Instagram and from that I've generated
[75:53] $300 but it's really hard to make
[75:56] content like every day I have to
[75:58] post that Tik Tok Tik Tok. So how do you
[76:01] make you make your product makes Tik
[76:02] Tok? How does it work? No. So, first of
[76:04] all, a user comes, a student comes and
[76:07] he uploads his PDFs, for example, his
[76:10] college PDFs like for a subject he's
[76:12] studying. He can upload YouTube videos,
[76:14] he can upload article URL. Yeah. And AI
[76:18] will extract all the text from it and
[76:21] generate quizzes and flash cards from it
[76:23] that they can scroll. See here. So, it's
[76:26] a learning platform. See, it's just like
[76:29] but it speaks to us.
[76:32] Oh, that's okay.
[76:35] [Music]
[76:37] That's cool. That's I think you got uh
[76:40] how how did you get the first you said
[76:43] $300?
[76:44] How did you get it? Like how what how
[76:48] was your what was your marketing and who
[76:49] paying? So first of all, I said on
[76:52] Reddit and I got 600 ups. Three two
[76:55] posts were viral and most first I kept
[76:59] it free. So the students tried it and
[77:01] gave me feedback and I improved a lot.
[77:20] So you have
[77:23] one
[77:33] [Music]
[77:35] $7. So that's how I
[77:39] like I like it.
[77:46] So it's very hard for me to
[77:48] make
[77:52] another. So you just upload
[77:55] your
[77:57] videos. This is only for people who are
[78:02] [Music]
[78:08] in very
[78:13] You
[78:14] just like the
[78:17] video for
[78:19] me and you
[78:28] just
[78:30] are
[78:32] you
[78:34] just and then this is the
[78:37] platform and AI added all these captions
[78:43] Okay. I think in your
[78:47] case I think you would say the same
[78:49] strategy
[78:50] as it's exactly the same. This only is
[78:54] valuable for people if you're able to
[78:55] show that it
[78:57] works. So and what when I mean it works
[79:00] it means it has an outcome like a real
[79:02] outcome for people. The same as Jack's
[79:04] strategy. It works because you was able
[79:06] to prove that using his stories he was
[79:08] able to drive millions of people on
[79:09] autopilot and so I think I would go back
[79:12] to your previous app and use this on top
[79:14] of your previous app and try to get so
[79:17] much the results right yeah and yeah
[79:20] exactly I haven't launched it yet I just
[79:22] completed coding it uh yesterday Oh nice
[79:25] congrats yeah I made it in like a month
[79:28] it was very complicated because
[79:30] rendering hundreds of videos at the same
[79:32] time
[79:33] it's very complicated So I use AWS
[79:35] Lambda. So it can scale infinitely.
[79:38] Okay. And in only 5 minutes it can
[79:41] generate 100. That's cool man. I think
[79:43] if I was using VPS it would take me like
[79:46] 3 days or something because it's like
[79:49] it's like you one video after another
[79:51] but in Lambda all the like 400 lambdas
[79:55] are in go at the same time. That's good.
[79:56] Here you have to forget about your
[79:58] developer like we want to do that. I
[80:00] know me too. I'm the same. I'm very but
[80:02] remember that people using that will be
[80:03] students. So you want to make sure like
[80:05] I mean not the previous app you want to
[80:06] make sure you help those students get
[80:08] their learning materials and it works
[80:10] for them or at least you have and then
[80:11] you want to show that with that you're
[80:12] able to drive hundreds and thousands of
[80:14] visitors to this app. It doesn't matter
[80:16] if your previous app makes lots of money
[80:18] but you want to show you want to show
[80:19] that this is able to drive lots of
[80:21] visitors for any app using this and once
[80:25] you have this you're good running little
[80:27] time so we can resume 30 minutes
[80:30] already. Okay. So we can resume. Okay.
[80:33] Okay. Okay. You can call. Okay. I I'll
[80:36] get back to Okay, guys. I will you can
[80:38] talk about it. I we I just finished this
[80:41] and then we wrap and I will be back
[80:42] again. I promise. I promise we're going
[80:43] to have a chat after everything. Okay.
[80:47] Quick thing. Yeah. Same thing. I I I
[80:49] really sorry. I will be here. I just
[80:50] want to wrap you up now. I'll be here
[80:52] again. I promise we're going to chat.
[80:53] Yeah. I'll be around. Okay. Sure. Okay.
[80:56] Uh I wanted you to talk about like uh
[81:00] it's a bit vulnerable question because
[81:02] like uh you went from someone who worked
[81:04] at the cafe to being a visionary who can
[81:06] like have a freedom to like work from
[81:08] anywhere and like leave a life that
[81:10] makes other people inspire and want to
[81:12] change like how did that transition
[81:15] happen? Like what mindset uh shifts help
[81:17] you get there? Like most of us out here
[81:19] right now most of us are like at the
[81:21] bottom of that wealth dynamic and like a
[81:24] beginning. So like I really want to
[81:27] understand it like I have been doing
[81:28] indirecting from like a 6 years
[81:29] something. Uh I have not made much but
[81:32] like my life was little so it was enough
[81:34] for me but like right now I'm a lot more
[81:37] and I want to understand where to get to
[81:39] that that top of like being a visionary
[81:41] level like and I'm I'm at the paycheck
[81:44] to paycheck kind of type of person at
[81:45] this point. So like I think it will
[81:47] come. I think it will it's
[81:50] a I think it's you know it's like a
[81:52] steps like Yeah. I think it's a matter
[81:55] of like show like showing off doing your
[81:57] own thing. I know it's it's hard. Yeah.
[82:00] But it will always be hard like no
[82:02] matter what stage you are you will have
[82:04] always problems. When you make more
[82:05] money you will wonder like oh I struggle
[82:07] with stacks and system and then when you
[82:09] start hiring people it's like oh this
[82:10] person is not working enough or
[82:11] something. There's always love to see
[82:13] you talk about the struggles because uh
[82:15] most of your videos you never talked
[82:17] about the struggles like you mentioned
[82:19] the base thing uh like that you work in
[82:22] and all that but like you don't dive too
[82:25] deep into like what will you get out of
[82:27] that the the paycheck to paycheck
[82:33] um emails cold emails is how I got it
[82:36] there I literally went from like a very
[82:39] base salary minimum
[82:40] to having an that was making the same
[82:42] amount of money but from my computer so
[82:44] I could leave anywhere and I moved to
[82:46] Bali and it's because of cold emails. If
[82:48] you build an audience it takes a lot of
[82:49] time. It will take you a year to get to
[82:51] a point where you get something
[82:52] significant. Yeah. If you start cold
[82:54] emails ads is tricky but cold emails at
[82:57] least you can get to someone you sell to
[82:59] B2B and you can get someone who pays a
[83:01] lot. Yeah. Start from B2B because if
[83:05] you're really paycheck to paycheck and
[83:06] you need money go for B2B code emails.
[83:08] It's boring, but you have the grief
[83:09] inside of you because you want to get
[83:10] out of the paycheck to paycheck life.
[83:12] Yeah. Yeah. And then once you're out of
[83:13] there, right, guys, we're going to do
[83:21] I we we chat after I need to just wrap
[83:23] the meet up. Okay. Well, cool.
[83:28] Same.
[83:30] Okay. Um All right, everyone. I think uh
[83:35] well you guys are you guys okay this is
[83:38] literally like a startup center and uh
[83:40] everybody's having fun should we even
[83:41] end up this meetup
[83:45] anyway I think my okay my job is
[83:48] accomplished now this is what I wanted
[83:50] like people hanging out and there we go
[83:54] um is there
[83:58] anyone what is the strategy to make
[84:00] people come here
[84:07] It's working. Hey everyone,

[84:30] Okay. Uh
[84:33] Oh, wow.
[84:35] Wow. Okay. Maybe Oh, just maybe one
[84:38] second and I'm just going to like little
[84:41] closure and then we can make a photo all
[84:42] together here. Okay. Okay. Uh Okay. At
[84:46] the back, please come on

[84:53] projector? Yeah. Where is my
[84:57] thing? Do you get Do you has the
[85:03] Where did I put it?

[85:12] you. Okay. Uh, where are
[85:15] we? I made you all the way to show you
[85:18] [Laughter]
[85:21] this. Okay. Um, okay. So, I'm going to
[85:25] be staying around. We have the venue
[85:26] until 5:00 p.m. so we can hang out, um,
[85:30] talk, whatever. Um, I just wanted I know
[85:32] lots of you by raising their hands, you
[85:34] said that you were coming here with a
[85:35] plane, a train or something. I'm super
[85:37] grateful for all of you guys who came
[85:40] from far and also came from Mumbai. Uh,
[85:42] it's amazing that you're here. I hope
[85:44] you'll leave this meetup with a
[85:46] co-ounder, a friend, an idea, some
[85:47] motivation. Someone here mentioned that
[85:49] they'll ship an app on the 14th of May.
[85:52] So we're Yep. 12th of May. So yeah, make
[85:55] those deadlines like like you know

[85:59] and um and a big thanks for coming.
[86:07] Uh okay, before we scatter everywhere
[86:10] around, should we make a big photo?
[86:13] Okay. Where uh what do you think would
[86:16] be a nice uh place for a photo like
[86:18] this?
[86:21] Okay. Yeah, that's a good idea. better
[86:23] lighting. Um, how do we how do we turn
[86:26] off the projector? That's a good qu. Can
[86:27] Okay, so can we someone turn off the
[86:30] projector?
[86:32] Thanks. And I
[86:35] think Okay, should we get this angle
[86:38] like we all gather here?
[86:40] Okay, let's go.
[86:43] Uh, I think facing the projector looking
[86:45] that way like this.
[86:48] Okay,
[86:50] there's way more people now than there
[86:52] were at the beginning. Wow.
[87:08] Ah. Uh I think as as there are so many
[87:10] people so the first rule would be sit
[87:13] down completely and then like gradually
[87:16] like a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe.
[87:19] Yeah. Oh, no. Good. I think just lower.
[87:24] Maybe more front. Can you guys come to
[87:28] the front to see the face for everyone?
[87:31] Yeah. I think there's so many.
[87:36] Yeah. Okay. Maybe maybe a little bit
[87:39] low. Low.
[87:40] Yeah. Mark, do you want to be in the
[87:43] center? Yeah. Yeah.
[87:47] Everyone wants to see your ka.
[87:55] Oh, the the people from the back you can
[87:57] come front too. Yeah, there are more
[88:00] space. So, please come front so that we
[88:03] can see everyone.
[88:08] Yeah. And maybe middle middle row a
[88:11] little bit like a bend the knee for
[88:13] people for the back. Okay. Okay. Sounds
[88:17] looks better.
