[00:00] awesome uh thank you mike
[00:02] uh
[00:04] can i get permission to share my screen
[00:06] i do not have the permission right now
[00:08] but uh before while we wait i'll get a
[00:10] little i'll talk a little about myself
[00:11] mike obviously sort of highlighted what
[00:13] are oh great now i can do it uh
[00:17] mike highlighted what our group is about
[00:19] um
[00:25] i'm so sorry
[00:26] i might sort of highlight about what our
[00:27] group is about um
[00:29] but yeah i'm a data scientist at the nfl
[00:31] league office i've been working there
[00:32] since february uh today i'm going to be
[00:34] talking about
[00:35] using betting line data to estimate the
[00:37] magnitude of travel rest and home
[00:40] advantages in nfl
[00:43] today
[00:44] um my twitter is at beta with bliss if
[00:47] you if you want to tweet a question or
[00:50] something about the talk or just send me
[00:52] a funny meme uh feel free to do so i
[00:54] appreciate it all
[00:56] um
[00:56] yeah first i'd like to say i'm thankful
[00:58] for being here i'm really excited to be
[01:01] here i'd like to thank um everybody on
[01:03] the panel everybody who organized i want
[01:05] to thank mike uh what because he helped
[01:07] me a lot with this presentation as well
[01:09] as getting me involved
[01:10] uh so
[01:11] with that i'll i'll just jump right into
[01:13] it
[01:15] the goal of um the research that i'm
[01:17] presenting today we were attempting to
[01:19] figure out what is the magnitude of home
[01:21] field advantage what is the magnitude of
[01:23] travel advantage what's the magnitude of
[01:24] rest advantage how does that affect
[01:27] actual outcomes of games how how does
[01:30] playing on a monday night compared to
[01:32] another team playing on a sunday night
[01:33] does that actually how does that affect
[01:34] the outcome how does plane at home
[01:35] affect the outcome
[01:37] um
[01:38] all of this is incredibly important to
[01:40] us um as we put together a schedule we
[01:43] have a scheduling group and
[01:45] um it's a very difficult process and
[01:48] although
[01:49] we we like to have we're ultimately an
[01:52] entertainment industry we also want to
[01:54] make sure we're fair to the teams
[01:56] if we wanted to optimize for
[01:57] entertainment we just have cowboys and
[02:00] kansas city chiefs playing every monday
[02:01] thursday and sunday but we do have to
[02:04] have some
[02:05] evenness of the schedule it'd be unfair
[02:07] if they if if playing on these days is
[02:10] um a disadvantage and that these teams
[02:12] are constantly
[02:14] being given this disadvantage so we have
[02:15] to make sure that
[02:17] rest advantages are distributed equally
[02:19] travel home advantages teams have to
[02:21] play in london sometimes you have to
[02:22] make sure that's all even um this also
[02:25] all this also applies to the postseason
[02:27] format
[02:28] as i'm sure many of you know in in 2020
[02:32] we have a different postseason format
[02:33] than we normally do we now have seven
[02:36] teams in the playoffs
[02:38] and
[02:40] one less team has a buy before two teams
[02:42] would have a buy per conference
[02:44] now only one team has a viper conference
[02:46] and and that's significant and we have
[02:48] to think about okay now there's less a
[02:51] team doesn't have a pretty big rest
[02:52] advantage you have a full week off
[02:54] that's pretty big a team doesn't have
[02:55] that what what does that
[02:57] do
[02:58] to um to the postseason
[03:00] and finally this all can tie into rules
[03:02] proposals
[03:03] there's a lot of rule proposals that we
[03:05] as the data team in the league office we
[03:08] look at
[03:09] and some of them tie into or if you're
[03:11] the home team you get x you're the
[03:13] visiting team you get x we got to make
[03:15] sure that we we know what advantages
[03:18] already exist uh when we're applying
[03:20] these rules
[03:22] so uh the process that that we kind of
[03:25] go through uh i use sports betting data
[03:28] um and i'm gonna explain why sports
[03:29] spending data is is significant in what
[03:32] we use in an aesthetic and a give
[03:34] sampling model and what we attempt to do
[03:36] is we try to parse these magnitudes
[03:39] out of the out of the betting lines try
[03:40] to parse them out of the betting line
[03:42] probabilities
[03:43] um
[03:44] to to figure out what exactly they are
[03:46] um
[03:47] so we we know that
[03:49] a betting line will be based on how good
[03:51] the teams are um and then these several
[03:53] other advantages we have to figure out
[03:55] okay what part of the betting line goes
[03:57] to
[03:58] how good these teams are what part of
[04:00] the betting line goes to this advantage
[04:01] what part of the betting line goes to
[04:02] this advantage um and and one other
[04:05] thing i would like to say a lot of this
[04:06] work is uh built on um
[04:09] a paper randomness and sport uh by
[04:12] matthews bomber and mike lopez
[04:15] so i would highly recommend you check
[04:16] that out especially if you're interested
[04:18] in what i talked about today um so so
[04:20] yeah so i'll
[04:22] i'll first explain why are we using
[04:24] betting line data because
[04:26] it's it might seem a little bit random
[04:28] like why why betting line data well the
[04:30] reason we like betting line data is it's
[04:33] incredibly accurate
[04:34] so
[04:35] uh what we have here is we have the the
[04:37] y-axis
[04:39] is the observed probability the observed
[04:41] wind probability the x-axis is the
[04:43] betting line implied probability
[04:45] um each dot represents a cluster of
[04:47] games so we take a cluster of games
[04:50] where the
[04:51] betting line probability
[04:53] for example
[04:54] is around like 50
[04:57] or maybe 45 percent
[04:59] we take this cluster
[05:00] and we compare
[05:02] that probability
[05:04] to the actual when percentage of games
[05:07] that are sort of within that cluster
[05:10] and we see
[05:11] how does that match up so anything on
[05:13] the line means it's a perfect um it's a
[05:16] perfect measurement
[05:18] and as you can see outside of
[05:20] maybe some a few dots on the ends
[05:22] a lot of these dots are right uh on the
[05:25] line that tells us that these betting
[05:27] lines are are pretty accurate um they're
[05:30] telling us
[05:31] that when they say it's about a 20
[05:33] chance of winning it typically means
[05:35] it's 20 of the teams actually win um and
[05:38] yeah and i guess another thing i'd like
[05:39] to note here is the the bigger the dot
[05:42] uh the more the bigger the cluster of
[05:43] games so although we have a few dots um
[05:46] on the on the two ends that
[05:48] um are off the line
[05:50] they're smaller i think that the dot um
[05:53] closest to zero percent i think is
[05:54] literally six games and they just none
[05:56] of them happen to be victories and this
[05:59] one uh the one
[06:00] in the upper right hand corner might be
[06:02] 30 games so
[06:04] we really feel good about this bedding
[06:06] line data and we really feel good if
[06:08] we're gonna we're extracting we're
[06:09] trying to estimate information from it
[06:11] we feel like this is a very good source
[06:13] to estimate information
[06:16] all right so back to um what we're
[06:19] really interested in here we want to
[06:21] figure out
[06:22] how do these betting markets perceive
[06:24] home advantage rest advantage and travel
[06:27] advantage um
[06:29] we want to see are
[06:30] do the betting markets perceive them the
[06:32] same they do now that they did 10 years
[06:34] ago
[06:35] is it totally
[06:37] new is it totally um does it change per
[06:40] week for example maybe a buy in week
[06:42] three doesn't matter as much to buy in
[06:44] week 13
[06:46] maybe if you travel later in the season
[06:48] maybe that also might have an effect
[06:50] we're interested but it is this
[06:52] like when when our when are buys most
[06:54] significant when
[06:56] it are they most significant at
[06:57] different times that there's a lot of
[06:59] different things to think about and
[07:01] finally we're going to look at and say
[07:03] oh are some teams benefiting or not
[07:06] benefiting from these advantages is is
[07:08] it significant
[07:10] what's going on there
[07:12] so um
[07:14] i'm going to go through these uh i i
[07:16] don't have any slides on home advantage
[07:18] i i think that is pretty
[07:21] um
[07:22] intuitive
[07:23] the home advantage simply is defined as
[07:25] if you're playing at home you have home
[07:27] advantage um if if for example the
[07:30] jaguars like to play in london a lot the
[07:32] jaguars playing in london they do not
[07:33] have home advantage that's a neutral
[07:34] site bill's playing toronto that's
[07:36] neutral site but if you are playing on
[07:37] your own home field that's home
[07:39] advantage um and that's
[07:41] that's our definition so
[07:42] i'm not going to get too deep into that
[07:44] but i will get into travel and rest
[07:46] advantage it although we know that
[07:49] travel and rest advantages exist or we
[07:51] think they might exist how would you
[07:53] actually define a team with a travel
[07:55] advantage um
[07:57] so we thought about different ways to
[07:59] think about that is it an issue of time
[08:02] zones
[08:02] maybe if teams are playing on different
[08:05] time zones um
[08:07] like like you're you're not one team is
[08:08] used to playing at one o'clock one team
[08:10] feels like they're playing at 12 o'clock
[08:12] is that a an advantage um we found it
[08:15] was insignificant compared to
[08:18] other variables um another thing
[08:20] that it's talked about a lot is what if
[08:22] a pacific
[08:23] time team like a west coast team like
[08:27] raiders 49ers rams chargers they have to
[08:29] go to the east coast and they're playing
[08:31] at that 1pm sunday window is that a dis
[08:34] a big disadvantage are they
[08:36] um unable to
[08:39] they feel like they're playing at 10 a.m
[08:40] and the team they're playing feels like
[08:41] playing at 1pm is that a big advantage
[08:43] and again um it was insignificant when
[08:46] when we looked at some other variables
[08:49] we also thought oh maybe the reverse
[08:50] maybe if you're an east coast team and
[08:52] you're going to the west coast you're
[08:53] playing at night maybe maybe that's a
[08:55] big disadvantage
[08:56] um
[08:57] again it wasn't that big
[09:00] part of the issue with this in
[09:02] particular was there was a very small
[09:03] sample size most of our teams are on the
[09:05] east coast
[09:06] so
[09:07] it's not as likely and there's only like
[09:10] three there's only three prime time
[09:12] windows a week typically so you're not
[09:15] and west coast teams tend to play other
[09:16] west coast teams because of the way the
[09:17] divisions are structured so it doesn't
[09:19] happen as often but uh that was
[09:23] insignificant the one thing that really
[09:25] stood out is significant is travel
[09:26] distance just pure miles
[09:29] how far you went from one side of the
[09:31] country to another
[09:36] so
[09:38] right here we have a chart uh we're talk
[09:40] we're thinking about the distance
[09:41] defined by travel miles x-axis and
[09:44] y-axis are the same that's the real
[09:46] distance in miles um each dot represents
[09:49] a number of games at that given travel
[09:51] distance bigger the dot more games
[09:54] so
[09:55] i highlight four uh games here um i
[09:58] chose to choose the new york giants we
[10:00] are at yukon uh that's i guess the
[10:03] closest team against the jets are tai
[10:06] and i imagine a lot of our west coast
[10:08] friends might still be asleep because
[10:10] it's early so i decided to choose new
[10:11] york giants just everyone knows that uh
[10:14] so i highlighted four games here so that
[10:16] giants playing new york
[10:18] the giants playing philadelphia the
[10:19] giants playing la and the giants playing
[10:21] san francisco
[10:23] my uh my intuitive thought was okay
[10:26] if the giants are playing the jets
[10:28] they're literally not leaving they're
[10:30] staying in their own home bed they're
[10:31] they're playing at their own stadium
[10:33] just maybe they're playing in a visitor
[10:34] locker maybe they're not
[10:36] that the difference between that and
[10:38] actually having to take a hour drive
[10:40] hour and a half drive to philadelphia
[10:41] that's pretty huge in my opinion like
[10:43] you're you're going from
[10:45] nothing to something
[10:47] uh but when you think about la ver san
[10:49] francisco i would think that's probably
[10:51] about the same
[10:52] i grew up in california and i live in
[10:54] new york now i didn't even know that
[10:57] san francisco was a further further away
[10:59] than la i thought la was further so i
[11:01] didn't even know that there was a
[11:02] difference
[11:03] uh i
[11:05] to me i think they're both pretty long
[11:06] flights i don't know if it really
[11:07] matters
[11:09] so i i created this slide sort of just
[11:11] highlight what i'm talking about i mean
[11:13] the difference between philadelphia and
[11:14] new york is 85 miles whereas san
[11:17] francisco and l.a
[11:18] from new york it's 99 miles
[11:21] um
[11:22] so right if we just use straight travel
[11:25] distance like that we're suggesting that
[11:27] the difference between new york and
[11:28] philadelphia
[11:30] um compared to new york and new york
[11:32] that is a smaller difference than new
[11:34] york going to one of two cities in
[11:36] california which are a five hour flight
[11:38] away
[11:39] we knew that didn't really make sense so
[11:41] what we what we did was we thought okay
[11:44] we're going to allow our model i mean in
[11:46] the modeling stage i'm going to touch on
[11:48] this a little bit more um we're going to
[11:51] allow our model to
[11:52] transform the distance to
[11:56] make it so
[11:57] at the tail end it really doesn't matter
[12:00] whether you're another 100 miles away
[12:02] but at the very start it's a huge
[12:04] difference each mile really counts
[12:07] um
[12:08] sort of the thought we wanted and for
[12:10] those who love calculus i don't know how
[12:11] many are out there maybe there are a
[12:13] decent amount at a sports analytics
[12:14] conference but for those who love
[12:16] calculus we wanted to have a negative
[12:17] derivative we wanted
[12:19] it to the the curve to slow down to to
[12:22] to flatten out as uh miles increased
[12:26] uh so
[12:28] that we let the model sort of find what
[12:30] was best we tried um a few functions we
[12:32] tried exponential we
[12:34] panch we tried some trigonometric
[12:36] functions the thing that really worked
[12:39] the best we found was an nth root
[12:41] function i'm going to let the model
[12:43] determine n
[12:44] um and the
[12:46] uh the answer is about one-fifth but but
[12:49] anyway the value here and you can you
[12:51] can see in the graph i mean new york
[12:53] versus new york
[12:54] is um right down there and then a big
[12:57] jump to philadelphia
[12:59] and then la and san francisco um right
[13:01] next to each other
[13:03] it's it works out a lot better um one
[13:06] now the the advantage is a lot bigger
[13:08] between philadelphia
[13:10] um the travel ban for philadelphia
[13:12] compared to the new york jets a lot
[13:14] bigger than the 49ers compared to the
[13:16] rams which again i'm still surprised
[13:18] that there was that that the 49ers are
[13:20] actually san francisco's further away
[13:21] from la
[13:23] so we went ahead and made that fix and
[13:25] um that's how we define travel distance
[13:27] in our data um obviously we have the
[13:29] schedule so we know where teams are
[13:32] playing and we
[13:34] this is observed data this is data that
[13:36] we are aware of
[13:38] um so now that we have a way to sort of
[13:41] quantify our observed travel data now we
[13:44] have to think about rest
[13:48] so uh right here we have a histogram
[13:50] the left-hand side of the histogram will
[13:53] have
[13:54] uh situations where the away team has
[13:56] more days of rest in the home team the
[13:58] right side will be situations in which
[14:01] the home team has more days of rest than
[14:04] the away team and right at zero it's
[14:06] even rest um and
[14:08] these uh differences can occur because
[14:11] of a monday night football game or
[14:13] thursday night football game or
[14:15] a bye week something like that has
[14:17] happened where they're not playing on
[14:18] the same day but then they meet on the
[14:20] same day
[14:21] so um two-thirds of games we're going to
[14:24] call even rest they they have the exact
[14:26] same number of days of rest
[14:29] it doesn't make a difference whether
[14:31] they they both have the same the same
[14:33] sort of rest advantage
[14:35] no no team had more rest than another
[14:38] we're gonna define
[14:39] one to four days as short rest this is
[14:42] you had
[14:44] this is typically a monday night a
[14:45] thursday night maybe even a saturday
[14:47] game
[14:48] um
[14:49] something happened and one team has four
[14:52] days one team has two i mean it's
[14:54] typically one or three i think which
[14:56] correspond to thursday and monday night
[14:58] football
[15:00] um and
[15:01] that that that's what we define as a
[15:03] short rest advantage
[15:04] finally we have the buy advantage and
[15:06] that's a team had an entire week off and
[15:09] you're meeting i mean one team played 14
[15:10] days ago one team played seven days ago
[15:12] or this could be 13 or 15 depending on
[15:15] how um
[15:17] the prime time windows line up but
[15:20] that's what we call buy advantage uh
[15:22] and
[15:23] obviously this is again something we
[15:25] haven't we have a schedule we know what
[15:27] dates teams played so this is observed
[15:28] we know what advantages
[15:31] teams had and now we just have to
[15:32] measure the significance
[15:34] one last note about this slide that i'm
[15:36] going to mention
[15:38] when two teams are coming off buys but
[15:40] one team maybe played on a monday so one
[15:43] team played like 13 days ago one team
[15:45] played 14 days ago we just put that in
[15:46] the even rest category simply because
[15:50] i don't think that
[15:52] after a certain point if you have 13
[15:54] days versus 14 days that one day
[15:56] probably doesn't matter a lot of the
[15:57] players will have a few days off during
[15:59] that week anyway so
[16:01] that is just an even list
[16:03] all right so now that we've defined what
[16:06] our observed data how we're quantifying
[16:08] our observed data now we've got to get
[16:10] into some math
[16:11] so and yeah this is a lot of math i
[16:13] thank everybody for waking up early on a
[16:15] saturday and choosing to look at this
[16:17] much math um
[16:18] but i'll try to get through it and we'll
[16:21] get um and hopefully you'll understand
[16:23] um so the first what i have here is is
[16:26] an equation a bunch of definitions uh
[16:28] i'm gonna
[16:29] do something i'm gonna highlight what is
[16:31] observed and what is estimated what we
[16:34] we already know from the schedule and
[16:36] what we're trying to figure out
[16:39] so the red is estimated the redis are
[16:41] our quantities we're going to learn from
[16:44] our model the black is stuff that we
[16:46] already know because we have the
[16:46] schedule or or the vetting line data for
[16:49] our dependent variable
[16:51] um and uh so i'm going to go through and
[16:53] explain each of these set of terms one
[16:56] by one i don't want to get too into the
[16:57] weeds of this i feel
[16:59] the the results will probably be a
[17:01] little bit interesting but i also want
[17:02] to make sure everybody understands how
[17:05] we got
[17:08] so the first term i'm going to highlight
[17:09] here this is our dependent variable this
[17:11] is on the left hand side of the equation
[17:12] this is our y this is our
[17:16] the variable that um were were
[17:19] using to sort of drive the model
[17:22] so what we have here is the betting line
[17:25] implied probability that team i will be
[17:28] team j during season s and week k
[17:31] so for example
[17:33] um
[17:33] the the let's say the raiders played the
[17:35] chiefs week five last year um it would
[17:38] be the
[17:40] for that probability would be the
[17:41] probability in season equals 2019
[17:45] week equals five that team i the chiefs
[17:48] will be team j the raiders
[17:50] we we
[17:52] notice that it's not um per season
[17:55] each week we have a different betting
[17:57] line probability and that's uh true
[18:00] throughout and that's an important
[18:01] distinction that we're paying attention
[18:03] to
[18:04] um
[18:05] that's because for a lot of reasons um i
[18:08] mean everybody
[18:10] there are teams that start out hot and
[18:12] maybe have some injuries and don't
[18:13] finish as well and there are teams that
[18:15] sort of get a second win late in the
[18:17] season
[18:18] um
[18:19] yeah so we we we got to make sure that
[18:21] we're taking into account that teams
[18:23] change week to week uh maybe there's a
[18:25] quarterback change maybe
[18:27] injuries is a big one too maybe there's
[18:28] a coach gets fired there's a lot of
[18:30] things that could happen week to week so
[18:32] we got to make sure that we have
[18:34] um a different probability each week
[18:36] the next two terms um these are the i'm
[18:38] going to highlight the other theta for
[18:40] you for those of you who like greek
[18:42] symbols the theta terms
[18:44] uh that is the team strength
[18:47] of of um team i and team j during season
[18:50] s and week k and again
[18:52] team strengths change all the time
[18:55] for example our model fell when patrick
[18:58] mahomes was injured last year the team's
[19:00] strength was lower than when he was
[19:02] healthy i mean and that's probably true
[19:04] with a lot of teams quarterbacks but
[19:06] that's
[19:06] the most extreme example i can think of
[19:09] um so we have the team strength of team
[19:12] i during season s and week k um so
[19:15] it could be the chiefs 2019 week five
[19:18] and then the team strength of team
[19:20] j during season s and weekend the
[19:22] raiders 2019 week five um and we're
[19:26] we're subtracting them we're figuring
[19:27] out what is the difference between the
[19:28] two team strengths they could be equal
[19:31] one could be better than the other
[19:32] um this will sort of um account for the
[19:36] team strength part of the model again as
[19:38] i sort of said from the beginning we're
[19:39] not necessarily interested in this this
[19:41] is just something we know
[19:42] betting lines take into account and we
[19:45] have to
[19:46] make sure that we're we're taking them
[19:47] into account in order to parse out the
[19:49] information we actually are interested
[19:51] in
[19:52] okay
[19:54] so the next term we have here is our
[19:56] home advantage term
[19:58] we have both an intercept
[20:00] which is
[20:01] alpha alpha h
[20:04] and a trend term which is beta h
[20:07] um
[20:08] alpha will be constant and beta will be
[20:11] a trend actually let me start by
[20:13] explaining this last term a little bit
[20:15] this is also this is probably the most
[20:17] important part this is the home
[20:18] advantage this is observed so
[20:21] this valve this will be equal to one
[20:24] if the team is actually playing at home
[20:26] and zero if it's a neutral site
[20:28] so this alpha term that we're going to
[20:30] be estimating
[20:31] um
[20:32] will provide a value for a constant home
[20:37] advantage that's been true 2006 to 2019
[20:40] that's that's our data set um that'll be
[20:42] true the entire time this beta term uh
[20:45] because we found that home advantage
[20:46] actually is changing each season will
[20:48] will account for how it's how it's
[20:50] changing per season so if s is equal to
[20:53] 2006 this will be zero if s is equal to
[20:55] 2019 it'll it'll be pushed all the way
[20:58] to
[20:59] um it'll be adjusted based on the fact
[21:00] that it's 2019.
[21:02] um
[21:03] this
[21:04] that that that's what we were able to
[21:06] find from um for home advantage
[21:10] the next is travel and again this alpha
[21:13] term is really what we're interested in
[21:14] alpha t
[21:16] that is multiplied by
[21:18] as i described in the previous slide are
[21:20] the observed travel uh distance
[21:23] uh
[21:24] the travel distance will be the distance
[21:27] from from the visiting t from team j to
[21:30] the to the game site minus
[21:33] team i to the game site so let's say if
[21:35] team i is playing at home like actual
[21:37] home um that'll be zero so it'll be just
[21:41] the miles team j is trapping let's say
[21:43] if they're media in london that number
[21:45] could even be negative if um team i
[21:48] might be designated as the home team
[21:51] but team i uh well that could be
[21:53] negative if team i actually like hey
[21:56] remember the raiders hosted the dolphins
[21:58] hosted the dolphins in london that was
[22:00] technically a home team for the raiders
[22:02] that doesn't actually mean that the
[22:03] raiders had
[22:05] home advantage and then nor do they have
[22:07] travel advantage and then this exponent
[22:09] here that's how we got the one-fifth
[22:12] that is an estimate of what the
[22:14] transformation should be
[22:16] um again we're not necessarily
[22:18] interested in that but we know we need
[22:19] to have it um to to figure it out that
[22:22] that gamma right there in the exponent
[22:24] that's just something we need to know
[22:26] and finally uh i'm almost done with the
[22:29] math i promise
[22:30] we have
[22:31] our rest terms so
[22:34] this rest term alpha
[22:36] short rest
[22:37] that's what we're interested in this is
[22:39] the observed short rest so
[22:41] if
[22:42] if team i has short rest
[22:45] advantage it'll be equal to one if it's
[22:47] even rest it'll be equal to zero so this
[22:49] entire term will just disappear
[22:51] if
[22:52] tmi has a as a short rest disadvantage
[22:56] then this will be negative one so this
[22:58] will work in team j's fate
[23:00] um alpha this term works the exact same
[23:04] way except for with buy rest
[23:06] so that um
[23:08] these terms just account for the for the
[23:10] rest as i described
[23:12] i i hope that you were you guys were
[23:14] able to follow that uh
[23:16] i um could answer i could get more deep
[23:18] into the math if people wish um during
[23:21] the question session but this is all i
[23:23] have for math so for those of you who
[23:25] fell asleep please wake back up and
[23:27] we'll start to get to the results
[23:30] so
[23:31] although we aren't interested
[23:33] necessarily in team strength one way we
[23:36] can validate our model make sure this
[23:38] model makes sense is see
[23:40] what teams
[23:43] see what teams are
[23:46] what teams are doing what teams are the
[23:49] best in terms of team strength
[23:52] the
[23:54] the like throughout our data set so the
[23:57] best team for a given season week from
[24:00] 2006 to 2019
[24:02] are the new england patriots in 2007
[24:04] they were the
[24:06] 16-0 team
[24:08] um during the regular season so it's no
[24:10] surprise that their scene has the best
[24:12] team from 2006 to 2019 the entirety of
[24:14] our data set the worst team um was the
[24:17] dolphins last year and as some of you
[24:20] guys might remember the dolphins started
[24:22] out 0-8 or 0-9 um they were they lost a
[24:26] bunch of games by
[24:28] double digits i remember the first game
[24:30] i think they lost 49 to 10 to the
[24:31] baltimore ravens they just got
[24:33] absolutely
[24:34] um
[24:35] killed
[24:36] uh to i don't know a better way to say
[24:38] it but um another team also that was
[24:41] sort of in the mix for being the worst
[24:42] team were the um
[24:44] the uh jacksonville jaguars of 2013
[24:48] during week eight which again maybe
[24:49] isn't a team that's memorable but they
[24:51] lost every game by
[24:53] an average of 21 points going into week
[24:55] 8. um and yeah and that's another thing
[24:57] that i want to sort of note about the
[24:59] dolphins too they started out very
[25:02] poorly they actually finished the season
[25:03] with five wins they weren't an awful a
[25:05] historically bad team but based on how
[25:07] they played at the beginning of the
[25:08] season um
[25:10] this was able to pick up okay this was a
[25:12] bad team
[25:13] from the from the get-go
[25:18] now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
[25:20] plot
[25:22] each of the team strengths by week and
[25:24] this is the 2019 season i know we're in
[25:26] the 2020 season so maybe we don't
[25:29] remember all the the story lines and how
[25:32] teams went um it was all about a year
[25:34] ago uh when when when during the season
[25:37] but i'm just going to sort of recap this
[25:39] is just these are
[25:41] plots of um the four afc east teams
[25:45] as a lot of us remember the patriots
[25:47] started out really well
[25:49] but then sort of towards the end of the
[25:50] season they tailed off
[25:52] the dolphins as i was just sort of
[25:54] saying in the previous slide they
[25:55] started off very poorly
[25:57] but they
[25:58] ended the season
[26:00] not on a bad note um
[26:02] the jets they also had a sort of a dip
[26:05] in the middle of the season then they
[26:06] ended the season seven and nine so the
[26:08] model is able to pick up on team
[26:10] improvement
[26:12] the team doesn't have to be constant
[26:14] throughout
[26:16] these are all the divisions um 2019
[26:21] by week
[26:23] and again maybe we don't remember the
[26:25] story lines but i'll just highlight a
[26:27] few things that were interesting
[26:29] um as i noted the the chiefs um started
[26:32] out really strong patrick mahomes gets
[26:34] injured and then they have a few dots
[26:36] where their their team strength sort of
[26:38] dips
[26:39] um yeah maybe maybe to make this i
[26:42] should have made it more clear in the
[26:42] last slide the the y-axis here are a
[26:45] point spread added sort of point
[26:47] differential expected point differential
[26:49] against an average team so the higher
[26:51] you are the better the lower you are the
[26:52] worse and
[26:54] the x axis is weak uh but as the chief
[26:57] started out as a very strong team in
[26:58] terms of their team strength uh they
[27:02] patrick mahomes unfortunately gets
[27:03] injured um they go down he comes back
[27:06] and then they're a top team again
[27:08] another uh team i'd like to highlight
[27:09] are the detroit lions in the this
[27:12] gray and dark blue in the nfc north they
[27:15] were a pretty good team
[27:17] then
[27:18] uh staffer gets injured i think they
[27:21] were four and four or five and four
[27:23] something like that then they go
[27:25] completely downhill um simply because
[27:28] they lost their quarterback
[27:30] uh and another division i like to
[27:32] highlight is the nfc east
[27:34] we see two teams philadelphia and dallas
[27:38] at the top two teams new york and
[27:40] washington in the bottom
[27:42] uh sort of what we'd expect and i guess
[27:43] one more the nfc west we have three
[27:45] teams that are are very good the
[27:47] cardinals weren't as good last year
[27:50] so
[27:51] uh it's interesting we can we can talk
[27:53] about a bunch of these divisions and it
[27:55] you can you can sort of see how teams
[27:57] change throughout the season
[27:59] and certain things might have affected
[28:01] their their perceived team strength from
[28:04] from the betting market
[28:07] all right now let's talk about the
[28:08] results that we as the league were
[28:09] actually interested in
[28:12] what are what what does the model
[28:13] actually think about in terms of rest in
[28:16] terms of home advantage in terms of
[28:19] travel binge so
[28:21] short rest is worth about 0.36 points
[28:23] that's that's the estimate of the gibbs
[28:24] sample lean model
[28:28] fire rest about point six seven uh those
[28:30] both seem pretty reasonable to me so
[28:33] they're both about half a point where
[28:35] but by rest is a little bit more
[28:37] um
[28:38] and and again point spread can kind of
[28:40] be thought of as just expected margin of
[28:41] victory um so just these sort of help by
[28:45] about half a point they sort of help in
[28:47] a maybe a toss-up game that's that's
[28:49] sort of what this is this is implying
[28:51] um home advantage is about
[28:53] 2.15 points
[28:56] um the
[28:58] the
[29:01] people probably are a little bit
[29:02] confused by that because typically you
[29:04] think of home advantage in the nfl it's
[29:06] two and a half to three points
[29:08] however if we add in the travel
[29:10] advantage and most of the case there
[29:12] most of the time they're separated out
[29:13] on average an nfl team travels about 500
[29:15] miles so if you add about 0.69 that's
[29:18] the average travel
[29:20] you get right in the 2.7 2.8 range which
[29:23] is typically what uh most of us would
[29:26] expect for home advantage
[29:29] um but but this is really interesting in
[29:31] the sense that
[29:32] uh it like you when
[29:35] base home advantage with no
[29:38] like new york planet new york we think
[29:39] it we estimated more closer to two
[29:42] points than um
[29:45] and maybe three points um as as uh may
[29:48] be the case when you're actually
[29:50] traveling um outside of your stadium
[29:58] so these are one advantage to give
[30:00] sampling models the sampling model so we
[30:02] get various estimates we can get a
[30:04] distribution of what our
[30:07] answers are
[30:09] the we we can look at the magnitudes
[30:11] here uh as we sort of saw in the
[30:13] previous slide
[30:15] short rest and by rest are certainly
[30:17] less than the the other magnitudes that
[30:19] we're seeing here
[30:21] one thing that i think is interesting is
[30:23] we notice that the distribution the
[30:25] estimate for
[30:26] home advantage with zero miles is really
[30:28] flat
[30:29] that is partially because there aren't
[30:31] that many games with zero miles it's
[30:33] only new york at new york we'll start to
[30:36] get some now that la and la the two la
[30:38] teams share a stadium but for the most
[30:40] part that's the only time we really see
[30:42] those type of games
[30:45] and the home advantage
[30:47] with 500 miles that's the skinniest
[30:49] simply because that's where we see the
[30:50] most amount of
[30:53] games about about 500 miles and 2000
[30:55] miles a little bit is in between the two
[30:58] because we see that more often than zero
[31:00] miles but it's still not necessarily a
[31:02] common occurrence
[31:09] so we we now want to think okay we are
[31:13] these changing
[31:14] over time
[31:16] um
[31:17] and as i sort of highlight in the
[31:18] modeling stage uh we we found that
[31:21] shortened by rest actually aren't
[31:23] changing that much over time we we
[31:25] thought maybe by season they we didn't
[31:27] think we didn't have a reason to think
[31:28] by season they would change
[31:30] but by weeks we thought maybe a week for
[31:33] buy is way more important than a week 15
[31:34] buy
[31:36] from what we were able to estimate from
[31:38] the the betting markets we haven't
[31:40] really found that to be the case
[31:42] there are different um part of it is we
[31:46] have a smaller sample size that i mean
[31:48] there's only a team only gets one by
[31:50] per season maybe they're playing another
[31:52] team with a buy but
[31:54] typically
[31:55] we might only see about 30 or so buy
[31:57] rests per season
[31:59] which isn't that many um so maybe with
[32:02] more data we'll start to pick something
[32:03] up but we haven't found
[32:05] something that would suggest that
[32:06] there's a difference by week i mean we
[32:08] have enough data to pick up it in
[32:10] general just the issue is if we're
[32:11] dividing it by week then we're really
[32:14] limiting our our space maybe to like
[32:17] 10 or so not that many per per season
[32:20] not that many in the total data set uh
[32:23] so that's why we have that's part of the
[32:24] reason maybe we didn't find anything but
[32:26] so far we haven't seen it
[32:30] um the
[32:32] the the home advantage we found actually
[32:36] has been dropping um each season by
[32:38] about .07 points uh the 0.215 that we
[32:42] showed here that's the average actually
[32:43] across all seasons
[32:45] um in 2006 it was about half a point
[32:48] more in 2019 it's about half a point
[32:50] less so from 2006 to 2019 it's almost
[32:54] dropped a full point which is which is
[32:56] crazy it's a lot
[32:58] um and uh i'm going to get into maybe
[33:00] some reasons why in the next slide
[33:03] but i'll just also note that travel
[33:05] advantage we haven't really found has
[33:06] changed so it's not that teams are
[33:08] getting better particularly at travel
[33:10] it's something else relating to home
[33:12] advantage
[33:13] that uh or at least that's what we're
[33:16] the betting markets are perceiving it
[33:17] the estimate suggests that it's
[33:19] something else related home advantage
[33:21] outside of travel
[33:25] so i just wanted to highlight what um
[33:28] how home advantage is changing right
[33:30] here we have that we have travel to the
[33:32] average which is around 500
[33:34] miles
[33:35] um
[33:36] and as you can see in in 2006 it's about
[33:38] 3.5 um and this is if we use each season
[33:42] as a the individual home advantage
[33:44] season this line is a best fit uh
[33:47] linear trend line to it
[33:49] in 2006 it's about 3.5 from 2019 it was
[33:54] it was under 2.5
[33:56] and it's a very clear linear trend i
[33:58] don't think there's really a doubt about
[34:00] it when we look at it this way home
[34:02] advantage is decreasing
[34:04] and um we thought about a lot of things
[34:07] we thought maybe it had to do with teams
[34:08] are traveling better but we didn't see
[34:10] it in travel advantage uh maybe teams
[34:13] are um getting better
[34:16] breaks on the road
[34:18] um
[34:19] maybe crowd noise we weren't entirely
[34:21] sure uh but we investigated sort of some
[34:25] key statistics that we can measure um in
[34:28] general about the team
[34:30] uh and we looked at whether or not they
[34:33] have been changing for home and visiting
[34:36] teams and or they're staying the same
[34:39] so i mean this is about to show probably
[34:41] the most key statistic in determining
[34:43] the outcome of anabolic game point score
[34:46] uh if you score more points than your
[34:48] opponent you typically win you always
[34:51] win actually i misspoke there you always
[34:53] win so the
[34:55] we we we looked at points scored by
[34:57] season and we look at 2006
[35:00] and we compared to 2019 this gap is
[35:02] shrinking um both teams are maybe
[35:04] scoring a little bit more points
[35:06] but the
[35:08] the the visiting team the home team is
[35:10] kind of flattening out the whole
[35:11] visiting team is catching up
[35:13] so
[35:14] um
[35:16] yeah maybe to speak more to the graph
[35:18] and maybe jump right into it each dot
[35:20] here
[35:21] represents um a season and a week
[35:25] and each and the y-axis is is points per
[35:28] game so for example in 2006 week two the
[35:31] home team on average scored
[35:34] around 26 points per game and these
[35:37] these trend lines they're sort of best
[35:38] fit lines they're average lines they're
[35:40] smooth airlines um just trying to pick
[35:43] up
[35:44] on average what does it kind of look
[35:46] like
[35:46] and
[35:47] um this this line that's sort of the
[35:49] average visitor score when we go across
[35:52] season and weeks it's meeting up with
[35:54] this line that's the average home score
[35:57] going across season in weeks
[35:59] and it it's about the same by the end
[36:03] um and it's interesting
[36:05] uh so
[36:07] that that's that's kind of a pretty
[36:10] easy way to think about it um another
[36:12] thing we thought about is penalties or
[36:14] maybe penalties changing
[36:16] and there are some penalties um
[36:19] such as offensive holding and this graph
[36:21] works exactly the same each dot is um
[36:26] each dot represents a season and week
[36:28] um and the average for that season and
[36:30] week in terms of fouls committed per
[36:31] game
[36:32] um and the what x axis is season week y
[36:35] axis is the fouls so
[36:38] we thought maybe penalties and some some
[36:40] sort of in-play penalties such as
[36:42] offensive holding defensive holding
[36:44] these are pretty common penalties
[36:46] these lines look pretty much the same
[36:48] the difference between them seem the
[36:49] same there isn't really a change like oh
[36:51] now
[36:52] visiting teams aren't committing
[36:54] offensive holding or something like that
[36:55] that's not really the case
[36:57] during these in-game penalties or
[36:59] in-play penalties but the pre-snap
[37:02] penalties we're definitely seeing
[37:03] visiting teams
[37:05] performing better doing doing better or
[37:08] maybe even just getting the home team to
[37:10] to commit them more often so
[37:13] when we look at neutral zone infraction
[37:14] we see this big gap between neutrals on
[37:17] infraction of the home team and the
[37:18] visiting team visiting teams are
[37:19] committed a lot more often but by 2019
[37:22] by the end of our data set it's about
[37:24] the same and same with delay of game and
[37:26] these are both these are penalties that
[37:28] maybe have to do with
[37:31] cadence and maybe have to do with um
[37:35] different
[37:37] uh
[37:38] like the quarterbacks trying to get
[37:41] uh the defenders to jump or
[37:43] uh crowd noise or something like that
[37:45] the the the
[37:46] visiting teams are catching up to the
[37:48] home teams in terms of that which is
[37:50] really interesting
[37:53] um
[37:54] so
[37:55] that's kind of what we we
[37:56] are attributing to now i mean there's
[37:59] probably a bunch of explanations um on
[38:01] why home advantage is shrinking um
[38:05] but uh
[38:06] these are the two ones that i really
[38:08] wanted to highlight uh that um
[38:11] they're clear and they make a whole lot
[38:13] of sense
[38:15] all right so
[38:17] this is my summary
[38:19] um
[38:20] home advantage is nearly down at full
[38:22] point since 2006 which is pretty
[38:24] incredible
[38:25] um
[38:26] fine short rest are worth about point
[38:28] six seven point three six points so
[38:29] they're not nothing so if a team wants
[38:32] to complain
[38:33] that maybe they're um that they
[38:36] had they had to play prime time windows
[38:39] um
[38:40] we we can have that discussion simply
[38:42] because now we know okay this is how
[38:44] much they're worth this is maybe how it
[38:46] had like the effect in general might
[38:48] have had on on your team across
[38:51] schedules
[38:52] uh you can actually sort of discuss that
[38:54] with numbers rather than
[38:56] sort of arguing oh this is this is
[38:59] really important this is not really
[39:00] important we actually know a numeric way
[39:02] to measure how important it's been
[39:05] and finally
[39:06] uh travel distance
[39:08] is um a lot more significant than time
[39:11] zone
[39:12] um so so that's kind of what we found uh
[39:15] the the next steps that we're definitely
[39:17] gonna be looking at i'm guessing i might
[39:19] get some questions about this maybe not
[39:20] but next steps um is we'll we obviously
[39:24] we know we're in a pretty unique season
[39:25] uh we're gonna have the opportunity to
[39:27] measure the value of fans how much do um
[39:30] crowds
[39:31] affect outcome of games
[39:33] unfortunately i i actually i tried i
[39:36] wanted to have something interesting for
[39:37] it for this presentation unfortunately
[39:39] it's really difficult as a lot of you
[39:42] statisticians and data scientists will
[39:43] know to make a inclusive point
[39:47] using only
[39:50] 63 games i guess they're 64 considering
[39:53] the thursday night game but only using
[39:54] 64 games 64
[39:57] data points
[39:58] um where we might have unusual um crowd
[40:02] conditions so right now we don't really
[40:05] have a strong or a good answer on why
[40:07] that might be the case but hopefully um
[40:09] in the 2020 offseason or maybe
[40:11] mid-season once we just have a few more
[40:14] games under our belt
[40:16] we can go ahead and make a
[40:18] conclusion
[40:20] and and find something interesting in
[40:21] regards to that so with that i want to
[40:24] say thank you thank thanks for for
[40:26] listening and i'm more than happy to
[40:28] answer any questions
[40:48] okay so there are no questions or am i
[40:50] supposed to read them somewhere
[40:54] um
[40:55] greg will be your chair let me
[40:58] uh
[41:00] well there is some question in the q and
[41:02] a window would you like to address them
[41:05] sure
[41:06] let's see if i can pull that up
[41:09] i can't see it oh this is annoying i
[41:11] can't see it unless i
[41:13] uh
[41:16] i think i can't see it unless i stop
[41:18] sharing my screen okay uh let me um greg
[41:22] will greg will relay the question to you
[41:25] that sounds good
[41:27] great okay okay here
[41:29] i was muted i got i got uh
[41:32] internet our internet decided to stop
[41:34] working halfway through the talk
[41:36] um
[41:37] so i got kicked out and i am back now um
[41:40] my name is greg matthews um i i just
[41:43] want to introduce myself really quickly
[41:45] um i'm a uh i'm actually a uconn alum i
[41:48] did my phd there
[41:49] um i actually had uh
[41:52] dr yan was my professor for mathematical
[41:54] statistics uh both for first and second
[41:57] semester um and now i'm an associate
[41:59] professor of statistics at loyola
[42:01] university of chicago
[42:02] uh and i live in the best city in
[42:04] america chicago um
[42:07] so uh let's let's start with some
[42:08] questions can i'm gonna go first because
[42:10] i'm the i get to i have that power so um
[42:14] tom i was
[42:15] in those in those plots you showed about
[42:16] penalties it looks like there's a big
[42:18] increase in around 2012 or 2013.
[42:22] um
[42:23] look if you look at delay of gay or um
[42:25] defensive holding and neutral zone
[42:26] infraction it looks like there's there's
[42:29] this increase is happening sort of at
[42:30] the same time around 2012 2013. was
[42:33] there some league-wide um
[42:36] was there some rules changes that
[42:38] happened or was there some mandate from
[42:39] the league to call these penalties more
[42:41] uh around that time can you talk about
[42:43] that a little
[42:44] so so it's a combination yes up so to
[42:46] answer your question yes but it's a
[42:48] combination of a few things
[42:49] one um neutral zone infractions in
[42:52] particular we we're calling more neutral
[42:54] zone infractions in the league uh
[42:56] partially for quarterback safety i don't
[42:58] know if you guys maybe remember in 2010
[43:01] you can picture aaron rodgers
[43:03] drawing players offside and then
[43:05] throwing it deep that's not as often
[43:08] anymore they're blown dead typically
[43:10] unless
[43:11] um so so defenders won't get a free shot
[43:13] at the quarterback um defensive holding
[43:16] i think there's just been more of a
[43:18] sort of focus on making sure those are
[43:20] called correctly so that's part of the
[43:22] reason why but another big reason is
[43:24] we're seeing a lot more plays per game
[43:25] the the the league has become used to be
[43:27] more of a running league now it's more
[43:29] of a passing league which is good in my
[43:31] opinion but the with more passing
[43:34] there's gonna be more incomplete passes
[43:35] more time stoppages and then also more
[43:37] scoring um so there's gonna be more
[43:39] plays per game and teams are also
[43:41] snapping at um with more time on the
[43:43] play clock they're not just trying to
[43:45] play possession football so with more
[43:46] plays you're gonna get more penalties
[43:49] because there's just more opportunities
[43:50] to commit
[43:52] okay um
[43:55] here's a question from i'm trying to i'm
[43:57] trying to do this in order um
[43:59] they're coming up in a strange order
[44:01] here let's see if we can go back to find
[44:03] the earliest one all right here's here's
[44:04] a question from zach binkley uh hi how
[44:08] are you considering nutritional science
[44:10] into this individual nutrition plays a
[44:11] role in recovery along with travel is
[44:13] that something you're considering at all
[44:16] hi um so
[44:18] that is not something we're considering
[44:20] uh one thing about that is
[44:23] i guess the way we might consider that
[44:26] is we i don't we don't have measurements
[44:28] of how good or how teams are doing
[44:30] nutritional science
[44:32] we could possibly maybe have a a team
[44:34] specific rest advantage maybe some teams
[44:37] because they are good at nutritional
[44:39] science um they they have some sort of
[44:42] bonus rest advantage or some less
[44:44] recipient maybe they're not good at
[44:45] nutritional science
[44:46] the issue with that is that just creates
[44:48] very small sample sizes and it's it's
[44:50] impossible to know like does this team
[44:53] have the same nutritional sciences
[44:54] scientists from five years ago are they
[44:56] changing i mean
[44:58] we actually maybe at the league we have
[44:59] that written down somewhere but it would
[45:02] really
[45:03] shrink the sample sizes most teams will
[45:05] only have
[45:07] four
[45:07] five max
[45:09] sort of rest advantages or disadvantages
[45:11] per season
[45:12] um it really wouldn't make sense for us
[45:15] to even i mean using just rest across
[45:17] all seasons i think we we have enough
[45:19] but to have to drink it specific to team
[45:21] i don't think that would really work and
[45:23] yeah we don't have a measurement of
[45:25] teams uh strength and nutritional
[45:27] science and maybe if we did we could
[45:29] incorporate it
[45:30] thank you all right this is a question
[45:32] uh from trevor anderson your first view
[45:34] is mr bliss which means you're old now
[45:36] um
[45:37] do you think that postponing of games
[45:39] due to covet tests for example the the
[45:41] bills game on tuesday now can affect the
[45:43] players and do you think that playing an
[45:45] abnormal uh playing on an abnormal game
[45:47] day will affect the players at all
[45:50] yeah those are great questions um so i
[45:53] mean i i i don't know i won't i'm not
[45:54] sure about conditions specific to covet
[45:56] we haven't really analyzed this season
[45:59] but in terms of the fact just
[46:01] a team plane on a tuesday absolutely i
[46:04] mean we found
[46:05] that rest advantages do matter and i
[46:08] believe the the bills are playing on
[46:09] tuesday and they're playing the chiefs
[46:10] on on saturday or sunday the following
[46:12] week that is a big
[46:16] uh that's a disadvantage to the bills
[46:18] um
[46:19] and who are the bill the bills are
[46:21] playing the titans the titans haven't
[46:22] played in a few weeks they have
[46:24] basically have a better buy advantage
[46:26] that also is a disadvantage to this so
[46:28] absolutely um playing on those abnormal
[46:31] times will affect in terms of rest
[46:33] advantage we don't have that much data
[46:36] in terms of like this tuesday night
[46:38] football matter
[46:39] just because i think there's only been
[46:41] one tuesday night game since within our
[46:43] data center one in 2010 like eagles
[46:45] vikings but that because they're so
[46:47] uncommon i can't really speak to tuesday
[46:49] night in specific
[46:50] specific
[46:51] but
[46:53] i do think that there are going to be
[46:55] some rest advantage and disadvantages
[46:56] felt by the bills chiefs and titans
[47:00] thank you um this is from this is
[47:02] another question from alex alexander
[47:04] harriman um and they are this is an
[47:06] undergraduate at clemson university and
[47:08] uh i hear they have a they have a
[47:10] football team down there um
[47:12] he's wondering uh i was wondering how
[47:14] you decided on the style of model you
[47:16] chose for your study
[47:18] yeah i actually have a slide in the
[47:21] appendix about that so
[47:23] um this is i didn't want to get too into
[47:25] it during the presentation it's a bit
[47:26] mathy but
[47:28] um we wanted to use the gibbs sampling
[47:30] model for for three key reasons
[47:32] uh one it allows for week to week season
[47:35] to season interaction of team strength
[47:37] so
[47:38] those data scientists out there i mean
[47:41] even think about linear regression
[47:42] you're supposed to have independence of
[47:44] each sort of row each row is not
[47:46] supposed to affect each other however in
[47:48] our case we know that
[47:50] the
[47:51] 2019 week one chiefs
[47:53] have an interaction with the 2019 week
[47:55] two chiefs which have an interaction
[47:56] with the 2019 week three chiefs and also
[47:58] the 2018 chiefs in general of
[48:00] interaction with the 2019 chiefs they're
[48:02] not you're not putting on a totally
[48:03] different football team with new coaches
[48:05] and new players each week there
[48:07] there's interaction although they're not
[48:08] exactly the same so that that's one
[48:10] reason
[48:11] um another reason is we have
[48:13] a bunch of probability distributions for
[48:15] each variable they have different
[48:17] probability distributions um i can get
[48:19] deeper into that if people want but
[48:22] we have their their joint conditional
[48:24] probability distributions
[48:26] um i don't i could i don't want to do a
[48:29] full lecture on that and maybe not even
[48:30] the most equipped person to do that but
[48:33] because of that that's another advantage
[48:35] um and in the general process of this is
[48:37] where
[48:38] it's like coordinate ascent coordinate
[48:40] this descent expectation maximization if
[48:43] you happen to know any of those
[48:44] we're sort of allowing one bit we're
[48:46] sampling from one variable then learning
[48:48] from it and sampling from another and
[48:49] then learning form and they're the
[48:51] variables are sort of working together
[48:52] and adjusting together and um for that
[48:55] reason it worked out really well better
[48:57] than like a simple linear model or even
[49:00] a tree based model
[49:02] thank you um this is a really
[49:04] interesting question this is from uh
[49:05] celine eunal um
[49:08] and they say i i'm wondering about the
[49:10] transformation of the difference in days
[49:12] of rest into a categorical variable in
[49:14] soccer there is this idea that too much
[49:16] rest is a problem as no training can
[49:18] truly replace competitive games so i
[49:21] think the question here is about how
[49:23] um
[49:24] i believe the way you've included
[49:26] um the way you've included your rest
[49:29] variable and you're not you're not
[49:31] um you're not
[49:32] i don't think you'll allow for the rest
[49:35] to ever get worse
[49:36] in terms it'll always be like the more
[49:38] rest you get the better off you are um
[49:40] and if you
[49:41] convert it to a categorical variable you
[49:43] would be allowing for maybe a point
[49:45] where after that it's too much rest
[49:47] um do you want to talk about that a
[49:49] little bit yeah yeah yeah so i mean so
[49:51] so maybe the rest is treated as a
[49:54] categorical variable
[49:56] i mean and and then part of it was we
[49:59] i i didn't instruct i didn't tell the
[50:01] model okay this has to be positive this
[50:03] has to be negative i let the model
[50:05] figure it out and the model found that
[50:06] it was positive
[50:08] i i absolutely would agree if you have
[50:10] too much rest that probably is a
[50:11] disadvantage and i'm sure that exists in
[50:13] football however during the regular
[50:15] season there isn't a situation where
[50:17] it's more than seven or eight days
[50:19] um so because of that we feel that
[50:22] um it like it probably wouldn't be an
[50:26] issue
[50:27] based on our measurements we are in our
[50:29] estimates we found that
[50:31] it that's not the case um i i agree that
[50:33] in principle that probably is the case
[50:35] at a certain point but uh we don't
[50:37] really have data where that would
[50:38] suggest that
[50:42] okay oh there was there was follow-ups
[50:44] that i didn't well let me ask this other
[50:46] question uh this is from mike templeton
[50:48] um how did your data take into account
[50:50] when teams that stayed out in in west
[50:52] coast if they played two weeks
[50:55] it played the rams and the chargers back
[50:57] to back and they stayed out on the west
[50:59] coast so it might look like there's
[51:00] travel but there there wasn't actually
[51:02] you account for that
[51:03] that's a really good point no we did not
[51:05] account for that um
[51:07] we would ideally we would like to it
[51:10] just would be
[51:11] it was we don't have that data
[51:14] present um maybe we should but it we
[51:17] couldn't figure out um yeah we just we
[51:20] it would have been too much it would
[51:21] have just been a bunch of googling and
[51:23] figuring out what actual team schedules
[51:25] are and it just didn't really seem to
[51:28] be worth the time
[51:29] of doing that
[51:31] it's not particularly
[51:32] common you'd have to play two visiting
[51:35] teams sort of back to back
[51:37] uh
[51:39] that are nearby each other
[51:42] that's a good question though
[51:44] okay
[51:45] um
[51:47] i think i butchered celine's question
[51:48] i'm gonna try to ask this again because
[51:50] i didn't read the
[51:51] uh the rest of this um
[51:55] so the the like the follow-up was uh do
[51:58] you think information is lost by
[51:59] transforming the rest days first into a
[52:01] difference then into a categorical
[52:02] variable so maybe rest days being 3
[52:05] versus 6 is different than 12 versus 15
[52:08] or it might even be that rest days being
[52:10] six
[52:16] yes versus
[52:18] i think that's a different question than
[52:19] i was originally asking does that make
[52:21] sense though yeah yeah that does make
[52:23] sense that's a that that's a really good
[52:24] question so we did try it linearly
[52:27] difference of rest stays linearly uh but
[52:30] that is a good point i mean maybe
[52:33] maybe that maybe it's almost like each
[52:35] of like
[52:36] it's not like a linear maybe difference
[52:38] isn't the best way to think about it um
[52:40] that's definitely something we can
[52:42] explore so i really like that idea uh
[52:44] but we did try difference linearly
[52:47] um
[52:48] the difficulty though and unfortunately
[52:51] is in terms of doing like three versus
[52:53] six might be different than
[52:55] like four versus seven
[52:57] uh different difficulties the sample
[52:59] size is a little bit
[53:01] smaller the sample size is not that big
[53:04] to begin with
[53:05] um and that again would sort of be an
[53:06] issue or would be shrinking the sample
[53:07] size but i would agree in general that
[53:09] that could have
[53:11] an effect uh different and i think
[53:14] that's a really good point
[53:17] thank you tom here's there's
[53:19] we got a i think about eight eight
[53:20] minutes left for questions seven minutes
[53:21] left for questions tom and i'm just
[53:22] gonna keep i'm just gonna keep asking
[53:24] them
[53:26] yeah this is a question a question from
[53:28] chris schwarm um i'm not sure if you
[53:30] keep data on crowd volume but do you see
[53:32] larger amounts of delay of gain slash
[53:34] neutral zone infractions in favor of the
[53:36] home team and stadiums that are like uh
[53:38] considered to be louder
[53:40] um
[53:42] i would have met i think not so so we've
[53:45] done that analysis before
[53:47] i i believe the answer is yes uh don't
[53:50] quote me on that uh i'd necessarily do
[53:52] this analysis do that analysis for this
[53:54] um but i i definitely think that would
[53:58] be the case i can i can double check
[54:00] that uh but yeah i i mean
[54:02] there definitely is an interaction
[54:04] between crowd noise and um delay of game
[54:08] uh i didn't measure it for this however
[54:10] um
[54:11] yeah
[54:13] thank you uh this is a question from
[54:14] jeremiah alago i'm a little curious
[54:17] about the effect of weather on these
[54:18] games have you conducted uh have you
[54:20] had do you have data on the difference
[54:22] of indoor or outdoor stadiums or how
[54:24] severe weather conditions might benefit
[54:26] a team that is more used to them so like
[54:28] if if you're a dome team and you go and
[54:29] travel and you go play at lambo in
[54:31] january
[54:32] um
[54:34] have you considered that kind of effect
[54:35] at all
[54:36] yes yes we have uh we we tried using
[54:39] adding weather um as an effect we didn't
[54:42] find we didn't do it too deeply uh we we
[54:45] just tried adding it um
[54:48] i think i think what maybe we had like
[54:49] condition or temperature it wasn't that
[54:52] deep of an analysis
[54:54] part of it was we're not actually that
[54:56] interested in whether or not the weather
[54:59] we don't care about the magnitude of
[55:00] weather i mean the what like
[55:02] as a league we can control rest travel
[55:04] home we can control those sort of
[55:06] advantages
[55:07] i have no control whether it's going to
[55:09] be snowy in lambeau in january uh that
[55:13] that is not something i can do
[55:15] so in a way it's not even of our
[55:16] interest but we did sort of briefly look
[55:19] into it just in case there was a really
[55:21] strong signal and it's something we're
[55:23] not accounting for but uh as i recall we
[55:26] didn't find it strong enough to to keep
[55:29] it
[55:31] um this is uh thank you tom this is a i
[55:34] think this is a really interesting
[55:35] question um and this shows kind of this
[55:38] is one of the benefits of living in the
[55:39] world we're living in right now um this
[55:41] is a question from amir who is a
[55:43] master's student in data science from
[55:45] israel
[55:46] um
[55:47] uh so we're like we're all over the
[55:48] world right now time it's great um
[55:51] uh it seems you used bayesian inference
[55:53] so my question is whether you whether
[55:54] you have tried modeling rest and
[55:56] distance uh advantage for offense and
[55:58] defense separately
[56:00] so
[56:01] he
[56:01] they're asking about whether
[56:03] um
[56:04] the the the rest could have different
[56:06] effects on offense and defense it could
[56:08] be different effects for different units
[56:11] um and then they also say uh perhaps
[56:13] using perhaps using the actual score
[56:15] line
[56:16] um instead of instead of the uh the
[56:19] spread
[56:20] yeah so um
[56:22] yeah that that last part of the question
[56:24] was sort of where i was going to go to
[56:25] just start yeah so we since we want
[56:28] probability
[56:29] um and we actually use the money line uh
[56:31] to get it because that's a little bit
[56:32] more exact of a probability than a
[56:34] spread uh but we're only using the
[56:36] probability we don't actually
[56:38] did
[56:39] but we're not going to
[56:41] score it about home team expected points
[56:44] allowed by the
[56:45] vice versa i definitely think that
[56:47] there's a there's a chance that that
[56:49] could be the the case
[56:59] yeah so definitely the um
[57:03] we i i could definitely see that being
[57:05] the case and we'd probably have to maybe
[57:06] we would use a combination of the spread
[57:08] and the over under
[57:09] maybe we just used the points scored um
[57:12] that that that definitely um could have
[57:14] been affected but that's not something
[57:15] we've looked into
[57:18] all right we're having a little bit of a
[57:19] there's a little bit of a meltdown
[57:20] happening down the hall right now see
[57:22] some children um but so here's another
[57:25] question we have about uh three minutes
[57:27] left this is from nate rowan uh he says
[57:30] thank you for the presentation i agree
[57:31] with that tom um what is the approximate
[57:34] value of a single point in terms of
[57:36] implied wind probability
[57:38] um a single point i think it's around um
[57:42] maybe it's about one percent let me try
[57:44] to think
[57:45] um
[57:46] i know rest what rest actually it's
[57:49] probably more than that because i know
[57:50] remember rest
[57:51] advantage i think is about one percent
[57:53] and
[57:54] um by advantage is about two percent so
[57:56] maybe point like what one point would be
[57:59] about three percent i think although
[58:01] it's not a linear relationship
[58:03] um
[58:05] yeah i i i i did have this in terms of
[58:09] uh percentages at one point but i uh
[58:11] felt points was better but maybe i could
[58:13] keep both um for the future
[58:16] and then home advantage is about seven
[58:18] or eight percent um so it's probably
[58:20] about point three three points is about
[58:22] a percent but again it's not a linear
[58:24] relationship so it won't work out
[58:25] perfectly that way
[58:27] right yeah because you're on you're on
[58:28] the log out the you're on the log on
[58:30] scale right yes right so it won't be
[58:33] you can't just say that
[58:35] yeah yeah okay
[58:36] yes
[58:37] it's linear in the log odds all right
[58:39] yes when you're on the log scale that's
[58:41] true that's it uh this is from chrissy
[58:43] chrissy sybil or cybel uh do you think
[58:46] the effect of bye weeks will be
[58:48] different this season since some teams
[58:50] are having their bye weeks moved for
[58:51] example i saw the steelers kind of lost
[58:53] the day of their bye week because they
[58:54] were still practicing before they knew
[58:56] it was moved that's an interesting
[58:58] question that's a really interesting
[58:59] question um i mean we're well we'll look
[59:02] into that after the season again we
[59:04] don't have enough data on that quite yet
[59:06] but that's definitely something that
[59:08] we'll we'll look into after the season
[59:12] okay
[59:13] that is an interesting question because
[59:14] you're like you're mentally prepared to
[59:15] have a bye week this week and then all
[59:16] of a sudden it's your whole schedule the
[59:18] whole season has changed no yes
[59:20] sometimes actually just take the week
[59:22] off or a lot of the days of the week
[59:23] after in the bye week and they were
[59:24] going into practice expecting
[59:26] so yeah yeah that's that's interesting
[59:28] um
[59:29] uh
[59:30] [Music]
[59:31] says uh very interesting research any
[59:34] plan to apply your research in nfl and
[59:36] future nfl scheduling for even more
[59:38] balancing
[59:39] uh between home and away teams for even
[59:41] more competitive games
[59:43] yeah i mean so
[59:45] our group doesn't do the schedule but
[59:47] our group works with the scheduling team
[59:49] uh closely and we we give this
[59:51] information to them and that um and they
[59:54] do a great job but uh they have it's a
[59:57] it's a thankless job of making the nfl
[59:59] schedule because there's networks teams
[60:02] uh
[60:04] leagues uh like stadiums all sort of
[60:07] wanting one thing and
[60:09] something else wanting another thing but
[60:11] absolutely we share this information
[60:13] with them and um they
[60:15] they do with it what they what they want
[60:18] thank you uh well then alexander
[60:20] harriman said we do have a football team
[60:21] it's been pretty good lately yeah
[60:22] everyone gets it clemson comes and wins
[60:24] football games great congratulations
[60:27] for you okay um
[60:29] uh this is from billy fryer uh hi my
[60:32] name is billy fryer i'm an undergraduate
[60:34] at uh
[60:36] how did you factor in games on holidays
[60:37] such as thanksgiving and christmas or
[60:39] were these treated like normal thursday
[60:41] games you were treated like normal
[60:43] thursday games and again i hate to keep
[60:46] using the same answer
[60:47] there's only 256 games a season and not
[60:49] every season we even have um
[60:53] christmas games
[60:55] i mean we do have three thanksgiving
[60:56] games every season maybe i can do
[60:58] something with that but also another
[61:00] difficulty with that is the same two two
[61:02] of the same teams play every year and
[61:03] they typically play a division rival so
[61:05] it's a recycling of teams that really
[61:07] play in those thanksgiving windows
[61:08] that's one problem with it but yeah we
[61:11] don't really have a big enough sample
[61:12] size and again we're not
[61:14] i mean maybe that would be of interest
[61:16] maybe if there's a disadvantage i'm
[61:17] playing on a holiday uh that is
[61:20] something we'd have to take into account
[61:21] but
[61:23] um yeah for now we just treat it as
[61:24] normal thursday games
[61:29] i think you're muted greg
[61:31] oh yes i i am muted because there's
[61:33] still a uh meltdown happening but you
[61:36] know when you have four year olds
[61:37] there's meltdowns every 15 minutes
[61:39] um i've gone one minute over june's
[61:42] furious with me he's gonna be so angry
[61:44] um
[61:45] we've we're one minute behind on the
[61:46] schedule so um
[61:48] i'm gonna stop the questions there um
[61:51] and i'm going to say thank you tom that
[61:53] was a great talk uh thank you for
[61:55] listening yeah and i'm gonna um
[61:58] i'm gonna pass it back
