[00:02] i have long been a data driven
[00:04] storyteller in media
[00:06] and i recently joined the seattle kraken
[00:08] as a contributor at their website and
[00:10] their tv analyst for game broadcast and
[00:13] i'm thrilled to be welcoming three other
[00:16] women in the sports analytics industry
[00:19] um we're going to talk about careers in
[00:21] sport analytics and i've shared this
[00:24] with some of you i just want to
[00:25] encourage each of you please i don't
[00:26] need this to be i ask a question you
[00:28] answer we want to have as much of a
[00:30] dialogue interrupt me ask each other
[00:32] questions let's see what we can learn
[00:33] from one another
[00:34] let me introduce our panelists i'm going
[00:36] to do a brief introduction and then
[00:38] we'll let each of these fine people tell
[00:39] you their path to where they are today
[00:42] um first we have jessica hensley and
[00:45] jessica is a data analyst with the
[00:47] united states olympic and para olympic
[00:50] committee committee excuse me she's been
[00:52] there for two years
[00:53] um and she has been in tokyo recently
[00:56] she graduated from emory and henry
[00:58] college with a degree in mathematics and
[01:01] also has interned at espn and in the
[01:03] meantime also got a master's degree in
[01:05] statistical data science from florida
[01:08] state university welcome jessica
[01:10] we also have kelsey roberts kelsey is a
[01:13] database and basketball analyst for the
[01:15] new york knicks
[01:17] she's also worked with the pacers in
[01:18] indiana the miami heat and she has a
[01:21] bachelor's in international business
[01:23] from xavier university and a masters in
[01:26] statistics from the university of
[01:27] arkansas
[01:28] and last but certainly not least is
[01:30] sarah ziegler the sports editor at 538
[01:34] she's also the host of the hot takedown
[01:36] podcast which is a fun great listen
[01:38] she's a native of south dakota and an
[01:40] alumna of iowa iowa state university
[01:43] welcome kelsey sarah and jessica um
[01:47] again i'm here just to keep the
[01:48] conversation going we'll go around the
[01:50] group to start because i'd really like
[01:52] our
[01:53] attendees to hear from each of you the
[01:56] path that you took to getting where you
[01:58] are today we can talk about where
[01:59] someone graduates from we can talk about
[02:00] a job title but three of us have
[02:03] analysts in our title and it probably
[02:04] means something different to everyone so
[02:06] jessica maybe you can start and talk us
[02:08] through maybe when that first interest
[02:10] in analytics or data started for you and
[02:12] and your path to where you are today
[02:15] yeah so
[02:17] i grew up in a small town in florida
[02:18] honestly where
[02:20] you didn't really there wasn't many
[02:22] career options um that were known to you
[02:25] as a high school student i went to
[02:27] college thinking i would be a math
[02:28] teacher and a swim coach um because
[02:31] honestly as a female who loved math like
[02:33] that's what you did in my town um i got
[02:36] to college and my honors director
[02:39] actually was like i think that you
[02:40] should really look at statistics and
[02:42] maybe try an internship and see see
[02:44] where that takes you um i think that you
[02:47] would like something outside of teaching
[02:49] not that that's not a great career but i
[02:51] think that you would actually really
[02:52] enjoy
[02:53] being doing some data analytics so
[02:56] i first interned at a statistical
[02:58] consulting firm called elder research
[03:00] and that i self-taught myself are there
[03:03] and really just
[03:05] loved everything i loved that you could
[03:07] actually use math and statistics and
[03:10] apply it to the real world um so the big
[03:12] project i worked on there was it was in
[03:14] baltimore and the baltimore riots were
[03:16] happening that summer and twitter
[03:17] actually knew about the riots before the
[03:19] police did
[03:20] so our client wanted to create a anomaly
[03:24] detection system through twitter
[03:27] using tweets to identify anytime
[03:29] sentiment kind of turned angry or bad
[03:32] and create a
[03:34] alert to send them to tweets
[03:36] um twitter was also booming at that time
[03:38] and so that was
[03:40] the project and i just loved being able
[03:41] to apply
[03:43] what i could do to the real world so
[03:45] from there on one of the projects they
[03:47] actually gave me was nfl uh super bowl
[03:50] data and
[03:52] i was i was caught there like that's all
[03:54] i wanted from then on i went to sloan
[03:56] the next year and my eyes were just open
[03:59] to the whole world of possibilities
[04:00] within sports analytics
[04:02] so that's when i looked for internships
[04:04] i applied to probably thousands of
[04:06] internships for the next summer
[04:08] got one as a business analyst with the
[04:11] hornets and
[04:12] got to work on ticket pricing scheduling
[04:15] um nba schedule recommendations lots of
[04:17] really cool things that had actual
[04:20] implications which
[04:22] is what i just fell in love with um then
[04:24] went to espn was a stats and information
[04:27] group intern there
[04:29] loved that world too but really thought
[04:31] i wanted to go more into the sport
[04:32] performance world either basketball ops
[04:34] analytics because
[04:36] timing of graduation for me was when nba
[04:39] analytics was really taking off
[04:41] but decided to go to florida state just
[04:43] because my undergrad was only a math
[04:46] major um they did not have statistics at
[04:48] my undergrad it was a very small school
[04:50] they did not have computer science like
[04:52] even like a class so i was completely
[04:55] self-taught
[04:56] and decided i should get some more
[04:58] formal training uh i went and did a
[05:00] statistical data science program to get
[05:02] a little bit more formal training in
[05:03] statistics and data science
[05:05] and a opportunity came up on teamwork
[05:07] that was a data analyst for the u.s
[05:09] olympic and paralympic committee and
[05:12] the idea of it immediately i was caught
[05:14] i was like this is what i want to do
[05:16] this is the perfect place for me i was a
[05:18] swimmer all throughout college
[05:20] i can do swimming i can do track i can
[05:21] do bobsled skill i can do all these
[05:23] other cool sports that don't really have
[05:26] analytics yet um
[05:28] super involved with them
[05:29] so i didn't actually get the first job
[05:32] because they needed someone like five
[05:34] months before i graduated but i kept in
[05:36] touch with them and
[05:38] a job opening happened to come in
[05:39] december and i graduated at the end of
[05:41] december and moved on across the
[05:45] across the country a couple weeks later
[05:48] amazing amazing
[05:50] well speaking of a sport nba where data
[05:53] is booming kelsey share your story with
[05:55] us and how you got to where you are
[05:56] today
[05:57] yes so i have to say i think mine's a
[06:00] little different because when i was in
[06:02] high school i took um ap statistics and
[06:05] computer science and i hated it i was
[06:08] like i never want to do anything with
[06:10] this i'm not good at it i i like as soon
[06:13] as i left high school i was like i'm not
[06:15] doing anything related to math i'm
[06:17] staying away from it i'm so bad at this
[06:19] so in college i studied international
[06:21] business thinking i wanted to do like
[06:23] marketing or you know i had no idea what
[06:26] i wanted to do i was 18 like does anyone
[06:27] at 18 really know what they want to do
[06:29] right so um got a degree in
[06:31] international business and worked in
[06:33] that field so i worked for the company
[06:34] that makes like jergens lotion
[06:36] curable lotion biore skin care consumer
[06:39] packaged goods essentially and um when i
[06:42] got that job some of my friends
[06:44] were still in college i graduated a year
[06:46] early and were in stats class and uh i
[06:49] was tutoring them in it because i did
[06:51] well and i did well in ap stats i just
[06:53] hated it and uh and in college so when i
[06:56] started tutoring them in stats i kind of
[06:59] like i liked it then
[07:01] i was teaching people stats and i
[07:03] thought still i was like i'm never going
[07:05] to do anything with this like i'm just
[07:06] going to help them not fail the class
[07:09] and then one of my co-workers and i
[07:11] decided to take there's a group called
[07:13] girl develop it
[07:15] that kind of teaches different coding
[07:16] classes so when i was in my first job
[07:18] out of college i took a class with her
[07:20] during the week after work for fun like
[07:22] building websites and that's when i
[07:24] loved coding in high school i took c
[07:27] plus and i was like i never want to
[07:28] touch this ever again this is miserable
[07:31] um
[07:32] and then so i kind of found out like my
[07:34] passions for it when i wasn't in a
[07:35] school environment and i could do it for
[07:37] fun
[07:38] um and so then i moved to arkansas to
[07:40] work on the walmart account for my
[07:42] company and it was when i was there that
[07:43] i thought maybe i want to get a degree
[07:45] in stats like i've been helping my
[07:47] friends with stats class and i kind of
[07:49] missed
[07:50] um
[07:51] like in a lot of times in work someone
[07:53] would say something like oh then you
[07:55] know the sales are significantly higher
[07:57] than this and i would say is it though
[07:59] like
[07:59] statistically
[08:01] i would have like this like anytime
[08:03] someone would say that like wins and no
[08:05] it wasn't anything math related um so
[08:07] that kind of encouraged me to go back
[08:09] and from there um i was just kind of
[08:11] looking online for internships in that
[08:13] field and came across um ironically
[08:16] hornets and pacers and i applied to both
[08:18] one in business analytics and one in
[08:20] basketball analytics ended up getting
[08:22] both offers and then deciding to go to
[08:24] the pacers because i had already done
[08:26] business analytics and was ready to see
[08:28] what the basketball ops world would be
[08:29] like i'd always loved basketball i never
[08:31] thought i would ever work in it because
[08:33] i didn't like math uh in high school but
[08:36] after i got that internship that's when
[08:38] i really fell in love with it and from
[08:39] there um i kind of from there it led
[08:42] into my heat internship and i will say
[08:45] too i never want the networking route i
[08:47] just applied online to everything
[08:49] applied online to the pacers got it
[08:50] miami heat applied online and didn't
[08:53] know anybody got that same with the new
[08:54] york knicks after i finished grad school
[08:57] there i think i found it on linkedin um
[08:59] because someone had just left and i
[09:00] applied like really not knowing anybody
[09:02] there or knowing anything about that
[09:04] team or who worked there and uh
[09:06] interviewed and uh so i'm going into my
[09:08] second season with the knicks now
[09:11] that's amazing the internet is not right
[09:13] now
[09:14] don't put mine
[09:17] the internet is good for something i
[09:18] love
[09:19] these different paths sarah i'm so
[09:21] excited to hear you share your story
[09:23] because you're looking at sport and
[09:25] analytics through a different lens so
[09:27] tell us your story
[09:28] yeah my um my path is uh to this job has
[09:32] been a very very strange one and very
[09:34] different um uh from jessica and kelsey
[09:37] although uh i did um i started out in
[09:40] college as an engineering major and
[09:41] switched to journalism like i don't know
[09:44] half a semester in i was like right away
[09:46] i was like oh no i don't i don't want to
[09:48] do this um but but it's funny that i
[09:51] come back to that kind of um
[09:53] mindset now now in a statistical
[09:56] environment so so i was a journalist i i
[09:58] wanted to be a journalist um
[10:00] and i was an editor uh really almost
[10:03] almost from the word jump i had a couple
[10:06] of uh reporting internships and realized
[10:08] i didn't i thought it was very important
[10:10] but not something i wanted to do so i
[10:12] was a copy editor coming out of college
[10:13] and and worked for a newspaper for many
[10:16] many many years and really
[10:19] for
[10:20] you know i went to college at a time
[10:22] before the sports analytics
[10:25] um craze really like really back in back
[10:27] in back in the 90s um there wasn't this
[10:30] kind of focus on analytics it was like
[10:32] bill james and like that was it you know
[10:34] um so they're really you know i loved
[10:35] sports but i didn't really know that
[10:37] there was that path there wasn't that
[10:39] path quite yet
[10:40] so so i was a journalist forever um and
[10:44] and i got into
[10:46] uh
[10:47] sports analytics because
[10:50] um so i was i was like in my in my early
[10:53] 20s i was in a strange city i was um in
[10:57] a fantasy baseball league with a lot of
[10:59] guys that i didn't know very well who
[11:03] didn't uh think that i
[11:05] didn't take me very seriously as a
[11:06] fantasy baseball player um let's just
[11:08] say and that uh fueled me and i wanted
[11:12] to beat them all very badly and that's
[11:15] when i found baseball prospectus and i
[11:17] started reading nate silver back in like
[11:19] 2003 when he was just doing baseball
[11:21] blogging um i find that hilarious now as
[11:24] my career has turned out but that's how
[11:26] i started really getting into
[11:28] understanding um on you know baseball
[11:31] statistics and then another advanced
[11:32] stats so so i um i i was an editor for
[11:36] many years in
[11:38] omaha nebraska um as newspapers have
[11:41] done what they have done
[11:43] my husband and i decided you know what
[11:44] we don't have to live um in nebraska
[11:47] anymore our jobs at the newspaper may
[11:49] not exist in another couple of years
[11:51] let's leave so we decided to move to new
[11:53] york and see what happened and um i
[11:56] managed to uh i applied at after a few
[11:59] months in a different job i applied it
[12:01] for a job at 538 and got that and i
[12:03] started at 538 as a general editor
[12:05] um we're a very small shop i really
[12:08] loved sports and um was you know
[12:10] interested in in reading about sports so
[12:12] i got pushed into the sports um realm i
[12:15] became the assistant sports editor and
[12:16] then two years ago now um the then
[12:19] sports editor left and and i was
[12:21] promoted to the sports editor job so
[12:23] it's a really different kind of a path
[12:25] into
[12:26] caring a lot now about sports analytics
[12:29] that's awesome that's and you know it's
[12:31] it's funny i was going to ask this
[12:32] question but kelsey your story
[12:34] really brought this home to me
[12:37] i'd like to ask the group and kelsey
[12:38] will have you go first you know i think
[12:40] a lot of times when people start
[12:42] thinking about oh i love math i love
[12:44] sports i love this specific sport and i
[12:47] want to work in it right and sometimes
[12:49] we do want to work in the sport and
[12:51] sometimes we don't so that's the first
[12:53] part of this question um because kelsey
[12:55] you came back into basketball but then
[12:57] also given that you were doing more
[12:59] marketing focused data work at first
[13:02] i'd love to hear from you and kelsey
[13:03] again you're first just thoughts on you
[13:06] know there's there's statistical
[13:07] understanding and education and skill we
[13:10] need
[13:10] and then there's domain expertise right
[13:12] the sport in which we are working
[13:15] share what you have learned and what
[13:17] your opinion is on when you're looking
[13:19] for career in sport analytics how do you
[13:21] balance that can you come strong in one
[13:23] build up the other should you be
[13:24] building both just your thoughts kelsey
[13:26] on that and also again maybe going to a
[13:28] sport you love or don't love
[13:30] yeah i would say first and foremost is
[13:33] being in this job like
[13:36] technically there because if you don't
[13:37] have the coding ability i think you'd
[13:40] honestly drown um like when you when you
[13:42] first start you're kind of like thrown
[13:44] into it at least for the work that i i'm
[13:46] doing i think in general they want you
[13:48] to have the the hard skill set to do the
[13:50] job uh and i think before you get into
[13:53] the nba like for me it was my first
[13:55] internship with the pacers like you
[13:57] think you watch a lot of basketball and
[13:59] you think you know a lot about
[14:00] basketball and then you go into a
[14:02] meeting and you're like wow i know
[14:03] nothing like it's like this reality slap
[14:06] of you know people are saying things and
[14:08] you're like what are they talking about
[14:09] and i think that comes easier than
[14:11] coding then you know if you can do the
[14:13] technical work and you can figure out
[14:15] the models and you have that background
[14:17] i think it's easier to i mean at the
[14:19] pacers the first month i already learned
[14:21] so much from my boss who was just
[14:23] brilliant
[14:24] and could explain you know like to the
[14:26] front office really well like what we
[14:28] were working on but i think being around
[14:29] them it's easier to pick up like these
[14:31] little things about basketball that they
[14:33] watch especially sitting next to them at
[14:34] the game you kind of like see things
[14:36] that they see and have been picking up
[14:38] for so long whereas i feel like if you
[14:40] don't have the technical skills in
[14:41] almost every
[14:42] position i applied to there was a
[14:44] technical assessment or they give you a
[14:45] coding project they give you um a stats
[14:48] project some type of coding that you
[14:50] have to show that you know what you're
[14:51] doing so i think if you're going to
[14:53] focus on anything
[14:55] obviously you have to know a little
[14:56] about basketball because it would be
[14:57] embarrassing if they like asked you
[14:58] about something you had no idea what
[14:59] you're talking about but i think more
[15:01] than anything it's easier to pick up the
[15:02] sport than it is um technical ability
[15:06] and jessica how about you because you're
[15:08] working across some sports you there was
[15:10] a sport you had an affinity for what is
[15:12] your opinion again on that technical
[15:14] versus domain expertise and also how do
[15:16] you build up one or both if you
[15:18] depending on what your opinion is
[15:20] yeah no i agree completely with kelsey i
[15:22] think you have to have the hard skills
[15:24] know what you're doing statistically
[15:26] coding wise everything like that
[15:28] very solid and then you have to have a
[15:30] baseline understanding of the sport you
[15:32] want to go into and as you
[15:34] definitely prepare for interviews and
[15:36] stuff you can definitely do your
[15:38] research on that side of things pretty
[15:39] quickly right you can research the team
[15:42] who they've been drafting and like all
[15:44] the background on the team to make sure
[15:45] you don't you know
[15:47] mess up saying something in an interview
[15:48] or they ask you about a player and you
[15:50] didn't hear about them or anything like
[15:52] that you can research that beforehand a
[15:54] lot easier than you could like kelsey
[15:56] said do an entire assessment
[15:58] and have no idea what you were doing um
[16:01] wouldn't go as well for me i work across
[16:04] every sport um so we have 61 different
[16:07] national governing bodies um and i rely
[16:10] on people within the sport to help with
[16:13] that knowledge i am not there's no way i
[16:15] could know the intricacies of every
[16:17] sport there is so what i do a lot of
[16:19] times is i do kind of a baseline
[16:21] analysis very
[16:23] baseline not too in depth or anything
[16:25] then i take that to a national governing
[16:28] body and work with them in conjunction
[16:30] with the experts in the sport and
[16:33] completely go in saying i don't know
[16:35] your sport like you do help me
[16:37] understand it help me understand what
[16:39] you need what you want to learn how i
[16:41] can help you and then i bring the
[16:43] statistical help to them but i'm not
[16:47] ever trying to act like i understand
[16:48] their sport or an expert in it that's
[16:51] their job
[16:52] um and so similar like if you're working
[16:55] with one sport you probably have to gain
[16:56] a pretty good understanding of it but in
[16:58] my world i can pick up on they can help
[17:01] me understand that piece i need to know
[17:03] the statistics and the coding to help
[17:05] them
[17:06] achieve what they're hoping to achieve
[17:09] sarah i'm so excited to hear your
[17:10] thoughts on this because you and i have
[17:12] to come at this in a different way
[17:14] you're looking across sports as well
[17:16] and if you're reporting on a sport i i
[17:19] feel like and correct me if i'm speaking
[17:21] here but you know we often have that if
[17:23] you don't know the sport well enough
[17:24] it's dismissed as the nerds don't know
[17:26] what they're saying
[17:27] and we also have to balance if we're not
[17:29] in a team
[17:31] it can we can't have passion for a team
[17:33] right we might be able to have a passion
[17:34] for a sport so what's your experience
[17:36] and your opinion on balancing domain
[17:38] knowledge and technical skill
[17:41] yeah i think
[17:42] the the key
[17:44] i mean technical skill obviously super
[17:46] super important but if you don't have
[17:48] that
[17:49] understanding of a sport a pretty
[17:52] you know more than just a rudimentary
[17:54] understanding of sport you don't know
[17:55] which questions to ask and and and which
[17:58] things to try to solve um and so that
[18:01] that can be
[18:02] a little tricky i think i think that um
[18:05] that
[18:06] you know it's true that that is easier
[18:07] to learn than like if you don't know if
[18:10] you don't know r you're not going to be
[18:11] able to do so like you're gonna you need
[18:14] to start there obviously but when you're
[18:15] getting into a sport especially if you
[18:17] don't have
[18:19] um you know a support staff that is
[18:21] really entrenched in a sport if you're
[18:22] kind of working on your own or if you're
[18:25] a writer and you're trying to cover you
[18:26] really are going to have to know that
[18:28] sport well to know which things to
[18:29] answer otherwise you're going to answer
[18:30] the same questions other people have or
[18:33] or you know pick up on something that is
[18:35] not important at all to the to the sport
[18:38] you know so that it is really hard and
[18:40] as we're working across a lot of sports
[18:42] it's it's you know you can tell when
[18:44] someone doesn't quite know what you know
[18:46] is sort of parachuting into a sport we
[18:48] really struggled we were very cognizant
[18:50] of that with our olympics coverage that
[18:52] we wanted to get people who are experts
[18:54] in each sport and not try to pretend
[18:56] that like
[18:57] i know everything about biathlon like no
[19:00] i do not i know nothing about it you
[19:02] know so really focusing on people who
[19:04] are experts there and we can help them
[19:06] with the statistical um you know the
[19:09] statistical work but someone who really
[19:11] truly understands the sport is just
[19:12] going to be such an expert on that from
[19:14] a from a writing and reporting
[19:16] standpoint
[19:18] it's so interesting and i i hope people
[19:19] are hearing what i what we're all saying
[19:21] too is that depending on the area where
[19:23] you're going to apply analytic and sport
[19:26] there's different levels right where you
[19:28] need that that domain expertise but also
[19:30] that technical skill
[19:32] some of you mentioned some of this and
[19:33] so i want to drill down
[19:35] further on we know what we're talking
[19:37] about we know what we're analyzing and
[19:38] sarah i'm going to go right back to you
[19:40] the importance of effective
[19:42] communication of the work you're doing
[19:44] and
[19:45] whether you're in an organization or
[19:48] formerly a communicator as a journalist
[19:51] what lessons have you learned what
[19:52] advice do you have again for our
[19:54] attendees today the importance of
[19:56] communication and techniques or
[19:58] important points to think about when
[20:00] you're trying to communicate statistical
[20:02] work in the sport field or statistical
[20:04] information in general sarah
[20:06] yeah you know this is the thing that um
[20:08] when i when i talk to people who want to
[20:11] want to work for a team don't want to be
[20:12] a journalist want to work you know want
[20:14] to be in sports analytics which i assume
[20:16] is most people here today the thing that
[20:18] i say every time is take a
[20:20] communications class in college because
[20:23] like nothing
[20:24] you could find
[20:26] you know you could solve
[20:28] nfl defense which if you do please give
[20:30] me a call i'd be very interested
[20:33] but if you can't explain it then it's
[20:35] not gonna do you any good you know that
[20:37] uh it's it's so important to be able to
[20:39] to talk to your front office about what
[20:41] why you're asking them to do a coach to
[20:44] take a different approach you know
[20:46] that's that's one of the hardest things
[20:48] right in our world is trying to get
[20:49] people who are old school and and you
[20:51] know know it when they see it or
[20:53] whatever we're like no no
[20:55] um but getting to being able to to
[20:58] communicate that i think is so important
[20:59] so so right for the school paper take a
[21:02] communications class learn how to
[21:04] communicate your ideas that will help
[21:06] you
[21:07] you know in many areas of your life but
[21:08] it will really i think make your your um
[21:11] your your statistical findings more
[21:14] effective and really be able to get your
[21:15] point across when you can communicate
[21:17] that i think that's super important
[21:20] kelsey the minute you shared the story
[21:21] of where someone would share something
[21:22] and you said are you sure about that
[21:24] you know you you were even challenging
[21:26] the communication that you were
[21:27] receiving right so what have you learned
[21:29] about taking data taking statistical
[21:31] analyses and just communication in
[21:33] general and then maybe there's something
[21:35] specific to sport as well
[21:38] yeah for me because i'm working with
[21:40] scouts a lot and you know people who are
[21:43] in charge of scouts like
[21:45] they
[21:47] they don't really care about the math
[21:49] they just want to know the answer so i
[21:51] think for me it's it's really just like
[21:53] dumbing it down and when i build a model
[21:56] uh if i know like the the college for
[21:59] the draft model for example like the
[22:01] college scouting group like uh it's
[22:04] better to build one that might be
[22:06] slightly less accurate like from a
[22:08] statistical standpoint that you can
[22:10] explain better because they say like you
[22:12] know why is this guy projected higher
[22:14] than this guy you can say oh because of
[22:16] these three variables like it weights
[22:18] them this way and they're pretty like in
[22:20] tune with that at this point they've
[22:22] been working in it for so long that they
[22:24] know that the math nerds coming in will
[22:26] have like some variable that they want
[22:28] to share um but i think for me
[22:30] because i'm working especially on the
[22:32] pro scouting side a lot of these guys
[22:33] were basketball players at some point
[22:35] and they know a lot about like the sport
[22:38] and how they're watching people and what
[22:39] skills they think they have so i always
[22:41] try to say like oh from an analytics
[22:43] perspective we see this guy is really
[22:44] good at this and sometimes they disagree
[22:46] sometimes they agree but i think for me
[22:49] like i try to stay away from
[22:51] the
[22:52] you know like math terminology because
[22:53] you just lose them and then they don't
[22:55] they're just
[22:56] they just glaze over and and it's like
[22:58] you lose that camaraderie and like the
[23:01] talks that you can have so for me it's
[23:03] like if they ask being able to like
[23:05] easily explain something but i try to
[23:08] keep it
[23:09] pretty high level with the with the
[23:11] stats talk usually
[23:14] jessica i'm fascinated to hear what you
[23:15] have to say because you already told us
[23:18] that you have to go to people and say i
[23:19] don't know this sport that well so what
[23:22] are lessons you've learned when maybe
[23:24] you are crossing more topics
[23:26] how do we effectively communicate the
[23:28] work that our data can help support or
[23:30] inform
[23:32] i feel like i heard this a lot in school
[23:34] but i see it every day is knowing your
[23:36] audience
[23:37] um specifically for me i could go to uh
[23:40] say usa swimming they actually have like
[23:42] three analysts in their in-house i can
[23:45] speak analytics to them i can go to them
[23:48] with cool models i can go to them with
[23:50] tons of data and they know what i'm
[23:52] saying they're interested they follow
[23:54] whereas if i'm going to say a usa team
[23:57] handball who is like three staff total
[24:00] right they don't have a data person they
[24:02] are just trying to make everything
[24:04] happen
[24:05] i'm not going to go to them with a whole
[24:06] model on how they should run things or
[24:08] who they should recruit who they should
[24:10] talent transfer that's not how i'm going
[24:12] to approach them we're going to go to
[24:14] them with more very simple data
[24:16] visualizations that they can just see
[24:18] the data in a picture nice little way
[24:21] that they can understand it and then
[24:23] they can look at it and be like oh yeah
[24:24] that dip is because blah blah blah and
[24:26] then they give me without as they're
[24:29] interpreting it they give me that
[24:31] knowledge that i was lacking that i
[24:33] didn't know what caused that dip because
[24:35] i didn't follow their sport super
[24:37] closely um so it's really about knowing
[24:39] your audience and knowing
[24:41] what you can bring them and what they
[24:43] can digest some ngbs i go to national
[24:46] governing bodies so like a usa track and
[24:47] field etc sorry um i can go to them and
[24:52] give them analytics some i know that
[24:55] they just really want a tool they can
[24:56] use so it's more about building like an
[24:58] r shiny app where they can accomplish
[25:01] something and so it's knowing what who
[25:03] your audience is what they need and what
[25:05] they're gonna actually react to and
[25:07] catch on to
[25:08] some
[25:09] might not even be at that step yet where
[25:11] you're just gonna start bringing them
[25:12] little bits of things as you go so that
[25:14] they can start to trust in it some are
[25:17] fully trusting you can bring a model to
[25:19] so it's really just knowing your
[25:20] audience and knowing how to approach
[25:22] them and then what to bring them
[25:25] that that's huge i was going to ask this
[25:27] and you already read my mind is that you
[25:29] know
[25:30] i always think about two like
[25:31] visualizations as a huge key tool and
[25:34] then also as you said i know a lot of
[25:36] people who work with scouts go to an app
[25:38] or an interface where it's about
[25:40] presenting data in a more clean way
[25:42] i'll open this to the group really quick
[25:44] are there any other tools or or
[25:46] different methods of communication that
[25:48] you guys are using
[25:49] i don't know what it might be if it's an
[25:51] interactive it's if it's something else
[25:52] that we haven't already talked about
[25:53] maybe there isn't i just thought i'd ask
[25:58] we're thinking um whenever i send
[26:00] something that has a lot of like stats
[26:02] abbreviations too i typically send like
[26:05] a glossary
[26:06] um with like an explanation an example
[26:09] so that if they have a question like i'm
[26:11] obviously happy to answer it but it's
[26:12] also like providing that
[26:14] uh those key takeaways and something
[26:17] that they might like it's obviously i'm
[26:19] used to it because i use it all the time
[26:21] but knowing that they're looking at like
[26:23] you know per like what's that like
[26:25] having like all of that kind of written
[26:28] out for them so that they can reference
[26:29] it and um it's almost like training them
[26:32] to learn the stats at the same time but
[26:35] um in a non-aggressive way
[26:38] we're hiding vegetables in their pasta
[26:40] is what we're doing
[26:42] so the next thing i was curious about
[26:44] and again i you know i think about
[26:45] people wanting to get into this field
[26:48] kelsey i'm going to go right back to you
[26:49] because of your story and how you came
[26:51] to your current position
[26:53] i think when we follow sport from the
[26:55] outside and we see
[26:57] sports data that is available publicly
[26:59] or how data is applied to sport publicly
[27:02] sometimes the perception is actually
[27:04] very different
[27:05] when you're on the inside
[27:07] and i'm certainly not asking you to give
[27:08] away any team secrets but what can you
[27:11] share about the realities of
[27:12] understanding
[27:14] what the public thinks sports analytics
[27:16] are even the data we think is real or
[27:18] not real from a sport perspective and
[27:20] maybe how that might feel
[27:22] look or be applied differently
[27:24] if you're working for an organization
[27:28] yeah i mean i think
[27:30] the perception of our jobs in general
[27:32] like being when i say i'm a basketball
[27:34] analyst people think one like i'm a tv
[27:37] person that's like and this player had
[27:40] like that's not what i do but um they
[27:42] also asked me like oh are you sitting on
[27:45] the you know court tracking like how
[27:47] many points
[27:48] this player had or and like that's
[27:50] totally not what it is either but i
[27:52] think people look at box scores and they
[27:53] think that i'm like
[27:55] doing the box force for some reason um
[27:58] but i think
[27:59] uh internally like we just have more
[28:01] access to different data that's not
[28:04] publicly available like player tracking
[28:05] data is a big one that um
[28:08] like i think at this point all 30 nba
[28:10] teams have it but i think it's just a
[28:12] lot more granular than people think
[28:15] usually so i would say that i mean a lot
[28:17] of it like if you go on to nba stats
[28:20] like there's a lot of stuff that i
[28:21] reference on there too just high level
[28:24] and
[28:25] but i think the player tracking data is
[28:26] really where
[28:27] probably the bigger difference comes in
[28:29] because we can really get granular with
[28:31] plays and pick and rolls and like really
[28:33] specific actions that um they track
[28:36] really well with player tracking data so
[28:38] i think it's like we just have access
[28:40] to more data i think that isn't
[28:43] necessarily publicly available that we
[28:45] use a lot um inside the organization
[28:49] sarah how do you see the difference
[28:50] between what the public thinks
[28:52] sports analytics may or may not be and
[28:55] what what you've seen inside a variety
[28:57] of sports over the years
[29:00] yeah it's funny we we sort of think our
[29:02] readers are pretty um
[29:05] you know well-informed uh
[29:08] sports fans and know a lot about
[29:11] the data but the data that um yeah that
[29:13] that we can we try to be really
[29:15] transparent about what we show um but
[29:17] there are some things that are just not
[29:18] not publicly available and there are
[29:20] some things we we do get access to which
[29:23] is great but we you know we'd love to be
[29:24] able to show the whole list of stuff but
[29:26] like that's not that's not that's not
[29:28] how it works that's not what the
[29:29] agreement says um so i feel like from
[29:31] from our perspective
[29:33] people tend to know what they're what
[29:35] you know we don't have to do a lot of
[29:36] explaining of you know what you know we
[29:38] don't have to explain on base percentage
[29:40] or stuff like that now we may have to
[29:42] explain like weighted on base percentage
[29:44] or some of the you know
[29:45] slightly more advanced things but that's
[29:47] a that's an interesting conversation too
[29:49] always to like figure out what how much
[29:52] information is like
[29:53] you know we don't want to be
[29:54] condescending we don't want to like
[29:56] over explain something but then we also
[29:58] want to be welcoming to people who don't
[30:00] understand the sport and and get people
[30:02] to understand sports analytics better um
[30:05] so that's always a weird kind of line to
[30:08] walk to where who is our audience and
[30:10] and what do they know and what what can
[30:12] we tell them what can we assume that
[30:14] they know already
[30:15] um it is i will say one thing there i
[30:18] have heard from an nba team that looks
[30:20] at our um
[30:21] or sorry an nba agent whose player looks
[30:25] at our raptor dashboard and has used
[30:27] that to try to negotiate a contract and
[30:30] i'm like that is amazing i love that
[30:34] that's that feels like a big win you
[30:36] know
[30:36] so it is funny that there are teams
[30:38] using it and looking at it or like
[30:40] looking at it and like maybe side eyeing
[30:41] it but like it
[30:43] to know that it's part of the
[30:44] conversation is is pretty cool i think
[30:47] jessica what's your perspective on on
[30:49] and particularly with you i mean some
[30:50] sports people may not even realize
[30:52] analytics are being applied
[30:54] yeah i feel like in my world it was
[30:58] the under the realization that the
[31:01] we don't have the data for a ton of
[31:03] things so
[31:04] coming from like working in the nba
[31:06] espn like you had all the data it was
[31:08] already clean most of the time like that
[31:11] was not what you were doing
[31:13] in my world it is there's so much web
[31:15] scraping data scraping we're trying to
[31:17] find bobsled skeleton results from china
[31:20] and japan and trying to pull those to
[31:22] compare with ours and like
[31:23] it's so much of the data scraping and
[31:26] cleaning world uh you would think coming
[31:28] to the us olympic and paralympic
[31:30] committee that you would have this great
[31:31] database and all of this data
[31:33] it's not the case at all just because
[31:36] the sports aren't like nba teams right
[31:38] you don't have these 30 teams and you
[31:39] have these x amount of players that
[31:41] you're tracking the whole time we are
[31:43] still trying to even define who we're
[31:45] tracking right so trying to figure out
[31:47] what juniors we should be tracking
[31:49] because we don't really track them until
[31:50] they get onto that international scene
[31:52] and then we only have data on the
[31:54] american athletes and so trying to
[31:55] compare that to around the world
[31:57] athletes we just don't have any data on
[31:59] them we pretty much just have results
[32:01] data for most of the rest of the world
[32:04] um
[32:05] sometimes we don't even have that great
[32:07] for some sports right for swimming for a
[32:09] track and field you can pretty you can
[32:11] get results data pretty well but for
[32:12] some of the lesser known sports and from
[32:15] the paralympic side getting the data and
[32:18] gathering the data is a huge task and
[32:20] not an easy one um so i think people
[32:22] think it's just you know doing all the
[32:24] analysis and making these cool
[32:25] dashboards and visualizations but from
[32:28] my world it's a lot of trying to find
[32:30] accurate reliable data scraping it
[32:33] cleaning it figuring out how we can
[32:34] compare it with all of the other data
[32:36] and combine it across the player
[32:38] tracking data across our financial data
[32:41] all the different aspects
[32:42] to try and pull it all into one place is
[32:44] a huge portion of my
[32:46] daily life
[32:48] and let's pull back the curtain on that
[32:50] a little bit because many analysts i
[32:52] speak to particularly as data does get
[32:54] more and more advanced in sport uh
[32:56] tracking data is like the holy grail for
[32:58] us in the nhl we're hopeful we get that
[32:59] fully soon someday but
[33:02] the realities are at least
[33:04] some people i've talked to this is not
[33:06] building happy models and doing amazing
[33:08] things and coming up with revelations
[33:10] every day there's there's some real
[33:12] grunt work involved in jessica you just
[33:14] outlined some of it kelsey what
[33:16] share the ugly truth the realities of
[33:19] being in this world that you're in
[33:22] yeah it's definitely not all like
[33:24] intense modeling and finding these like
[33:27] new
[33:28] ways to do things a lot of it's like you
[33:30] get a call from somebody and it's like
[33:33] something pretty
[33:34] unintelligent sometimes like it just
[33:38] takes a while uh like some of the asks
[33:40] you get
[33:41] aren't aren't like oh let me think
[33:43] statistically how i would do this a lot
[33:45] of it's like i really want a page that
[33:47] has
[33:48] these players ranked this way and you're
[33:51] like all right and then it's just kind
[33:53] of like a
[33:55] pretty like easy task sometimes um i
[33:58] think there are longer term projects
[34:00] that obviously require a lot more stats
[34:02] stuff like any of the modeling draft
[34:04] modeling
[34:05] like there's so much that goes into
[34:08] in general like a lot of the models for
[34:10] you know projecting players and um but a
[34:12] lot but a lot of the time too like
[34:14] during the year there's just a lot of
[34:16] like
[34:16] random questions that come up um that
[34:20] aren't necessarily like
[34:22] super involved it's just oh here's what
[34:26] you asked for and sometimes it takes
[34:28] like an hour to put together sometimes
[34:29] more sometimes less but yeah a lot of it
[34:32] and i think no matter how much data you
[34:35] have too like there are still days where
[34:37] i'm web scraping things because well one
[34:39] that's like my favorite thing to do it's
[34:41] like my hobby um just in general like
[34:44] i'm obsessed with love scraping like i
[34:46] just find stuff online i'm like maybe
[34:48] i'll pull it into a database for myself
[34:50] like i'm obsessed like that was one of
[34:52] my hobbies in grad school too like i
[34:54] would just find things and webscrape
[34:55] them so i never get away from that
[34:58] because i think there's always things
[35:00] that they don't have an api or like
[35:02] whether it's legal or not um
[35:05] so they might blacklist me i'm not sure
[35:08] um but i think there's a lot of that too
[35:10] like a specific way that you want it and
[35:12] you're like oh this site has it let me
[35:13] just scrape the columns and
[35:15] plop it in there so yeah it's not always
[35:17] like the most intelligent math thing
[35:20] i've ever done sometimes it's just
[35:21] getting it done you know
[35:23] and sarah i don't know if you've seen
[35:25] this but you know i've seen some
[35:27] organizations sometimes the just the
[35:28] data management itself is so
[35:32] big
[35:33] that if that is your passion
[35:35] there might be a role just to do that
[35:36] maybe you aren't doing
[35:39] the hardcore analysis and that's amazing
[35:41] it's so valuable are there other
[35:43] interesting roles that maybe you've seen
[35:45] because you've looked across all these
[35:46] sports where
[35:48] the perception of what this work can be
[35:50] is is maybe different than what maybe
[35:51] some of our attendees think
[35:54] absolutely we're actually 538 is
[35:56] currently hiring for a for a data a data
[35:58] editor someone who's just really going
[36:01] to
[36:01] um manage our
[36:04] particularly our polls database um
[36:05] because obviously we do we do politics
[36:07] too i don't know if you guys know that
[36:09] um
[36:10] but yeah and um another job that we have
[36:12] at 538 that i think is super cool is um
[36:15] is a quantitative editor and it's
[36:17] someone who just
[36:19] like edits people's data so okay you've
[36:22] run you've run some code and r and our
[36:24] quant editor is going to to go through
[36:26] it line by line and check it and i love
[36:28] that
[36:29] yeah i think it's so it's like
[36:31] super i think it's really helpful some
[36:33] people are a little annoyed that they
[36:35] you know that their their work is being
[36:36] checked or whatever but most people are
[36:38] like oh my god that's amazing to have
[36:40] that kind of support to make sure that
[36:42] that you're you know what you're what
[36:44] you're trying to say is correct and is
[36:46] it was gathered the right way and was
[36:48] analyzed the right way which i think is
[36:50] awesome but i think i think more
[36:51] newspapers should have it but i think
[36:52] just more more places should have that
[36:55] kind of that kind of support staff or
[36:57] that kind of so that's a very a very
[36:59] cool kind of thing too that's out there
[37:00] as well
[37:02] yeah to that end jessica with you know
[37:04] we talk about cleaning scraping building
[37:06] an app doing whatever it is maybe it's a
[37:08] search maybe it's a query it's rerunning
[37:10] a report
[37:11] are there
[37:12] roles or skills that maybe you wish you
[37:16] had or had had when you came in or is
[37:18] there if and again a budget was no
[37:20] question right of course
[37:22] are there other staff roles that you
[37:24] think could be really valuable when
[37:26] people are thinking about this is a
[37:27] career in sport analytics that i might
[37:28] pursue
[37:30] yeah i wish i had more understanding of
[37:32] like the back end so kind of more of the
[37:35] it world and the back end of the
[37:37] databases just so that i
[37:39] we have that's another really cool and
[37:41] interesting job to me is we have our it
[37:43] database architects and they're the ones
[37:45] that we're working constantly with to be
[37:47] like hey i built a new web scraper i
[37:50] need it to
[37:51] run every monday at 4am and
[37:54] input into this database so i can access
[37:56] it for these reports etc but i wish i
[37:58] definitely
[38:00] had a better understanding of what they
[38:01] do and how they do it so that i could
[38:03] talk to them about it more intelligently
[38:06] sometimes i'm like they're speaking a
[38:07] whole different world than me right now
[38:09] and i don't know what they're quite
[38:10] saying but we're just going to keep
[38:12] going and hopefully we get to the right
[38:13] place
[38:14] um so i do wish that i had more of i
[38:17] knew sql and had kind of a base
[38:19] understanding but just the actual like
[38:21] architect and how one's built in the
[38:23] whole like we have a stage environment
[38:25] dev environment your stage environment
[38:27] your production environment just kind of
[38:28] understanding that whole world at a
[38:30] baseline when i came in i feel like i've
[38:33] gathered it as i went along but there
[38:36] was a lot of stumbles along the way so i
[38:38] wish that i had a better understanding
[38:40] of that and i think that's also
[38:42] a job that's needed at least in our
[38:44] world a lot more of um rit dev guys are
[38:47] constantly backloaded because
[38:49] it's not just my team coming to them
[38:51] with 800 different requests daily but
[38:53] every team in the org is and
[38:56] that's just we need more of them and
[38:58] because it needs to be done right right
[39:00] if you don't
[39:01] set up your database right if they don't
[39:03] all talk to each other in our world we
[39:05] have hundreds of different databases and
[39:08] a whole system to make them talk to each
[39:09] other but if one thing isn't done right
[39:11] and somebody goes rogue and doesn't set
[39:13] it up then all of a sudden everything
[39:15] breaks and that database is completely
[39:17] siloed
[39:18] and then they want reports that connect
[39:20] it and you're like well
[39:22] you didn't quite set up the database
[39:23] right it doesn't talk to everything else
[39:25] so and when you have
[39:27] not just like 40 or even hundreds of
[39:30] athletes you have billions of athletes
[39:31] in the database trying to connect you
[39:33] can't connect on name because
[39:35] i mean for the tokyo we had two people
[39:37] in the delegation of like 1500 people
[39:39] with the exact same name you can't do it
[39:42] on name and email address because half
[39:43] the time it's mistyped by the person
[39:45] putting it in and just different things
[39:47] like that so trying to connect if it's
[39:48] not done properly is
[39:50] a tough time so that's one skill set i
[39:52] wish and one
[39:53] job that i think is going to like more
[39:55] and more people hiring for in the future
[39:58] because
[39:59] we want more and more data
[40:00] uh but we need the people to help on the
[40:02] back end
[40:03] facebook might agree just throwing that
[40:05] out there just kidding kelsey how about
[40:07] you skills or roles that you think are
[40:10] are needed you wish you had or that
[40:12] you'd like to see evolve in the in the
[40:13] sport analytics space
[40:16] yeah i mean i was lucky in the sense
[40:19] that i came in with data engineering
[40:20] experience but i think to her point like
[40:23] it is a pretty big thing and when i was
[40:24] hired initially it was my job was like a
[40:27] 50 50 split of data engineering and um
[40:30] statistics so
[40:32] i think that
[40:33] is really going to be really important
[40:35] and i i also would say
[40:37] um software engineering for anybody on
[40:39] this call who is interested in that
[40:42] um that is becoming huge right now like
[40:45] i know like almost every team is right
[40:46] now is hiring some type of developer
[40:48] like full stack or some type of software
[40:50] engineer because i think the push to
[40:52] have everything on like sustainable
[40:54] websites is becoming a big thing and i'm
[40:57] not like i know are shiny like for you
[41:00] know simple apps but i'm not a like
[41:02] developer by any means and i think that
[41:04] that's something that is going to be
[41:06] such a big push going forward so i'd say
[41:09] like if you're interested in any of that
[41:12] like
[41:13] everybody's hiring a developer like
[41:15] almost every team recently has been
[41:16] hiring uh oh in the nba and then it'll
[41:18] be in general as high always hiring
[41:21] developers but um i think that's going
[41:23] to be such an important skill so it's
[41:24] like the front end website development
[41:27] using the stuff that the analytic
[41:29] analytics people are building like
[41:30] models and reports and put being able to
[41:32] put those online as kind of like a
[41:34] self-service um portal i think that's
[41:37] going to be huge moving forward i wish i
[41:38] knew more front-end stuff so i could
[41:40] kind of like help people i only know
[41:42] what i know at this point um and it's
[41:44] too much to know data engineering stats
[41:46] and all the front ends like you gotta
[41:48] draw the line in his hand somewhere but
[41:50] i would say like that is such a huge
[41:52] opportunity and and now that hein says
[41:54] 2020 i'm like maybe i should have
[41:56] done more web development stuff because
[41:58] they're also making the money so
[42:00] good
[42:04] and sarah that leads right to the
[42:06] question i wanted to ask you as well i
[42:08] think when people think about working in
[42:10] sport analytics the exciting stuff the
[42:12] pop is the new discovery or the new
[42:15] model and that certainly is invigorating
[42:17] and tremendous work and important work
[42:20] but are there trends that maybe you are
[42:22] seeing whether it be in one sport and
[42:24] that's inspiring other sports or trends
[42:26] across sport
[42:28] in terms of analytics are there you know
[42:30] we just heard about you know developers
[42:32] are becoming a thing web-based
[42:34] presentation is becoming a thing is
[42:36] there a different way people are looking
[42:38] at data are there different types of
[42:40] questions is is tracking data unlocking
[42:43] some doors what kind of things are you
[42:44] seeing outside of the go research this
[42:46] question and find the answer that may or
[42:48] may not be happening in sport analytics
[42:49] right now
[42:51] yeah there's some there's some really
[42:53] exciting things happening in
[42:55] in a lot of sports where we haven't
[42:57] always had great data you know soccer is
[43:00] this like
[43:01] there's so much um so much we don't know
[43:03] about soccer because they're so
[43:05] the things that are measured are so
[43:07] specific and so off ball stuff
[43:10] player tracking is just like it's the
[43:12] it's the it's the coolest thing it's
[43:15] gonna be amazing what what happens what
[43:17] keeps happening in in all these sports
[43:20] but there's some really really exciting
[43:22] different there's a lot of there's
[43:23] there's space for people to work in
[43:26] these because we don't have because we
[43:28] haven't traditionally had the data you
[43:30] know baseball is a is a sport where it
[43:32] feels like
[43:34] there's not a lot new to
[43:37] to learn because people have been
[43:39] digging so deeply for so long like you
[43:41] know i made a joke about nfl defense
[43:43] before but like we don't know anything
[43:45] about nfl defense like we know so little
[43:47] and and that's that that is frustrating
[43:50] as someone who wants to like dig into it
[43:52] it's also really exciting to see what
[43:54] people are gonna see
[43:56] as we get you know as the next gen stat
[43:58] stuff becomes more available and that
[43:59] kind of thing so i think those those
[44:01] sports where we haven't done as much are
[44:04] really exciting i'm i'm really excited
[44:06] for olympic sport to dig more into
[44:08] olympic sports because again it's it's
[44:10] untapped like you're not going to find
[44:12] people who are going to find new
[44:14] new things about baseball you are going
[44:16] to find people who are going to find new
[44:17] ways to look at and to optimize
[44:20] performance and and you know metal
[44:21] counts which is what we care about the
[44:23] olympics right um for all these other
[44:25] sports i think that is exciting i mean
[44:28] we saw that a little bit
[44:29] with gymnastics this summer like there
[44:32] maybe wasn't the kind of team
[44:34] optimization that that there was
[44:36] criticism of the team optimization and i
[44:38] think thinking about that more
[44:40] analytically is gonna help build a
[44:42] better team particularly when we don't
[44:44] like have simone biles to build the team
[44:46] around we're gonna have to be gonna have
[44:48] to be smarter um and so i i'm really
[44:50] excited about the gymnastics stuff too i
[44:52] think or the olympics in general i think
[44:53] that's gonna be this great like world of
[44:56] of new discoveries that just because we
[44:58] haven't
[45:01] doped into that so far you know
[45:03] well jessica that tease you up my friend
[45:05] any trends or new innovation that you
[45:07] see coming across sports from an
[45:09] analytic perspective
[45:12] i mean
[45:13] exactly what sarah was just saying like
[45:15] so much is untapped in our entire world
[45:18] uh you've got
[45:20] the handful of sports that have started
[45:22] to use and have databases and have
[45:25] started to use analytics
[45:27] and the majority of them don't even have
[45:29] a database yet right so trying to work
[45:31] with them to set up the basics set up
[45:33] databases like i feel like more and more
[45:36] people are understanding that they need
[45:37] data that they can utilize it it could
[45:39] really help them but they're like i
[45:41] where do i start how do i don't even
[45:43] know what i'm doing
[45:44] so starting with those
[45:46] teams and everything of this is how
[45:48] you're going to set up a database like
[45:50] what are you wanting to track what do
[45:51] you think is important in your sport
[45:53] how can we start tracking that how can
[45:55] we get it into this database then we can
[45:56] help you analyze it and things like that
[45:58] but just even i'm gonna be honest for
[46:01] most olympic sports it we're still at
[46:02] stage one like we are still getting them
[46:05] to ask the right questions figure out
[46:07] what data they need and want and think
[46:09] would be important and then getting them
[46:11] to collect it that's the level we're at
[46:13] with the majority of the sports but i
[46:15] think that's an exciting time because
[46:17] there's just so much to do and so much
[46:20] unknown and so many findings that can be
[46:22] had and even in the sports like i said i
[46:24] was a swimmer the sports that's a sport
[46:26] that has pretty good data pretty good
[46:28] analytics they have a staff
[46:30] you talk about tokyo and optimizing um
[46:33] gymnastics
[46:35] that mixed medley relay really needed
[46:37] some data behind it um that was a missed
[46:40] metal that very much i was at that i was
[46:43] at the pool for that event and there
[46:45] were whisperings of what the relay was
[46:47] um on deck and i was like wait that's
[46:49] the relay and they were like yeah and i
[46:51] was like okay that's not winnable like
[46:54] we lose by five seconds easy like but
[46:56] that specific setup when you look at the
[46:58] data it's not winnable females versus
[47:01] males and breaststroke and fly is just a
[47:02] bigger difference and when i saw we went
[47:05] male female female male
[47:07] i was just like nope
[47:08] we're done like it's not caleb caleb is
[47:11] caleb dressle but he cannot overcome
[47:13] a 9 10 second gap like that's just not
[47:16] humanly possible so even in the sports
[47:19] where they do have some analytics going
[47:21] there's still so much more that can be
[47:22] done to help them so i don't know i'm
[47:25] just so excited about all the
[47:26] possibilities and just getting it
[47:27] started for them for a ton of sports
[47:30] especially as teams start to buy in
[47:33] we've started to really gain the trust
[47:34] of most ngbs and sports and i think that
[47:37] was really step one and now we're on
[47:38] step two of how can we help let's start
[47:41] let's start this whole process
[47:44] awesome we have just a few minutes left
[47:46] so i want to i have one quick fire
[47:48] question for everyone that came from one
[47:49] of our attendees and then we'll wrap
[47:51] with one question to everyone kelsey
[47:53] we'll start with you to answer this
[47:54] question
[47:55] what coding languages and other data
[47:58] programs do you typically use in a
[48:00] standard day
[48:03] yes i for me the
[48:05] the big three are are python and sequel
[48:08] i'm in those almost every day um and i
[48:10] would say depending on what the team you
[48:12] join
[48:13] and depending on what their team was
[48:15] built in like some teams are really
[48:17] python focused and some teams are really
[48:19] are focused
[48:20] but i think it's always helpful to know
[48:22] both in that case like i think python's
[48:24] way better the part of my job that is uh
[48:27] data engineering python's the way to go
[48:29] and i also enjoy web scraping in python
[48:32] more than r i hit enjoy
[48:35] but i think those three things are for
[48:37] the data science well the three i use
[48:39] the most
[48:41] jessica how about you
[48:43] yep completely second what kelsey said
[48:45] depending on your organization r versus
[48:47] python or both
[48:49] i use r usopc is very r focused but
[48:52] there are definitely instances where i'm
[48:54] like we should definitely be doing this
[48:55] in python
[48:57] web scraping things like that where
[48:58] python just does better at it but we've
[49:01] set everything up to really only handle
[49:03] our codes as far as the back end stuff
[49:05] so we make do with selenium and r and
[49:07] things like that
[49:09] and then the other big one for us is
[49:10] tableau so data visualization in tableau
[49:13] or power bi for some organizations but
[49:16] we're tableau
[49:17] only
[49:19] sarah what are you seeing on a
[49:20] day-to-day basis as they must know
[49:22] technologies and must use
[49:25] we we do most of our work as an r um
[49:29] honestly what for me personally i'm i'm
[49:31] checking things more in it you know in
[49:33] excel or google sheets um but we do
[49:36] mostly in our there's a little python um
[49:39] nate works in stata
[49:40] don't tell anyone um
[49:43] no one heard no one heard yeah that's
[49:45] like that old oldest oldest of old
[49:47] schools but yeah i mean r is is
[49:49] definitely what we're what we're mostly
[49:50] using
[49:51] well that's because ours the best okay
[49:53] not that i'm biased anyway
[49:55] well we'll wrap with this you all have
[49:57] just been so informative and so
[49:59] inspiring to think about the work that's
[50:01] being done we would be remiss it's
[50:03] cliche but it's true
[50:05] for our attendees if someone is
[50:07] listening or watching and wants to find
[50:10] a way to break into analytical work in
[50:14] sport
[50:15] what advice would you have for them and
[50:17] sarah i'll go right back to you what
[50:18] would you share with an aspiring
[50:21] data analyst of some kind of any role in
[50:23] sport today
[50:25] well i'll repeat my advice to to to to
[50:28] learn some communications don't don't
[50:30] just don't slap that off really really
[50:32] do that a great way to get yourself you
[50:35] know one one thing that people will say
[50:37] is we'll publish something publish some
[50:39] you know some some finding some work
[50:41] that you've done a great way to do that
[50:42] is to write about it and write about it
[50:44] for your school newspaper then you have
[50:46] something to point to a a you know a url
[50:49] to send people um that will help you no
[50:52] matter what but yeah i would say just
[50:54] you know apply to things as
[50:56] apply to many internships go out there
[50:59] and put yourself out there and
[51:01] there are lots of opportunities right
[51:02] now uh so it's a good time to to get out
[51:05] there and really and really find
[51:06] something that you're passionate about
[51:09] kelsey i'm excited to hear your advice
[51:11] particularly because you highlighted
[51:12] that you didn't go the networking route
[51:14] you just straight out started applying
[51:16] what would you say to someone who came
[51:17] to you and said i want to break into
[51:18] this field
[51:20] yeah i would say if you're if the job is
[51:22] coding heavy putting stuff on your
[51:24] github that you can link to your resume
[51:25] when you apply um so people can see your
[51:28] technical skills and then i would just
[51:29] go on teamwork online and just go ham
[51:32] like apply to everything that you think
[51:33] would be good because you never know
[51:35] who's who someone's going to resonate
[51:38] with your resume
[51:39] and then i have sort of a weird like
[51:42] uh interviewing tip too that might
[51:45] people not might advise uh on as well
[51:47] but i think there's like this pressure
[51:49] to be like really buttoned up and say
[51:52] all the right things and be like really
[51:55] formal but i would say like
[51:57] in my experience a lot of the times
[51:59] where i've gotten
[52:00] an internship or a job is when they feel
[52:02] like they can really connect you as a
[52:03] person
[52:04] so
[52:05] i'm bad because i like to crack jokes
[52:07] all the time and that's just like who i
[52:09] am but i think if they know that that's
[52:11] really who you are and that's what
[52:13] they're getting and they like you as a
[52:14] person it helps a lot too like obviously
[52:16] you have to have the technical skills
[52:18] and be able to do the job but i think
[52:20] when you really connect with people on
[52:22] like
[52:23] a personal level to some degree when
[52:25] you're interviewing it does help at
[52:26] least in my experience like they know
[52:28] what they're getting from your
[52:29] personality and if they would like to
[52:31] work with you i think is a big thing too
[52:34] i love that
[52:35] jessica your advice to the burgeoning
[52:38] sport analytical professional
[52:41] find your passion and don't give up on
[52:43] it so like
[52:44] like the others have said like keep
[52:45] applying i mean teamwork online and
[52:48] going ham was exactly kind of my thought
[52:49] i
[52:50] every single morning would wake up and
[52:52] just apply to every single new one that
[52:54] came up and that's what i did for
[52:57] months right in college because all it
[52:59] takes is that first one you get the
[53:01] first one and i promise your foot is in
[53:04] the door like i know that's cliche but
[53:06] it really does help because then you
[53:07] know people in that world
[53:09] similar uh to kelsey i did not do great
[53:12] at networking that was not ever my forte
[53:14] it was i'm gonna do good work and i'm
[53:16] gonna let that speak for me um and so as
[53:19] soon as i got the first one with the
[53:20] hornets then
[53:22] zepp and his whole team knew other
[53:24] people in the organizations around nba
[53:27] and even other sports that could really
[53:28] help me when i needed it but just don't
[53:31] give up and don't get
[53:33] dis like um
[53:34] not disappointed i forget what the word
[53:36] i'm trying to go for is but
[53:38] don't get
[53:40] upset if you're not even getting emails
[53:42] back i'd say i applied to thousands
[53:45] probably got
[53:46] 10 to 15 interviews out of those
[53:49] thousands right and most of them you
[53:51] will never even hear from
[53:52] so don't don't get just yeah just keep
[53:56] working at it don't give up
[53:59] no that's great before we wrap is there
[54:01] anything that i haven't asked that is
[54:03] front of mind or so important that you
[54:05] would like to share with our audience
[54:06] any of you feel free to speak up if you
[54:08] have any final points
[54:12] you don't have to
[54:16] this is obviously an exciting you know
[54:18] this is an exciting time and and um if
[54:20] you're passionate about sports there's a
[54:22] place for you in in the world of sports
[54:24] you can you can get there um it might be
[54:27] the process might seem hard or it's just
[54:30] discouraging or whatever but you can get
[54:31] there you know you can
[54:34] i think there's a
[54:36] conception of like i only want to work
[54:38] in basketball or or i only want to work
[54:40] in
[54:41] football but if you can get your foot in
[54:42] the door to a different sport to start
[54:45] off like with an internship is how i
[54:47] started and i was lucky enough to do nba
[54:50] but i would say like be open and like
[54:52] i've known people who started in
[54:54] baseball and then moved to basketball
[54:56] and vice versa like i think
[54:59] if you have like some sports focused job
[55:02] or internship even if it's a different
[55:03] sport it'll still help you so i would
[55:05] say be open with that as well
[55:08] and don't be afraid to like do smaller
[55:10] ones so don't be afraid to go do a small
[55:13] um g league team or anything like that
[55:15] or even i worked at my college in sports
[55:18] and you know what i started off as
[55:20] literally being the person that did the
[55:22] box scores at the table while basketball
[55:24] games went on because that was the way i
[55:26] could get my foot in the door and so
[55:28] don't be afraid take any opportunity you
[55:30] can get to get that experience even if
[55:32] it might not be the exact type position
[55:34] that you're hoping to go into it all it
[55:36] all matters
