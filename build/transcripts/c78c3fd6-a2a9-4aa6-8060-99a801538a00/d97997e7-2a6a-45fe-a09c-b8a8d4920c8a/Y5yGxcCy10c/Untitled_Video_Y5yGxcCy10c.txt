[00:00] good morning everyone i'm jun yang a
[00:03] professor of statistics at uconn
[00:06] on behalf of the organizing committee
[00:08] i'd like to extend the warmest welcome
[00:11] to all of you to the 2020 yukon
[00:14] sports analytics symposium uc says
[00:17] hosted at uconn a world renowned school
[00:21] for college sports
[00:23] there are many sports analytics
[00:24] conferences why this one
[00:27] our distinctive feature is the focus on
[00:30] students
[00:31] the future workforce of sports analytics
[00:34] our conference is designed to be
[00:37] accessible in terms of technical level
[00:40] cost and space to students and all our
[00:44] missions are to showcase sports
[00:46] analytics for students at an accessible
[00:49] level train students in data analytics
[00:52] with application to sports data and
[00:55] foster collaboration between academic
[00:57] programs and the sports industry
[01:00] being virtual this year gives more power
[01:03] to our conference
[01:04] as of this moment we have
[01:06] over 300 registrants which is about
[01:09] three times of the size last year we
[01:12] have a packed program ahead
[01:14] four special guests will give welcoming
[01:17] remarks the first one is dr carl
[01:20] leachway provost and executive vice
[01:23] president for academic affairs
[01:26] university of connecticut
[01:28] please join me in welcoming dr lijway
[01:35] carl
[01:40] okay great thank you uh so welcome
[01:43] virtually to uconn a top 25 public
[01:46] university that excels in the student
[01:48] experience
[01:50] research to drive discovery and further
[01:53] expand that student experience and a
[01:54] world-class sports program that draws
[01:57] students to uconn
[01:58] keeps our alumni connected and supports
[02:01] the state of connecticut in so many
[02:03] important ways i want to say
[02:05] congratulations to the statistical data
[02:07] science lab at uconn and dr yan for
[02:10] pulling together
[02:11] the 2020 yukon sports analytic
[02:14] conference
[02:15] as he mentioned there are some some
[02:16] really unique and special aspects about
[02:19] this conference uh particularly
[02:21] and this also connects with what i had
[02:23] said about you know the mission and
[02:25] vision of our university is the way in
[02:27] which the conference is unique in its
[02:29] focus on students and this includes
[02:32] excellent posters and and making the
[02:34] conference accessible to students
[02:37] uconn has you know a really terrific
[02:40] statistics team that provides a base for
[02:43] for us
[02:44] kind of supporting and holding this and
[02:47] and as dr yan mentioned it's a great
[02:50] sports school and so it's a great place
[02:52] to host this sort of event
[02:54] i'll just say personally i i have a
[02:56] connection to this world i
[02:59] for a early part of my career have been
[03:01] a consultant a college basketball teams
[03:04] and and thinking about the interplay of
[03:07] analytics but with mental health
[03:10] and i just want to give you a quick
[03:11] example
[03:12] there was one team i was working with
[03:14] and a
[03:15] center who analytics easily told us that
[03:19] in practice
[03:20] he shot about 80 percent in his free
[03:22] throws and in games he shot under 50
[03:25] analytics also could tell us
[03:27] that he almost always missed the first
[03:30] free throw and almost always made the
[03:32] second one but
[03:33] what it couldn't tell us on its own is
[03:35] is the way it is kind of the why
[03:38] and and what is maybe the unique aspect
[03:40] of that individual and it turned out in
[03:42] this case
[03:43] this was someone who went when he would
[03:47] get uh
[03:48] uh kind of out of breath from from
[03:51] physical exertion would get anxious
[03:54] and that anxiety made it really
[03:56] difficult for him to shoot his free
[03:58] throws so
[03:59] by the second free throw he had calmed
[04:01] down and it was much more like the way
[04:03] he had practiced and so it was
[04:05] interesting because what we tried to do
[04:06] at first
[04:07] was to say okay let's figure out how to
[04:10] make him less anxious or to figure out
[04:13] uh you know what are the ways in which
[04:15] you know we can calm them down and
[04:17] simply we couldn't figure it out it just
[04:19] nothing was working
[04:21] so then we thought okay let's simulate
[04:24] the anxiety experience in practice so
[04:27] we'd have him breathe into a paper bag
[04:30] create
[04:31] that kind of hyperventilation and then
[04:33] that anxiety and have him practice
[04:36] in the anxiety state
[04:38] and you know i'll just say and of course
[04:39] i'm cherry picking but um one of the
[04:42] very last games of the season and a
[04:43] victory over duke he shot 16 for 21 from
[04:46] the free throw line and
[04:48] paid almost all of his first free throws
[04:50] so
[04:51] mental health is something that's
[04:53] important to me i'm a professor in
[04:55] psychological sciences and and i know
[04:58] data analytics is an incredibly powerful
[05:00] tool and and i hope
[05:02] that throughout the day
[05:04] we can just think about you know kind of
[05:06] our student athletes as as people and
[05:09] and the kind of mental health aspect
[05:11] but separately this
[05:13] is really a great event i'm thrilled we
[05:15] have it here at uconn and i love when
[05:18] when we have the opportunity to really
[05:20] take several areas of strengths in this
[05:23] case what uconn can do in terms of
[05:26] statistical analyses and understanding
[05:29] data what uconn can do in terms of
[05:32] bringing great partners and creating
[05:33] collaborations and what yukon means in
[05:36] terms of a great sports university
[05:38] so thank you for letting me talk for a
[05:40] few minutes and and i hope everyone has
[05:42] a great conference today
[05:45] thank you carl
[05:46] next we have anthony grazo football
[05:49] assistant strength and conditioning
[05:51] coach university of our connecticut
[05:54] let's welcome anthony
[05:56] how you doing everybody thank you doc i
[05:57] really appreciate that and i'm honored
[05:59] to be able to be here and represent
[06:01] athletics i quickly just want to shout
[06:03] out the two statistics interns that have
[06:05] actually helped me with a lot of the
[06:06] catapult and gps data georgia
[06:08] casparowicz and spencer tibbling uh
[06:10] georgia actually submitted one of her
[06:11] posters today so uh it should be pretty
[06:13] interesting to see what what she's been
[06:14] able to present and obviously come up
[06:16] with uh and just to just to actually
[06:18] build off what carl was talking about
[06:19] it's a very interesting topic where
[06:21] you're you're essentially taking a look
[06:23] at and my vision of what sports science
[06:25] is is where
[06:26] science in general takes a look at what
[06:28] is right what is happening what are what
[06:31] are the truths behind what is happening
[06:33] and obviously you guys are able to
[06:34] gather some form of data that would
[06:36] allow you to take some information in
[06:38] about this particular basketball player
[06:39] carl and you can say to yourself well
[06:41] you were looking for the why right and
[06:43] that's kind of where i see sport data
[06:45] and analytics going even not even just
[06:47] in the sports science sense but just in
[06:49] general we want to take a look at what
[06:50] is
[06:51] and now we need to come up with and use
[06:53] our brains to come up with what ought to
[06:55] be and what are some of the robust
[06:56] protocols and some of the some of the
[06:58] some of the ways that we can actually
[06:59] create planning and preparation for
[07:01] these athletes to better
[07:02] sort of combat some of the issues that
[07:04] they may take in during that particular
[07:06] point in time so you guys obviously
[07:07] decided at that particular point in time
[07:09] let's try and duplicate or simulate this
[07:11] this particular point of anxiety that he
[07:13] feels and let's just make sure that he
[07:15] understands what he is going to face
[07:16] when he gets into those particular
[07:17] positions to be honest with you carl
[07:19] that right there coming from yourself
[07:21] who's obviously a provost at this
[07:23] university i can i can firmly say that
[07:26] that
[07:27] thought process is farther along than
[07:30] many of the thought processes that i
[07:31] experience on a daily basis in the world
[07:33] of sport performance right from sport
[07:35] coaches from
[07:36] whether sport coaches train coaches
[07:38] athletic trainers whatever the case may
[07:40] be right trying to figure out a way to
[07:42] bridge the gap and really take a look at
[07:43] truths and ways that we can look at the
[07:44] game demands and actually understand
[07:46] what the game asks of these players
[07:49] then coming up with some of the plans
[07:51] that we need to do to actually make
[07:52] sensible decisions right so that's kind
[07:54] of my vision for sports science and doc
[07:55] wanted me to kind of talk about where i
[07:57] see sports science going at uconn well
[07:59] what i really tried to push forward and
[08:01] i'm in the process of pushing forward
[08:02] now is creating sort of a service
[08:04] platform for basically all of the teams
[08:07] that are that are prevalent at uconn so
[08:10] taking a look at whether it be men's
[08:11] soccer women's soccer basketball hockey
[08:13] football whatever
[08:14] being able to provide them with
[08:16] obviously they have a sport coach they
[08:17] have athletic trainers they have a
[08:19] sports nutritionist they have
[08:21] a team psychologist obviously they have
[08:23] you know
[08:24] a group of individuals but adding to
[08:26] that a sports scientist that would be
[08:28] sort of allotted to that particular
[08:29] point in time particular team to make
[08:32] sure that they had some sort of bridging
[08:34] at the gap right bringing the lab to the
[08:36] field bringing the field to the lab and
[08:37] what this does is it would give
[08:38] everybody a chance to obviously
[08:40] collaborate because the training process
[08:42] requires immense collaboration so
[08:44] giving someone who may be interested in
[08:46] sports science and spends a lot of time
[08:47] down in the lab an opportunity to speak
[08:49] to a sport coach or a strength coach and
[08:51] giving them a little bit more feedback
[08:52] on how they can actually work together
[08:54] and create some sort of universal
[08:55] language amongst all of the people at
[08:57] uconn now
[08:59] with any vision obviously there are
[09:00] going to be obstacles right and i i
[09:02] would be remiss to not point out the the
[09:04] massive obstacles that are going to be
[09:05] coming your way when we try to talk
[09:07] about putting forth data and analytics
[09:09] and actually getting it to a point where
[09:10] people are listening and taking a look
[09:12] at the actual facts of you know in my
[09:14] specific right my work in the physical
[09:16] sense right so we're taking a look at
[09:18] the specific game demands as far as how
[09:20] much ground do these guys cover right
[09:22] what are the sport movements that they
[09:23] perform the competition movements uh how
[09:26] fast they perform them what are the
[09:27] distances they perform them at uh and
[09:29] obviously the speeds and the different
[09:30] intensities some of them perform in a
[09:32] high intensity fashion some movements
[09:34] are performed at a certain amount of
[09:35] time in low intensity fashions are these
[09:37] time motion analysis have to be used to
[09:39] really try to gather these truths but
[09:40] the obstacles are obviously going to be
[09:42] coming into play when you talk about
[09:43] having an underdeveloped sports
[09:45] structure here in america and maybe
[09:47] another place as well but i can speak
[09:49] specifically to that fractured support
[09:52] structure and that's fractured sports
[09:53] society that we have where in any other
[09:56] profession you're going to have
[09:58] individuals who have all kind of reached
[10:00] a standard of excellence prior to
[10:01] diverging in their separate pathways
[10:03] here we do not really
[10:05] that's not really the case in score
[10:06] performance right you can kind of just
[10:08] become a coach and you can be you can
[10:09] work your way towards athletic training
[10:10] but
[10:11] in my opinion and what i really truly
[10:14] believe is that it is not enough to
[10:15] simply just be interested in your
[10:17] particular realm and and no one is free
[10:19] of this criticism there there are
[10:20] strength coaches out there athletic
[10:22] trainers sport coaches sports scientists
[10:24] who
[10:25] even in their interest in that
[10:27] particular field are not doing what is
[10:29] truly sensible for the athlete and so no
[10:32] one is free of that criticism but it is
[10:33] not enough to even just be interested in
[10:35] your particular realm you need to be
[10:37] interested in the holistic approach as
[10:38] to how every single one of those
[10:40] elements affects every single other one
[10:42] of those elements and ultimately i
[10:44] believe that the athlete will be the one
[10:45] that will obviously reap the most
[10:46] benefits which is the most important
[10:48] piece of this and lastly i just want to
[10:50] touch on the theme of explanation over
[10:53] experience so i'll going through all
[10:55] these posters and obviously i'm you know
[10:57] fortunate enough to be a panelist we'll
[10:58] look at some of this great work that's
[10:59] been done
[11:00] all of the explanations that were
[11:02] created were incredible explanations
[11:05] right you guys decided you you went a
[11:06] certain route to try to decide on how
[11:08] you could come to this explanation and
[11:11] when you guys came to this explanation
[11:13] you decided that that was the most
[11:14] robust defense of your findings right so
[11:17] when it comes to sport performance that
[11:19] should be the case it should be your
[11:21] explanation over your experience your
[11:23] experience level and and how long you've
[11:25] been doing something to me it's almost
[11:27] meaningless because i know that if
[11:29] regardless of how long you've been doing
[11:30] something if i come to you with the
[11:32] whole concept of the best idea wins if i
[11:35] have an explanation as to why this may
[11:36] be better for a particular athlete at
[11:38] this particular point in time and my my
[11:40] defense holds up stronger than yours
[11:42] then my idea should win and if you are
[11:44] someone who's been in the fields for x
[11:45] amount of years but you don't have great
[11:46] explanations for why the things are why
[11:48] you're doing the things that you're
[11:49] doing well i'm sorry but eventually
[11:51] you're going to be overridden and you're
[11:53] going to actually be pushed to the side
[11:54] because the explanation needs to come
[11:56] through
[11:57] um
[11:58] and so our one last thing i really have
[11:59] to say the idea of hindsight bias is
[12:01] something that we're plagued by in sport
[12:02] structure and what i thought was so
[12:04] interesting for you guys who are going
[12:06] to obviously continue working forward
[12:08] towards data and analytics and again
[12:10] understanding what is
[12:11] we often try to determine whether a
[12:13] certain decision was a mistake or not
[12:16] based off of the outcome right we always
[12:18] do that we based off the outcome like oh
[12:19] like i decided to go this route it
[12:21] worked in my favor well that's great the
[12:23] reality is decisions and mistakes are
[12:26] made in the processes that led up to
[12:28] that particular point in time right so
[12:30] obviously given the information you had
[12:32] at the point in time when you made that
[12:34] decision is actually what determines
[12:35] whether that was a mistake or not
[12:37] regardless of the outcome and we see it
[12:38] all the time in sport performance where
[12:40] a coach will say
[12:41] well we won so i must have done the
[12:43] right things right and then obviously we
[12:45] know that isn't the case so i i continue
[12:47] to implore you to
[12:49] try to find ways to have better
[12:50] explanations for things and to create
[12:52] more scenarios where you're making
[12:54] decisions
[12:56] pre
[12:57] outcome that will help influence and get
[12:59] at least get you a little bit closer to
[13:01] be able to make more robust decisions
[13:02] prior to finding out what those outcomes
[13:04] are so um again this is a very deep
[13:07] topic it's obviously what i'm very
[13:08] passionate about i appreciate you guys
[13:10] giving me the opportunity to talk about
[13:11] this i really hope that you guys
[13:13] continue to move forward and just try to
[13:14] create more robust explanations as to
[13:16] why you believe that your particular
[13:19] work is the best and what can continue
[13:21] to drive everybody in the right
[13:22] direction thank you
[13:24] thank you
[13:25] our next speaker is deviant pluhler
[13:28] director of analytics toronto football
[13:30] club the team happens to be using uconn
[13:33] stadium recently let's welcome devin
[13:37] hello thanks for having me um you know
[13:39] i'm going to keep it uh nice and short
[13:42] and uh sharp here um you know my name my
[13:44] name is evan pluhler i'm the director of
[13:46] analytics at toronto fc i've been up
[13:48] there about uh
[13:50] five or six seasons now which is crazy
[13:52] to think about i'm responsible for the
[13:54] integration of analytics and data
[13:56] science and all the sports facing uh
[13:59] aspects of the
[14:01] organization uh we're part of the larger
[14:03] maple leafs and sports entertainment
[14:04] group uh which has obviously been really
[14:06] exciting over the last couple years with
[14:07] the raptor success and we've had to bid
[14:09] ourselves as well um you know largely
[14:12] you know what i work on on a day-to-day
[14:13] basis is are things like uh player
[14:16] recruitment and opposition analysis and
[14:19] how data science and
[14:21] uh analysis can kind of make those
[14:23] different pieces of our organization
[14:25] more efficient and faster
[14:27] i'm actually from the new england area
[14:28] originally i'm from gloucester
[14:30] massachusetts not not too far from from
[14:33] uconn i definitely played quite a few
[14:35] games down in the uh hartford area
[14:37] growing up um
[14:39] but uh because of covet i haven't been
[14:41] home in about a year i haven't been home
[14:43] since the mit conference back in what is
[14:45] that february ish
[14:48] so i'm happy to be visiting virtually uh
[14:50] if nothing else um though i am
[14:52] admittedly pretty happy to be hanging
[14:55] out above the border uh for this last
[14:57] month before before a certain election
[14:59] happens um you know covet obviously has
[15:02] been uh pretty awful um in a lot of
[15:05] senses um and but it has made some
[15:07] pretty funny bed fellows in toronto fc
[15:09] and uh yukon uh and for those that don't
[15:12] know uh we have made wrensler stadium
[15:14] our home away from home and uh from
[15:17] everyone that i've heard from on the
[15:18] ground down there uh the staff has
[15:20] really bent over backwards uh for us an
[15:23] organization and really have made it
[15:24] felt
[15:25] genuinely like a home uh so i do want to
[15:28] extend you know a sincere thank you from
[15:30] our organization to the yukon sports
[15:32] department uh and community uh for their
[15:35] hospitality uh but but i have to say as
[15:37] an analytics guy i was naturally pretty
[15:39] suspicious of what the actual home field
[15:42] advantage would be with using such a
[15:44] surrogate home field um
[15:46] but uh you know i'm not sure if our our
[15:49] two wins and zero losses start as a
[15:51] sufficient sample size to really draw
[15:53] any real conclusions but but i am
[15:56] optimistic so uh that's it for me thank
[15:59] you uh and enjoy the enjoy the
[16:01] conference
[16:03] thank you devin our last speaker is dr
[16:06] michael lopez director of football data
[16:09] and analytics
[16:10] national football league he's the one
[16:12] behind the big data ball of the nfl
[16:15] let's welcome mike
[16:18] great thanks june and
[16:20] devin i can assure you that two out of
[16:22] two is 100 and so that's uh pretty
[16:25] significant in my opinion
[16:26] um i'm uh i work at the national
[16:29] football league and i work in our
[16:30] football data and analytics group our
[16:32] job at the league office is to use data
[16:34] to enhance and better understand the
[16:36] game of football that comes in a variety
[16:38] of ways that's the competitiveness on
[16:40] the field
[16:41] that's the health and safety
[16:44] of our players
[16:45] that's our officiating pace of play
[16:47] player conduct all those types of things
[16:49] i think given that this is a conference
[16:51] driven for students i want to think back
[16:53] to my days as a student quickly
[16:55] when i was a college student
[16:58] we were i was interested in doing
[17:00] statistics
[17:02] but at that point it was the early 2000s
[17:03] and there wasn't a lot of data to look
[17:05] into
[17:07] and
[17:08] at that point my only real option was to
[17:11] go online and find baseball statistics
[17:13] but there wasn't an easy way of getting
[17:15] baseball statistics so as a result my
[17:18] baseball thesis as an undergraduate at
[17:20] bates college
[17:21] consisted of copying and pasting all the
[17:23] players with the last names a and b
[17:26] into an excel spreadsheet and then
[17:27] analyzing that data in r
[17:30] why did i choose a and b well because it
[17:31] was the start of the alphabet for first
[17:33] and secondly because i like barry bonds
[17:36] who who at the time in 2003 was was
[17:39] hitting some home runs for various
[17:40] reasons
[17:41] in any case the world of sports looks a
[17:43] lot different hopefully you wouldn't do
[17:44] a senior thesis with players with the
[17:46] last name a and b now
[17:47] in large part because the data out there
[17:49] is so much more expansive
[17:51] correspondingly the opportunities for
[17:53] folks in sports data analytics are much
[17:55] wider than they are in 2003. i wrote my
[17:57] thesis and i got a couple suggestions to
[17:59] send via mail
[18:01] to people on baseball teams and so i
[18:04] sent out my thesis to random baseball
[18:06] teams saying hey i wrote this get me a
[18:08] job
[18:09] not surprisingly that didn't lead to a
[18:10] lot of opportunities it actually took me
[18:13] about 15 years to actually get a
[18:15] full-time job in sports and that's where
[18:17] i am now
[18:18] the opportunities for students now are
[18:19] much wider i work in the league office
[18:22] there's obviously jobs on teams
[18:24] uh vendors that work with sports
[18:26] organizations and football that would be
[18:27] like pff telemetry sports uh those types
[18:31] of organizations uh have have also
[18:33] opportunities for folks in sports
[18:35] anthony imagine sports science in
[18:37] working with data that that deals with
[18:39] players and their health and their their
[18:40] practice data that's certainly an option
[18:43] um so i encourage you to consider this
[18:44] as a long-term option today you'll hear
[18:47] a lot of excellent talks uh and the
[18:49] keynote presentations will give you an
[18:50] idea of sort of what goes on into into
[18:53] transformative uh research that can help
[18:55] professional organizations whether it be
[18:57] teams or league office
[18:59] on that note i'm going to introduce one
[19:01] of our data analysts at the league
[19:03] office tom bliss who's going to start
[19:06] with a presentation about how our
[19:08] football group can use data to better
[19:10] understand the game of football
