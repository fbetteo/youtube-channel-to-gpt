[01:51] eric
[01:53] i will make you
[01:54] presenter now so you can share your
[01:56] screen
[02:01] thank you thank you uh yeah please
[02:03] meaning welcoming eric
[02:07] thanks so actually before i get into my
[02:09] talk seth said something that resonated
[02:12] for me and so i want to spend a minute
[02:14] agreeing with him and echoing it a
[02:15] little bit more
[02:16] i'll tell you a story i um
[02:19] actually taught a course in sports
[02:21] analytics at santa clara university
[02:24] and they reached out to me and asked me
[02:26] to do it
[02:27] and i said i i don't think you have the
[02:29] right person right like my training is
[02:31] in chemistry i'm i don't have a strong
[02:34] statistical background i've taught
[02:36] myself a little bit but i shouldn't be
[02:38] teaching graduate students how to do
[02:40] this since you need someone more
[02:42] qualified than me
[02:44] and they explained to me the reason they
[02:45] were coming to me was they had started
[02:48] this data science program and they'd met
[02:50] with leaders from companies like google
[02:52] and facebook and whatever other
[02:54] companies that were heavily involved in
[02:56] data science and machine learning and
[02:58] asked them what they wanted to see from
[02:59] their students that they were looking to
[03:01] hire
[03:02] they said there were three things they
[03:04] were looking for
[03:05] one was
[03:06] computer programming skills
[03:08] one was statistical analysis skills
[03:11] and what the companies told the
[03:14] university was
[03:16] every program turns out people with
[03:17] those two skills what most programs seem
[03:20] to overlook is the third thing which is
[03:22] an understanding of how to use data and
[03:25] intuition about where to go with it and
[03:26] how to think about it and they were
[03:28] asking me to teach a class in that
[03:31] and i was like perfect that's what i am
[03:33] good at is thinking through
[03:36] sort of where your analysis might be
[03:38] wrong
[03:39] how to come up with an answer to a
[03:41] question like who's the best three-point
[03:42] shooter when you're gonna have a bunch
[03:44] of murky pieces of information that
[03:46] don't quite tell the whole story
[03:48] and
[03:49] reasoning through that i think is a real
[03:51] skill and it's something you can
[03:53] practice and the way i had my students
[03:56] practice it was
[03:57] we took papers from blogs or journal
[04:01] articles
[04:02] and we talked through
[04:04] you know if this turns out to be wrong
[04:06] what's the most likely reason why and
[04:08] how could we test for that and how could
[04:10] we think about it and i think that is
[04:12] something that you can do on your own or
[04:14] with others and just
[04:16] train your creativity and your problem
[04:18] solving to think about how to get a
[04:20] complete answer
[04:23] with that being said i will now
[04:26] give it to the actual point of my talk
[04:30] so
[04:33] see my screen now
[04:38] yes
[04:39] so uh my talk today is about
[04:43] as a team employee how we can make use
[04:45] of work that's in the public domain
[04:48] and you heard from my introduction i
[04:50] spent a few years writing in the public
[04:52] domain i've worked in academia
[04:54] publishing in academic journals i've
[04:57] done sports analysis for blogs and so i
[04:59] kind of have had my foot in each of
[05:02] these areas and i think that makes me
[05:04] well positioned to think about how to
[05:06] get good use from all of them
[05:09] so i'm going to start by talking through
[05:11] there are some real advantages to being
[05:13] in-house and i will highlight those a
[05:16] little bit
[05:17] but the point of my talk and i what i
[05:19] want to get to is talking about what the
[05:21] strengths are from public domain work
[05:23] and
[05:24] why teams should be paying attention to
[05:26] that as well
[05:27] and then kind of what the best practices
[05:29] are and how to make use of everything
[05:33] so
[05:33] let's start with the movie we're gonna
[05:35] watch a football play here first run
[05:38] through let's just see what happens
[05:47] all right
[05:48] so ram scored a touchdown there and as
[05:51] an analyst the first question you might
[05:53] ask is how much is that play worth
[05:55] and
[05:56] there are a variety of ways of thinking
[05:57] about that right so one simple answer is
[06:00] well you got seven points for a
[06:01] touchdown
[06:03] but that's not quite right you really
[06:05] get six points and a chance at a point
[06:08] after touchdown point after is almost
[06:10] always good but not quite always so if
[06:12] you count for those missed ones maybe
[06:14] it's a little bit under seven
[06:16] but where analysts start getting
[06:17] involved is you might say well
[06:19] okay you got seven points on that play
[06:21] but you had a chance to score even
[06:23] before that and if you think about they
[06:25] were near midfield
[06:27] you know when you worked through the
[06:29] likelihood that they were going to score
[06:30] they're kind of expected points from
[06:32] that possession that play really only
[06:35] increased their expected outcome by
[06:37] about five points
[06:39] and other analysts might say well points
[06:41] aren't the goal here the goal is wins so
[06:43] let's not even talk about expected
[06:45] points let's talk about wind probability
[06:47] and that play increased their chance of
[06:49] winning the game by seven percent
[06:52] someone else might talk to those last
[06:53] two and say hold on when you're talking
[06:54] about expected points or win probability
[06:57] are you using average teams here are you
[06:59] factoring in how much better this team
[07:01] is than their opponent
[07:03] because i think they were already 94 to
[07:06] win the game before that play so it
[07:08] couldn't have increased their chances by
[07:09] 7 when you think about how good they
[07:11] were
[07:12] all these are reasonable questions any
[07:14] of these frameworks is a reasonable way
[07:16] to think about it
[07:18] and you you kind of have to decide which
[07:19] framework you want to use but once you
[07:21] do that
[07:22] you can calculate an answer to this
[07:24] there is
[07:25] a right answer to what this play is
[07:27] worth and
[07:28] you can come you can work through all of
[07:30] the things you want to think about in
[07:32] your framework and come up with that
[07:33] answer
[07:34] where things get harder is when you want
[07:36] to talk about individual players and
[07:39] if we think this play was worth five
[07:41] points or seven win percent how much
[07:44] credit do we give to each player
[07:47] so i've highlighted here the receiver
[07:48] who's going to get open
[07:50] he runs what's called a post route he
[07:51] runs down the field about 20 yards and
[07:54] then cuts diagonally across the field
[07:58] these are the three defenders who end up
[07:59] trailing him on the play and so i want
[08:02] you to think about which of them
[08:04] deserves the blame for this who should
[08:05] have been going with him
[08:16] so you've seen it a second time now i
[08:18] hope you're watching those three
[08:19] defenders let's back up a little bit
[08:21] here
[08:22] to the key point where they kind of lose
[08:24] him and he breaks into the open
[08:26] now i take a poll now
[08:28] so decide for yourself
[08:30] do you think it was player number one's
[08:32] fault player number two's fault player
[08:34] number three is fall
[08:36] let's raise your hand if you think it
[08:38] was player number one who should have
[08:39] been with him
[08:42] raise your hand if you think it was
[08:43] number two
[08:45] raise your hand if you think it was
[08:47] number three
[08:49] okay so i can't see any of your hands so
[08:51] that was kind of a silly exercise
[08:54] but i'm going to tell you even without
[08:56] seeing your hands that all of you were
[08:57] wrong
[08:58] and the reason you're wrong is you just
[09:00] don't have enough information to answer
[09:01] the question
[09:04] so
[09:04] what i can tell you is on this kind of
[09:07] play player number one is responsible
[09:09] for these short routes he carries the
[09:11] player down the field
[09:14] through the early part of the route
[09:16] and then player two and three are
[09:17] responsible for the deep parts of the
[09:19] field their job is to protect against
[09:21] the deep plays
[09:23] so player number two is on this side of
[09:24] the field he has two guys coming into
[09:26] his area and he he just can't cover both
[09:29] of them and so his job has to be the one
[09:31] to the outside because there's no help
[09:33] there so it's definitely not his fault
[09:36] but what's unclear
[09:39] is whether player number one should be
[09:40] staying with the receiver as he goes
[09:42] down the field or whether player number
[09:44] three should be recognizing what
[09:46] what that offensive player is doing and
[09:48] getting over to pick him up
[09:50] and the reason you can't answer is
[09:52] different coaches would ask the players
[09:53] to do different things here
[09:55] some pla some coaches would say player
[09:58] number one can see that number two is
[10:00] occupied and he can't release this guy
[10:02] he knows he needs to stay with him
[10:05] other coaches would say number one is
[10:07] going to be behind him because his job
[10:09] was these short routes so we need number
[10:11] three to be the one who recognizes that
[10:13] number two is occupied and get over the
[10:14] top
[10:16] and it's just not if you don't know what
[10:17] the coaches were telling them you can't
[10:19] assign the blame
[10:20] and so that's why access is important
[10:23] that's one of the advantages that people
[10:25] working for a team have
[10:26] is you really can't assign blame until
[10:29] you know what people are being asked to
[10:31] do you can't assign credit until you
[10:33] know whether what their job was on the
[10:35] play either
[10:37] so when you start
[10:38] when you start with how impactful was
[10:40] this play you can do that without access
[10:43] but when you want to assign the credit
[10:46] you need to be able to sort through
[10:48] maybe the coaches deserve credit for
[10:50] designing routes for the receivers that
[10:52] created this pressure on the defense
[10:54] maybe the defensive coaches deserve some
[10:56] blame for designing a coverage scheme
[10:59] that had this weakness
[11:01] maybe the
[11:02] uh receiver deserves some credit for
[11:05] executing this route well for being fast
[11:07] enough or deceptive enough to get into
[11:09] that weak spot
[11:11] and then probably at least one of the
[11:13] players in coverage deserves some blame
[11:15] for not recognizing what was happening
[11:17] and making the coverage and that's just
[11:19] for the part where the receiver gets
[11:21] open you have all these same questions
[11:23] when you think about why the quarterback
[11:25] had so much time and how the blockers
[11:27] performed and what they were being asked
[11:29] to do
[11:31] that's all a hard problem in general but
[11:33] without the access to know what they
[11:35] were being asked to it's not a solvable
[11:37] problem you can only estimate
[11:39] and so that is going to be a limitation
[11:41] for people who are working in the public
[11:43] domain
[11:45] another limitation they'll often face is
[11:47] just the quality of the data so i'm
[11:49] going to shift to hockey now and show
[11:50] you a play from our team
[11:52] uh
[11:53] carolina hurricanes we're in white
[11:55] playing against the columbus blue
[11:56] jackets
[11:57] so the blue jackets send the puck out we
[12:00] gather it and we bring it back in now
[12:02] that's not a terribly dangerous
[12:04] situation we have two offensive players
[12:06] against two defensive players who are in
[12:07] pretty good position there's two more
[12:10] players behind them uh coming down to
[12:12] close it down so it shouldn't be that
[12:14] dangerous
[12:15] until
[12:16] he gets over there and
[12:18] wow the in the net that was
[12:20] amazing everybody's really excited we
[12:21] got a hug for that one billy's
[12:24] disappointed the coach cannot figure out
[12:27] what happened he's looking for
[12:28] information somebody explained to me
[12:30] what happened there player wants to know
[12:32] too how did i make that happen
[12:35] and so let's turn to the nhl and see
[12:37] what the nhl data can tell us this is
[12:39] what an nhl play-by-play looks like
[12:41] there's a series of events so there's a
[12:43] face-off that we want in the offensive
[12:45] zone
[12:46] the next thing they record is one of our
[12:48] players missed a shot
[12:50] one of their players hit somebody and so
[12:52] on
[12:54] and what i want to focus on at the
[12:56] bottom here so this is the goal that you
[12:58] just watched and the play before it you
[13:00] can see was 23 seconds earlier so we
[13:03] have a 23 second gap between when one of
[13:06] our players hit someone in the offensive
[13:08] zone and the goal being scored we have
[13:10] no information about what happened in
[13:12] those 23 seconds
[13:14] and to give you an idea of how long 23
[13:16] seconds is these columns show which
[13:18] players were on the ice for each team
[13:21] and you can see that in between aside
[13:23] from our goalie all five of our players
[13:25] left the ice
[13:26] so the nhl provides a blogger with no
[13:29] information about what any of our five
[13:31] guys did to make this happen
[13:33] other than that we scored
[13:35] so you can record as a team we created a
[13:38] dangerous chance from four feet away
[13:40] we converted on it scored a goal but
[13:43] assigning individual credits players for
[13:45] how that came about it's going to be
[13:47] pretty hard without more data
[13:49] and
[13:51] when you want to divide it up you need
[13:53] to have a more rich play-by-play or more
[13:56] information than what was here
[13:58] at the season level you might be able to
[14:00] infer a player's impact by looking at
[14:04] how often good things happen when
[14:05] they're on the ice how often bad things
[14:07] happen
[14:08] and
[14:09] maybe you can correct for who he's
[14:11] playing with who he's playing against
[14:13] what kind of situations he's in but on
[14:16] any individual play trying to say what
[14:18] he did you just don't have the data from
[14:20] the nhl's playbook
[14:22] people in the public domain have started
[14:24] trying to fill in that goal and start
[14:26] tracking things by hand
[14:28] to record more of the individual
[14:29] contributions and make that more rich
[14:32] play-by-play that tells you things like
[14:34] who passed the to the player that
[14:36] got the scoring chance and what kind of
[14:38] pass was it
[14:40] and
[14:41] that helps a lot it gets you one step
[14:43] closer to being able what you want to do
[14:46] but
[14:47] to really do it well there's a level of
[14:49] detail that you really just can't do it
[14:52] by hand at scale so you might be able to
[14:54] go through if there's 20 or 30 scoring
[14:56] chances in a game you might be able to
[14:58] record the pass that led to each of
[15:00] those and some information about that
[15:02] pass but if we're gonna talk about a
[15:04] sequence of five or ten passes that led
[15:06] up to it and what each player did
[15:08] it's going to be really hard to record
[15:10] that much information
[15:12] if you want to start talking about all
[15:14] of the movements that players made to
[15:16] make that pass possible which offensive
[15:18] player
[15:19] cut somewhere to occupy a defender which
[15:22] defender lost his manning coverage
[15:25] that's going to be essentially
[15:27] impossible to do by hand
[15:29] if you want to talk about the pastor you
[15:31] need to not just know what paths he made
[15:33] but what other passing options he had
[15:35] available and didn't make so you can
[15:38] start to grade his vision you can see
[15:40] where this just there's a level of
[15:41] information that you're never going to
[15:43] be able to report
[15:46] and so that's those are the two things
[15:48] that i think give an in-house down the
[15:50] list the most advantage the access to
[15:53] coaches to understand what players were
[15:55] being asked to do
[15:56] and the data to really track in detail
[15:59] the extent to which they did it
[16:02] and data here we you know i talked about
[16:04] playback play
[16:05] uh you heard
[16:07] that in field hockey as well as other
[16:09] sports there's gps trackers to keep
[16:11] track of where players are at all times
[16:14] data also includes things like scouting
[16:16] reports and
[16:18] basically any information we have
[16:20] there's a lot of information that we
[16:21] collect in the house that someone in the
[16:24] public domain might not have access to
[16:26] and so there is a real advantage to
[16:28] being in-house and there are reasons why
[16:31] people who are working for teams tend to
[16:33] assume
[16:34] they have all the information and there
[16:36] isn't much to add from the public domain
[16:38] and i think that there's a step that
[16:40] they're missing there they do have all
[16:42] of the information and a lot of
[16:44] advantages but there are still some real
[16:46] advantages from the public domain and i
[16:48] think it's important to think those
[16:50] through and take advantage of them
[16:52] wherever you can
[16:53] so i'm gonna pivot now to talking about
[16:56] what i why i think the public domain has
[16:58] a lot to offer and how we can go about
[17:00] making use of that
[17:02] so one simple advantage is just
[17:04] technical of horsepower
[17:06] teams invest a lot in this stuff but
[17:09] there is a really broad world outside of
[17:11] teams
[17:12] so somebody named shayna goldman
[17:14] compiles a list of everybody who's on
[17:16] team websites in
[17:18] what appears to be a data adjacent role
[17:21] and there are about 100 of them across
[17:23] the league something like 32 of them
[17:26] have a degree in a stem field based on
[17:28] my searches of team bios and linkedin
[17:31] and whatever else like
[17:33] included 22 graduate degrees
[17:35] that's a lot of horsepower if you get
[17:37] 100 people together with 22 graduate
[17:39] degrees and 30 stem degrees
[17:42] there's a lot of ability there and a lot
[17:44] that you could do when you compare it to
[17:46] what exists in the broader world it's
[17:49] it's not really that much
[17:50] just one university nearby us nc state
[17:54] in just one department their statistics
[17:57] department they have 41 faculty members
[18:00] and 125 graduate students
[18:02] so just that one department at the one
[18:04] school
[18:05] has more horsepower than the entire nhl
[18:08] does
[18:09] now
[18:10] obviously they aren't all working on
[18:12] hockey yet
[18:14] but
[18:15] like we heard in the field hockey
[18:16] example in the opening remarks
[18:18] once you start giving those people some
[18:20] interesting data and putting interesting
[18:22] problems in front of them
[18:24] they're not going to be able to help but
[18:26] get engaged and want to help you solve
[18:28] some of these problems and
[18:30] i do think there is an ability to tap
[18:32] into that that
[18:35] the teams can take real advantage of
[18:39] so some examples of work that's being
[18:41] done in the public domain
[18:43] i think the academic research literature
[18:46] is a really good place to find people
[18:48] using that horsepower to develop some
[18:50] innovative techniques and apply the
[18:53] cutting edge
[18:54] best practice methods to solving
[18:56] problems
[18:57] so i have an example here there's an old
[18:59] rule that uh when somebody on an
[19:02] organizing committee invites you to give
[19:03] a talk at a symposium you have to make
[19:05] sure you
[19:06] you return the favor by promoting some
[19:08] of their work so this is a
[19:11] plot from a publication um
[19:14] that looked at how often the best team
[19:16] wins across sports and that's something
[19:19] where
[19:20] [Music]
[19:21] the arithmetic
[19:23] can be done in an individual sport in a
[19:25] relatively simple way
[19:27] uh the innovation that they had in this
[19:29] paper was coming up with a way to
[19:31] compare across sports and make it so you
[19:33] could start answering questions like
[19:36] how much more random is an nhl playoff
[19:38] series than an nba playoff series and as
[19:41] a league we might be interested in that
[19:43] kind of question and whether we have too
[19:45] much or too little randomness
[19:49] another example of technical horsepower
[19:50] comes from a more hockey specific
[19:53] example here so i'll give you some
[19:54] background for people who
[19:56] are not neck deep in hockey
[19:59] the nhl is the top league in hockey
[20:02] but
[20:03] lots of other leagues
[20:05] are of interest to us as well there are
[20:07] prospects and free agents who come out
[20:09] of leagues all over the world and in the
[20:11] draft we need to think about all the
[20:12] leads they're coming from as well
[20:15] and so
[20:16] when we want to think about how to
[20:18] evaluate a player we need to have some
[20:20] sense of how strong each of those
[20:21] leagues are
[20:22] and it's a little bit like the minor
[20:24] league issue in baseball but it's
[20:26] i think it's significantly more
[20:27] challenging here
[20:29] because you're trying to compare such
[20:31] desperate leagues from
[20:33] the nhl
[20:35] to
[20:35] a canadian junior hockey league where
[20:37] everybody's 21 and under
[20:40] to
[20:41] the top men's professional league in
[20:43] russia to the minor league in russia
[20:46] to the
[20:47] under 18 league in sweden they're all
[20:50] these different leagues and comparing
[20:51] across them is not easy
[20:53] and something that we knew was important
[20:55] and for a long time people were doing it
[20:57] in a kind of simple pairwise fashion
[20:59] where you take players who are in one
[21:01] league one year and move to another
[21:03] league the next year
[21:04] and look at how their production changed
[21:07] and take that as an assessment of which
[21:08] league is stronger
[21:11] and you can do that in a pairwise
[21:12] fashion but you run into problems where
[21:15] the translation from league a to league
[21:17] b says something
[21:18] the translation from league b to league
[21:20] c says something but if you chain those
[21:22] together you get a different answer from
[21:24] if you go straight from a to c
[21:26] and so the innovation in this paper that
[21:29] i'm citing
[21:30] was using some more advanced statistical
[21:33] methods to model globally the
[21:36] translation factors across all the leaks
[21:39] and take into account all those
[21:40] individual interactions to try to really
[21:43] step rank the leads and make it so we
[21:45] can start to compare prospects and
[21:48] potential free agent signings from all
[21:50] over the world
[21:52] so there's a lot of technical horsepower
[21:53] in the public domain
[21:55] there are a hundred team employees and
[21:57] that is a lot
[21:58] but it's not a hundred employees working
[22:00] in a single group we're we're in 32
[22:03] individual teams that are by design
[22:05] isolated and when you start cutting
[22:08] things up like that those individual
[22:09] groups are actually not that big and
[22:12] there's a loss of connectivity there
[22:14] that i think is really important
[22:16] people
[22:17] when you think of an inventor or an
[22:19] invention
[22:20] the sort of stereotype is this guy in
[22:22] the lab by himself locked away no
[22:25] contact with any humans until he comes
[22:27] out running excited and screaming about
[22:29] his fantastic new invention
[22:32] and that's really not how invention work
[22:34] invention comes from having
[22:36] conversations with people who see things
[22:38] differently from you and letting your
[22:40] ideas cross pollinate with theirs and
[22:42] come up with new things
[22:44] and that's something that obviously the
[22:46] public domain can do
[22:47] in a way that a team that's trying to
[22:49] get a proprietary edge count as easily
[22:53] so i'll give you another example of a
[22:55] place where that showed up in hockey so
[22:59] transitioning to thinking about expected
[23:01] values comes pretty early in most sports
[23:05] those of you familiar with baseball
[23:07] probably have heard of the rune
[23:08] expectancy matrix those be familiar with
[23:10] soccer thought about expected goals
[23:13] there's expected points in american
[23:15] football each sport has kind of made
[23:17] this transition and just like all the
[23:19] other sports early on in hockey people
[23:21] said oh we need to be able to make an
[23:23] expected goals model predict how likely
[23:25] it is that a shot will go in
[23:28] and stop just counting shots switch to
[23:31] counting expected goals
[23:33] they did that early on
[23:35] and
[23:36] went to use it to make predictions and
[23:38] found out that it was actually worse
[23:41] than just counting shots
[23:44] and that's strange and it's hard to
[23:45] believe until you think about what that
[23:47] data looked like and when you have these
[23:49] huge gaps in the data and really not
[23:52] very much information about what
[23:53] happened
[23:54] it may be that your expected goals
[23:56] calculation isn't reliable enough to
[23:58] make those kind of predictions
[24:01] and
[24:02] there was a decade of back and forth in
[24:04] blogs where people were coming up with
[24:06] new innovations about how to add a
[24:09] little bit more information to the shop
[24:11] how to tease apart
[24:13] things from the sequence of events in
[24:15] the play-by-play to tell you a little
[24:17] bit more than what we had from just the
[24:19] individual play
[24:21] and that back and forth over 10 years
[24:23] eventually got to where there was a
[24:24] published model
[24:26] that had a test of predictive power and
[24:28] showed that it improved predictions over
[24:31] just using simple shots
[24:33] and
[24:34] that discourse that back and forth
[24:37] would have been a lot harder to do in a
[24:38] team environment
[24:40] and
[24:41] i think that's a really important thing
[24:43] for
[24:43] finding flaws in your approach and
[24:45] coming up with new wrinkles to consider
[24:50] so
[24:52] tying things together a little bit here
[24:54] i
[24:55] i think those new ideas are
[24:58] one of the most precious commodities
[24:59] there is in any research field really
[25:03] and going through blogs and journals is
[25:05] a really valuable way to find some of
[25:07] those ideas and maybe you're just using
[25:10] their idea as is or maybe it triggers
[25:12] something for you and you think about
[25:14] how you can take the data that you have
[25:16] or the access that you have or some
[25:18] other problem that you've been thinking
[25:19] about
[25:20] and use their idea as a starting point
[25:22] for approaching this thing
[25:25] you can also be more active and
[25:27] get
[25:28] researchers in the public domain engaged
[25:30] in working with your fancy data
[25:33] so i have a couple examples here the one
[25:34] on the left is from where
[25:36] one of those enriched play-by-plays that
[25:39] has information about every pass was
[25:41] provided to contestants in the data
[25:43] competition
[25:45] and this example here solves the problem
[25:47] that we talked about in the hockey video
[25:50] of assessing the impact of each pass in
[25:52] sequence and what all the players did
[25:55] individually to lead to an opportunity
[25:57] to score
[25:59] on the right is from an nfl's data
[26:01] competition
[26:03] where
[26:04] uh
[26:05] contestants were given information about
[26:07] the location of players at all time and
[26:09] solved the problem that we had from our
[26:10] football play of assessing
[26:13] uh at what point the player became open
[26:16] and how likely they were to
[26:19] complete the pass
[26:20] and
[26:21] this didn't actually get into who was
[26:23] responsible for that but you could see
[26:25] where a starting point of identifying
[26:27] when and where they came open and how
[26:29] open they were
[26:30] would get you towards that
[26:32] and so i think this kind of
[26:34] opportunity to engage people in the
[26:36] public domain and have them
[26:39] come up with ideas for you or with you
[26:41] and work through some of the ways about
[26:44] how to solve them is something that
[26:46] teams really can
[26:47] get a lot of benefit from
[26:50] i'm going gonna pivot now and talk about
[26:52] something that
[26:53] i think
[26:54] is um
[26:56] separate from those other things in a
[26:58] certain way it's it's a
[27:00] form of benefit just from having an
[27:03] outside opinion
[27:04] so they're always going to be challenges
[27:06] when you're trying to evaluate your own
[27:08] team
[27:09] there's
[27:10] just as a starting point i think leaders
[27:14] are almost always inherently optimistic
[27:17] it's part of what makes people good at
[27:19] selling their vision and getting people
[27:21] excited to work with them
[27:23] is
[27:24] being able to explain why you think this
[27:26] is right and be excited about it and
[27:27] have that be a genuine belief that what
[27:29] you're doing is the right way to do it
[27:32] that optimism is good for getting people
[27:34] excited about your problem but it does
[27:37] have a downside when it comes time to
[27:40] assess your situation
[27:42] there are also some psychological biases
[27:44] so confirmation bias is the tendency to
[27:48] when you have an opinion um
[27:52] pay more attention to and give more
[27:55] weight to evidence that supports your
[27:57] opinion than the evidence that
[27:58] contradicts your opinion
[28:00] and so that's an inherent tendency that
[28:02] people have and so
[28:05] if you think a certain player is good
[28:06] and go out and fire them
[28:08] and then you start watching them you're
[28:10] going to have a tendency to recognize
[28:13] and remember the things he does well and
[28:15] say i knew it that player's really good
[28:17] and maybe overlook some of the things
[28:19] that he struggles with a little bit
[28:22] and
[28:22] that will tend to make you even more
[28:24] optimistic about your players and your
[28:26] team
[28:28] the endowment effect is another
[28:29] psychological bias that can play in so
[28:32] that's the tendency to value
[28:35] uh objects or assets that you have
[28:38] more than you would value an equivalent
[28:40] object or asset that is not currently in
[28:43] your possession
[28:44] so if you have a player and a team comes
[28:46] to and says they're interested in the
[28:48] player they'll trade you a third round
[28:50] draft pick for him
[28:51] your reaction might be no way this guy
[28:53] is incredibly valuable he's worth way
[28:54] more than a third round pick
[28:56] some other team has a similar player
[28:58] and asked if you would give up a third
[29:00] round pick for them
[29:02] of course not that guy's not worth
[29:03] anywhere near as much and it's a it's
[29:06] essentially a form of overvaluing your
[29:08] own players and again it
[29:10] all of these psychological biases
[29:13] lead teams being
[29:15] a little more optimistic about their
[29:17] team than they should be in general
[29:20] but i think there's something even more
[29:22] insidious underlying
[29:24] that leads to hyper optimism
[29:27] even if you have no psychological
[29:28] effects at all so
[29:30] let's imagine
[29:32] i built a robot we programmed the robot
[29:34] to evaluate players and teams and let it
[29:37] make all of our decisions
[29:39] i think that robot's still going to be
[29:40] too optimistic about whatever team it
[29:42] builds and i'll take a minute to walk
[29:44] you through why that would be
[29:47] so let's imagine
[29:48] we have this hockey player he's a free
[29:50] agent and we need to decide what these
[29:52] were now
[29:56] you can't really know for sure right
[29:57] there's there's
[29:59] we just don't we have not yet solved
[30:01] taki to the point where we can say
[30:03] unequivocally what a player's value is
[30:06] for the sake of this conversation
[30:08] let's assume we have access to an
[30:10] ammunition being
[30:12] and that omniscient being tells you and
[30:14] me
[30:15] that this player's worth three million
[30:16] dollars
[30:18] but the rest of the teams in the league
[30:19] don't know that and we're going to sit
[30:21] back and watch what happens
[30:23] so they each have their own opinions
[30:25] they each see the game a little bit
[30:26] differently maybe their scouts saw the
[30:28] player at different games
[30:30] and they each have different opinions
[30:31] about what the player is worth
[30:34] it's just at the low end one team
[30:37] manager thinks the player's worth about
[30:38] two and a half million at the high end
[30:40] one team manager thinks he's worth about
[30:42] four million
[30:44] so
[30:44] when we go into this auction in free
[30:46] agency the person who thinks he's worth
[30:49] the most will end up being the one who
[30:51] signs him he will effectively out-bid
[30:53] the other teams
[30:55] but when you think about how much he
[30:56] signs him for he doesn't have to pay
[30:58] four million for him right that the
[31:00] agent starts going to teams he is asking
[31:02] for two million everybody's in the
[31:04] bidding it gets to two and a half
[31:05] million and the first person drops out
[31:07] of the bidding
[31:09] get up to three million the second
[31:10] person drops out you get above three and
[31:12] a half million and the third person
[31:14] drops out and this guy on the end
[31:16] maybe has to pay a little bit more than
[31:18] 3.5 maybe it's 3.51 maybe it's 3.6 but
[31:22] it's not 4 million
[31:24] so how does he feel about that outcome
[31:27] he thinks he got a bargain right he he
[31:29] thinks he paid a half million dollars
[31:31] less than you should have
[31:33] while everybody else is saying they're
[31:34] you know maybe this third guy is saying
[31:36] yeah that's a reasonable price a little
[31:38] more than i wanted but the other two are
[31:39] saying they're saying that is way too
[31:41] much
[31:42] and nobody in the league knows what the
[31:44] right answer is all we know is that the
[31:46] person who ended up with him is the one
[31:49] who is most optimistic about it
[31:51] and he thinks he just won
[31:54] that's not just true in free agency we
[31:56] see it in the draft too
[31:58] so
[31:59] every year you will hear team executives
[32:01] come out and say
[32:03] you know we were picking 37th and we got
[32:06] this guy who was 15th on our draft board
[32:08] i can't believe how lucky we were
[32:10] and when i was in the public domain
[32:12] i'll be honest i didn't really buy it
[32:14] you know it sounded like something they
[32:15] would just say to try to get fans
[32:17] excited about their draft pick or fight
[32:19] book
[32:21] what a good position the team was in or
[32:22] whatever
[32:24] but when i started to see how different
[32:26] teams draft lists were and think about
[32:28] what that means for this kind of
[32:31] situation
[32:32] you realize that it actually
[32:34] generally is true because it's exactly
[32:36] the same as the free agency situation
[32:40] i it's not exactly the same because you
[32:43] don't always have the opportunity to
[32:44] acquire the player who you like the most
[32:47] if you had him
[32:49] 15th and your next pick was at 30th
[32:52] maybe somebody else takes him at 27th
[32:54] who didn't like it as much as he did so
[32:57] it's not quite like free agency where
[32:58] it's always going to go to the team that
[33:00] wants him most
[33:01] but you're still going to tend to end up
[33:03] with the players who other teams
[33:04] wouldn't have taken that by
[33:06] and you're going to come out of the
[33:08] draft every year saying
[33:10] you got really lucky that a bunch of
[33:12] players fell to you who you would have
[33:14] had ranked
[33:15] ahead of a bunch of people who went
[33:16] earlier
[33:18] and that happens at every step to
[33:20] acquire players and it creates a
[33:22] selection bias whether we're talking
[33:24] about free agency or trades or the draft
[33:28] every time you're adding a player to
[33:29] your roster
[33:30] the tendency will be to end up with a
[33:32] player who you like more than most of
[33:34] the other teams do
[33:36] and so you're going to like your team
[33:37] more than most other teams do
[33:39] and you might be right you know maybe
[33:41] you know more about how to evaluate
[33:43] players than anyone else in the league
[33:45] does maybe they have it wrong and you
[33:46] have it right
[33:48] but
[33:49] if everybody thinks
[33:51] they have it right
[33:53] and they all disagree they can't all be
[33:55] right they can't all
[33:57] have teams that are better than average
[33:59] and so some teams are way too optimistic
[34:02] about their situation
[34:04] and if you're working for a team it's
[34:05] incumbent on you to think about how to
[34:08] assess
[34:09] how confident you should be in your
[34:11] your opinion about your team
[34:14] and that's really important because that
[34:16] assessment of your team
[34:18] plays in when you make decisions about
[34:19] what to do
[34:20] there are lots of opportunities to
[34:23] essentially trade
[34:25] future assets for current assets
[34:28] and if you think your team is really
[34:29] good right now there's a lot of
[34:30] incentive to do that
[34:32] but what if you're wrong
[34:35] and you need to understand
[34:37] no model is perfect there's that old
[34:39] saying but that that includes whether
[34:41] you're using an actual quantitative
[34:43] model or any method you use to decide
[34:45] how good you think your team is it's not
[34:47] going to be perfect
[34:48] and
[34:49] that those imperfections tend to make
[34:52] you more optimistic than you should
[34:54] and i think where there's real value
[34:56] is in essentially ensembling opinions
[34:59] and the good news is the internet has no
[35:01] shortage of opinions about
[35:03] what a team's likely win total will be
[35:06] or their odds of making the playoffs or
[35:08] whatever it might be
[35:09] and so there's a lot of chance there to
[35:11] check your gut instinct or your internal
[35:13] models and see whether the rest of the
[35:16] world agrees with you
[35:18] now you might be right
[35:20] i'm not saying you automatically abandon
[35:22] your opinion
[35:24] but you need to question it if they
[35:25] disagree if they agree with you then
[35:27] maybe you go ahead and make your moves
[35:28] with confidence but if they disagree you
[35:30] need to spend some time thinking about
[35:32] why
[35:33] if you can't answer
[35:35] why those models in the public domain
[35:37] are higher on
[35:39] other players than on yours
[35:41] then you need to be really careful about
[35:43] thinking about whether you're right you
[35:45] still might be
[35:46] but you have to have that caution
[35:50] so put something put it all together now
[35:51] and think about whether the public
[35:54] domain work whether paying attention to
[35:56] it really does lead to an edging
[35:58] practice so i'll take one last taki
[36:00] example here that's another
[36:02] series of uh
[36:04] articles that we're looking at the draft
[36:07] so taking into account how old the
[36:10] player was how many points he scored
[36:12] where what
[36:13] what league played in
[36:14] a bunch of information and trying to
[36:16] project what their future looked like
[36:18] how likely they were to make it how good
[36:19] they were likely to be if they did
[36:23] and
[36:24] this was interesting work and some teams
[36:26] around the league were paying attention
[36:28] to it and some of them were using it
[36:30] directly and some of it were using it as
[36:33] inspiration for further extensions
[36:36] and one team actually went further they
[36:38] went and recruited the researchers who
[36:40] developed this work
[36:41] and integrated them with their scouting
[36:43] staff as consultants
[36:45] and they gave a talk at the mit sports
[36:47] conference
[36:49] a couple years back detailing exactly
[36:51] how they blended their work into their
[36:53] decision making processes
[36:55] and that's how i know they got a lot of
[36:56] value out of it because not only did
[36:58] they go do it but they were happy enough
[37:00] with it to be going out and talking
[37:02] about it and showing examples of
[37:05] players where
[37:08] combining the information they had from
[37:10] these models with the information they
[37:12] had in-house helped them make decisions
[37:16] so in terms of best practices i think
[37:19] passively monitoring the research that's
[37:21] in the field is important just knowing
[37:22] what's out there being able to find
[37:24] those articles about the draft and think
[37:26] about how you can use them but active
[37:28] engagement is even better having these
[37:31] conversations with researchers gives you
[37:34] a chance to sneak out of your little
[37:35] silo every now and then and come across
[37:37] some new ideas and get people engaged
[37:40] if you can partner with academic groups
[37:42] or student interest groups there's a
[37:44] sports analytics club at nc state that
[37:46] we worked with for a while and that was
[37:48] 50 undergrads who are immediately
[37:51] enthusiastically working on problems
[37:53] with us
[37:55] there's an opportunity to tap into the
[37:56] horsepower and the connectivity that way
[37:59] like participating in the occasional
[38:00] conference is important you can do that
[38:02] as a referee as a speaker or as an
[38:04] attendee
[38:05] um
[38:06] and
[38:08] if you do all of these things well i
[38:09] think the public work can be
[38:12] a constant sort of new ideas
[38:15] and eventually like based on the example
[38:17] new hires and new ways of looking at
[38:19] your own work
[38:21] and just leading you with that last
[38:23] thought that
[38:24] ensembles really do almost always beat
[38:26] individual models and it's the job of
[38:29] people who work in teams to make use of
[38:31] every piece of information they have
[38:34] so
[38:35] with that i will
[38:37] stop here and would be happy to answer
[38:39] any questions you have
[38:44] thank you very much eric
[38:46] um now it's time for questions we um we
[38:50] can take questions from the q and a
[38:52] window if you click the
[38:54] bottom right
[38:56] uh i think on my screen three dots if
[38:58] you click on it there you will see a q
[39:00] and a session
[39:01] so please input your question
[39:03] there
[39:04] and of course panelists you your
[39:07] your feel free to ask just unmute
[39:09] yourself you can ask
[39:17] okay
[39:18] okay so we got one question
[39:21] um
[39:21] how do you determine what parts of the
[39:24] public domain are trustworthy
[39:27] and valuable to use
[39:30] yeah that's so
[39:33] that's a good question i
[39:35] i think it is
[39:37] there's two ways of thinking about it
[39:39] one is
[39:41] on some level
[39:43] everything is valuable even if the
[39:45] research is
[39:46] in some fundamental way just kind of
[39:49] misguided
[39:51] having someone throw stuff out there
[39:53] whether it's right or wrong might get
[39:54] you thinking about something new so
[39:57] spending a little bit of time just
[39:59] reading everything has some value
[40:02] but you do ultimately need to have that
[40:05] intuition for which things are most
[40:08] valuable
[40:09] most well underpinned in terms of the
[40:11] quality of the study and the quality of
[40:13] the data they have
[40:14] and that is
[40:15] like i said in my little introduction i
[40:18] i think that is a skill that you can
[40:20] develop over time
[40:22] for
[40:23] getting a sense for what is most likely
[40:25] to um
[40:27] to sort of hold up under scrutiny and
[40:31] what kind of tests you can use to
[40:32] scrutinize it
[40:38] um oh that question was from uh alex uh
[40:41] harriman now the next question is from
[40:44] darren
[40:45] or shaftness
[40:46] c
[40:47] have you seen
[40:49] a good example of
[40:51] data collection by a club
[40:56] um
[40:58] so
[40:59] by the club
[41:01] there's a caveat there that makes it
[41:02] tricky i think when
[41:07] so
[41:08] when they start by saying
[41:10] we know teens are very siloed and i
[41:12] think it's a good bet that lots of teams
[41:15] have done this and i just didn't know
[41:16] about it but in terms of the things that
[41:18] i actually know about i think most teams
[41:21] when they go to crowdsourced data
[41:25] generally do it through a company and so
[41:28] there are companies that will
[41:30] collect data for you and provide it
[41:33] and most teams i think would not want to
[41:36] get into the business of trying to
[41:37] organize a crowdsourced data collection
[41:40] effort
[41:41] that being said in the public domain
[41:43] there are crowdsourced efforts i
[41:45] actually
[41:46] led one back in 2012 or 13 where
[41:50] we got
[41:51] uh 30 or 50 different people watching
[41:53] games i gave them a template for things
[41:55] we wanted to watch for them some
[41:56] instruction and we assembled
[41:58] a pretty robust data set that let us
[42:01] draw some interesting conclusions
[42:06] next question is from stephen paziale
[42:10] hi eric how do you overcome the
[42:12] challenge of not having a playing career
[42:15] in the nhl
[42:17] we see now in the mlb most presidents
[42:20] have zero playing experience and and the
[42:23] nhl is trending in that direction how
[42:26] have you overcome this barrier and what
[42:29] is the value of having an analytical
[42:31] mind in charge rather than a former
[42:34] player
[42:35] i don't swing the
[42:38] of the bruins
[42:40] yeah
[42:41] i think this is
[42:43] a real
[42:44] um
[42:45] question that
[42:47] there are things that you understand
[42:49] about the game from having seen it from
[42:51] a player's perspective and there is a
[42:54] level of understanding
[42:57] i think whether playing or coaching
[43:00] i think
[43:01] players and coaches understand
[43:04] the systems better than somebody who
[43:06] hasn't played or coached is likely to
[43:08] they understand more about what's going
[43:11] on at any given second and about what
[43:13] each person needs to think about and
[43:15] what the responsibilities are
[43:17] it's a full-time job for a coach to
[43:19] think about all these different wrinkles
[43:20] and what they're going to do
[43:22] and of course
[43:24] it's impossible for me to be as good at
[43:27] it as they are and so they're always
[43:29] going to know more about those things
[43:34] what's important for me to be able to do
[43:37] is
[43:38] communicate with them in a way that they
[43:40] can understand
[43:41] and so
[43:42] i don't have to have
[43:44] as much understanding as they do about
[43:47] exactly the best way to design a
[43:49] breakout scheme
[43:51] but i need to be able to communicate
[43:53] with them and learn from them about why
[43:55] we're doing the things we're doing and
[43:56] what people are asked to do
[43:58] and
[43:59] help them see
[44:01] what information i can collect and how
[44:03] it can help assist what they're doing
[44:06] and so
[44:07] i think there is real value in having
[44:09] that on ice experience or on the bench
[44:12] experience um
[44:14] i
[44:15] don't think it's the only thing that's
[44:17] valuable though and
[44:19] we have a blend of people in our front
[44:21] office we have people who played with
[44:23] people who coached we have people who
[44:25] have only been in management
[44:27] and
[44:27] i think having those different
[44:29] perspectives
[44:30] with
[44:32] an innovative environment a
[44:33] collaborative environment and a
[44:36] communicative environment
[44:38] is what ends up making the group most
[44:40] successful
[44:45] next question is from otto kaufman
[44:48] why do not go to overtime when lose no
[44:52] points and get a point for a lose
[44:59] not quite sure i understand i assume the
[45:01] question here is in the nhl standings
[45:04] they're a little bit weird because
[45:06] teams that lose in overtime still get a
[45:09] point
[45:11] and that dates back to
[45:14] when there were ties in the nhl
[45:16] teams at the end of the game often got
[45:18] very conservative just trying to protect
[45:22] the point they had in their tie
[45:24] and
[45:26] the league wanted to discourage
[45:28] that conservative play
[45:30] and so they move to this model where
[45:33] you don't want the game to end with both
[45:35] teams just not taking any chances trying
[45:37] to protect the point they have
[45:39] and so they added in the overtime loss
[45:41] point to make it so okay you get that
[45:43] point whether you win and lose now go
[45:45] play hard and try and get the extra
[45:47] point for winning
[45:49] so it makes the standings a little bit
[45:51] different from other sports and i know
[45:52] it causes some confusion but
[45:55] there was a reason for introducing it
[46:00] a question from nicholas watts
[46:04] what is your best advice for a graduate
[46:06] student with a background in sports
[46:08] science
[46:09] who wants to further get into the data
[46:12] analytics side of the business
[46:15] i
[46:15] graduate in may thanks
[46:18] yeah so
[46:21] getting into the business is hard like
[46:24] the challenge is if i post a position
[46:27] tomorrow i'm going to have 500 resumes
[46:30] and
[46:32] they won't all be
[46:33] qualified but a lot of them will be and
[46:37] it's hard for me as a hiring manager to
[46:39] figure out if that big pile of resumes
[46:41] who the most talented candidate is who
[46:43] the best fit is
[46:45] and
[46:46] [Music]
[46:47] so the job of the applicant is to find a
[46:50] way to stand out and
[46:52] there are basically two ways that i've
[46:54] seen people be effective at
[46:57] getting
[46:58] a little bit extra attention on their
[47:00] resume
[47:01] one of them is having done work in the
[47:03] public domain and having a portfolio of
[47:06] existing research that the hiring
[47:08] manager can look at and say you know
[47:11] look they did some interesting work i
[47:13] like the way this person thinks
[47:16] um
[47:17] that that's
[47:18] obviously the path i took and
[47:21] i think people often when they're asked
[47:23] how to go about getting into a field end
[47:25] up just describing what worked for them
[47:27] so that's what worked for me i know it's
[47:29] one option
[47:31] i think the other thing that can really
[47:34] help is networking and having
[47:36] internships and other things like that
[47:39] because
[47:40] if you have an internship on your resume
[47:42] saying you worked at this team
[47:44] the first thing i'm gonna do when i get
[47:45] your resume is call my buddy who works
[47:47] for that team and ask what he thinks of
[47:49] you and
[47:50] if he liked you all of a sudden you're
[47:52] on the short list already because i've
[47:54] already got someone telling me no no
[47:56] there's someone who's worth
[47:58] talking to
[47:59] um
[48:00] so
[48:02] i know not everyone's always in a
[48:03] position to be able to take an
[48:04] internship but i think taking every
[48:07] opportunity to network that you can
[48:10] and
[48:11] if you have the ability to do some
[48:12] internships i think it can really help
[48:14] but just making it so that you have
[48:17] those ways on your resume to make it so
[48:19] that
[48:20] somebody who has this big pile of
[48:22] resumes can figure out which ones are
[48:25] the standout ones helps a lot
[48:27] that being said i
[48:30] in my own personal hiring practices i've
[48:34] i guess since i've been with the team
[48:35] i've hired three people
[48:37] and two of the three
[48:39] were people i had never heard of before
[48:41] i posted the job and didn't have any
[48:43] personal references from so it is
[48:45] possible to just have a compelling
[48:48] resume and to interview well and get a
[48:50] job
[48:51] but if you're looking for a leg up and
[48:52] giving yourself the best chance
[48:55] i think either a portfolio of public
[48:57] work or
[48:58] something like an internship
[49:01] are the easiest ways to
[49:03] increase your chances
[49:07] a question from thomas reeves
[49:10] how much information do you collect and
[49:12] analyze regarding the actions and
[49:15] tendencies
[49:16] of the officiating crew
[49:18] for your games
[49:21] um
[49:22] we have some information on that we we
[49:24] do some things with it
[49:28] i think it i think there's been a lot of
[49:30] that in
[49:32] um sports like basketball and
[49:35] baseball
[49:36] where the officials are playing an
[49:38] active hand in every play
[49:41] in hockey for the most part the
[49:43] officials
[49:45] are
[49:46] observing
[49:47] there are only a few penalties called
[49:49] per game and most of them are obvious
[49:52] enough that any ref would have called it
[49:55] and so
[49:56] there are not that many opportunities to
[49:59] try to gain the system by knowing
[50:01] something about the officials
[50:03] but we do still pay attention and make
[50:05] sure that we have whatever information
[50:07] we might be able to get out of it
[50:13] thanks eric
[50:14] uh i think i have covered all the
[50:16] questions i have seen
[50:18] and please um if you if we still have
[50:22] time if you have further questions
[50:23] please
[50:24] enter them in the q and a window
[50:31] it's just a remark i think uh many of
[50:34] the uh sports analysts they they they
[50:36] write blogs right and they probably they
[50:39] put their own analysis out there and
[50:41] then i guess recruiters may find them if
[50:43] their blocks have a
[50:45] big impact
[50:56] so see there's a question about how to
[50:58] show public domain work as a job speaker
[51:01] from wild downlight
[51:06] there's a lot of ways of doing it i
[51:08] think um
[51:09] it depends what your portfolio looks
[51:12] like i think
[51:14] um
[51:15] if you have maintained a blog
[51:18] it's easy to put on your resume
[51:20] like rihanna blog you know did this
[51:24] information you have a couple bullet
[51:25] points on what it is and tell people
[51:26] where to find it
[51:28] um if you haven't if your work is more
[51:31] like
[51:32] things that you've done for classes or
[51:34] for internships or for your own little
[51:36] fund but not publishing in articles
[51:40] then i think you do end up
[51:42] relying on things like a github
[51:44] repository or personal website i think
[51:47] any of these is a reasonable way to give
[51:49] people a viewing into it um it just
[51:52] needs to be something that you can put
[51:54] on a resume and say
[51:55] hey go look at this and you can see more
[51:57] about me
[52:00] and
[52:01] you know
[52:02] as
[52:03] as a hiring manager i can tell you
[52:06] i will almost always go look and see
[52:08] what the person has done
[52:10] and again it's partly because it helps
[52:12] me know more about them as an applicant
[52:14] it also is another one of these ways to
[52:17] see what people are thinking about out
[52:18] there and what information i might be
[52:20] able to make use of
[52:22] um so it for sure it's something i would
[52:25] look at as a hiring manager
[52:28] i often
[52:30] in an interview process with a developer
[52:33] will ask if they have public work that i
[52:34] can look at because
[52:36] um being able to look at their code and
[52:39] see
[52:40] uh what they do and how they go about it
[52:42] and
[52:43] what you know what their strengths and
[52:46] weaknesses are that sort of thing can be
[52:48] hard to assess in an interview
[52:50] environment um
[52:52] and so i i
[52:53] i can't speak for what all hiring
[52:55] managers do but for me personally i love
[52:57] when people give me access to see
[53:00] some of their thought processes some of
[53:02] their coding just give me a view and do
[53:05] what you were like as a researcher
[53:10] yeah there are more questions i'm sorry
[53:12] i missed that
[53:14] a question from taylor
[53:16] caruso do you think getting an advanced
[53:18] degree is necessary to make you stand
[53:21] out as a candidate in the sports
[53:23] industry or is it more experienced
[53:25] connection and research based
[53:29] um
[53:31] it's not necessary i think
[53:33] different team i think there's very big
[53:36] differences across teams
[53:38] so remember i went through that list of
[53:40] 100
[53:41] people who had data adjacent jobs in the
[53:43] nhl
[53:44] and something like 30 of them had a stem
[53:48] degree
[53:49] and something like 20 of them it was an
[53:52] advanced degree
[53:54] so
[53:57] that
[53:58] that's probably not
[54:00] every team having one out of five
[54:02] employees having an advanced degree it's
[54:04] probably
[54:05] you know maybe half the teams have
[54:08] half their employees with advanced
[54:09] degrees and so i think there are
[54:12] teams where it's a real advantage if you
[54:15] have shown more training
[54:17] um
[54:18] i don't think it's required anywhere and
[54:20] i think there are teams where it's not
[54:23] necessarily that big of an advantage
[54:25] either
[54:26] um
[54:27] you know i
[54:30] every hiring manager is going to be
[54:31] different and every role within
[54:34] a team is going to be different and so i
[54:36] i don't think there is a universal
[54:38] answer i think it's going to depend on
[54:40] what kind of problem you want to be
[54:42] solving and
[54:44] where the
[54:45] where it's easiest to acquire the skills
[54:47] to solve that kind of problem
[54:49] and also where it's easiest to
[54:51] demonstrate people that you've acquired
[54:53] those skills
[54:57] a question from carlene markey
[55:00] if most teams go to private data
[55:02] providers will that change
[55:05] with the advent of player puck trading
[55:09] tracking in the nhl
[55:12] um
[55:13] maybe
[55:15] i would guess
[55:19] i guess they're going to be different
[55:20] things from different teams so
[55:22] one of the things that i think is
[55:24] probably pretty natural is to take
[55:26] anything that people have been doing by
[55:28] hand and ask
[55:30] can we get that automatically out of the
[55:32] player and tracking data and for
[55:34] some things the answer might be yes and
[55:37] then it's just a matter of investing
[55:38] resources into identifying those but
[55:41] that's not always that easy
[55:43] and
[55:45] not every team is going to
[55:47] have the time or inclination or ability
[55:49] to do that
[55:51] and then there are some things you might
[55:52] be interested in that you can't get from
[55:54] player tracking data
[55:57] if i want to record
[55:59] how often a defenseman checks over his
[56:01] shoulder to see what's around him as he
[56:03] goes back for a puck
[56:05] that's valuable information about how
[56:08] well he sees the ice because he can't
[56:10] see the ice if you're not looking
[56:13] that we wouldn't have from our tracking
[56:14] data because we just have a point source
[56:16] saying where the player is and not
[56:18] whether his head is turned
[56:21] and so there's information like that
[56:23] where his stick is positioned will not
[56:25] be in the play
[56:26] and
[56:27] maybe you need to know that to assess
[56:29] things and so
[56:31] i think there will still be a lot of
[56:32] things that
[56:35] where
[56:36] observational techniques or video
[56:39] analysis and computer vision techniques
[56:41] still play a role even with puck
[56:43] tracking and player tracking
[56:45] um but i do think they're gonna be some
[56:47] questions that we can answer with that
[56:49] without going to third parties
[56:54] a question from broadway pros
[56:58] i i've read a paper that argues that
[57:01] teams should be putting their goalie way
[57:04] earlier in the third period but are
[57:07] hesitant to take the chance for fear of
[57:11] backlash from fans and players how do
[57:14] you bridge the gap gaps between
[57:17] analytics and the tradition
[57:19] of the sport
[57:20] yep
[57:21] um
[57:24] yeah so i think that's something that
[57:27] people face in every sport um i think
[57:31] there are some places where
[57:34] it's pretty easy to
[57:36] um
[57:38] help people
[57:39] ultimately everybody wants to win
[57:41] coaches want to win more than anything
[57:43] else and
[57:45] fear of backlash
[57:47] might play a role in some cases but i
[57:49] think if they believe it's going to help
[57:51] them win games
[57:52] they're generally going to want to do it
[57:54] the challenge is
[57:56] they've spent their whole life becoming
[57:58] one of the world's leading experts in
[58:00] this and everything they've ever done
[58:02] said this was the way to do it
[58:04] and it can be hard to say hold on i've
[58:06] got some data that says that's wrong and
[58:10] it's not going to be easy for someone
[58:12] who is as expert as they are to
[58:14] immediately drop their opinion and by
[58:16] the way they probably shouldn't more
[58:18] often than not
[58:19] their instinct is going to be right and
[58:21] there's a reason why decades of
[58:23] experience led to that conclusion
[58:26] but
[58:27] in the cases where they are it really
[58:29] comes down to communication and
[58:33] on the goalie pull like the mouth
[58:36] is moderately complicated and it's
[58:39] probably not something that a coach is
[58:41] going to understand easily
[58:43] but
[58:45] if i have a conversation that says
[58:48] yeah no that that intuition that you
[58:50] have that you wait until there's a
[58:51] minute left to pull the goalie was right
[58:54] back when you played because back when
[58:56] you played teams scored five or six or
[58:58] seven goals a game
[58:59] and
[59:00] let's just wait another minute or two we
[59:02] might get one here was the right way to
[59:04] go
[59:06] nowadays there's way fewer goals being
[59:08] scored and so
[59:09] your intuition has to change if you wait
[59:12] a minute you're probably not scoring a
[59:14] goal in that minute you're just wasting
[59:15] a minute of time and so you need to
[59:18] start pulling the goalie early and
[59:19] that's something the coach can say yeah
[59:21] okay i get that
[59:23] and
[59:24] that won't lead them to an answer about
[59:25] how much earlier and you might still
[59:27] need to talk about what the math says to
[59:29] get there but i think having that
[59:31] ability to communicate the reasoning
[59:33] behind what the models are showing and
[59:35] help people get a feel for
[59:38] why this
[59:39] counter-intuitive result actually makes
[59:42] sense and the intuition might be off
[59:44] here
[59:44] is what's really powerful in this kind
[59:46] of situation
[59:49] um thank you eric i think we are getting
[59:51] to the end but let's take just let's
[59:53] just take one more question last
[59:54] question
[59:55] uh this question is from jeremy burden
[59:58] um what types of studies or research do
[60:02] you do for the hurricanes specifically
[60:04] to gain a competitive advantage over
[60:07] other teams from your analytics people
[60:11] yeah i mean
[60:13] part of how we get a competitive
[60:14] advantage is not talking specifically
[60:16] about what we do
[60:19] there's a limit to how much i can answer
[60:20] that but we do
[60:23] we do try to involve
[60:26] the use of data and quantitative
[60:28] information in just about everything we
[60:30] do so
[60:32] it gets incorporated in different ways
[60:34] we do different kinds of studies and
[60:36] provide different kinds of information
[60:39] um
[60:40] partly because you need different
[60:41] information for a question like which
[60:44] draft prospect is the best bet
[60:46] then for
[60:47] what should this player do at this point
[60:49] in time on the ice um those are just
[60:52] fundamentally different kinds of
[60:54] questions that need different kinds of
[60:56] information
[60:57] but also each group works differently
[60:59] and
[61:00] the way that one group
[61:02] might need to see something to
[61:04] understand it and make the best use of
[61:06] it is different from the way another
[61:08] group might need to and so
[61:11] i think there's a really wide variety
[61:13] of approaches in terms of
[61:16] what we look at how we look at it how we
[61:18] present it that's really tailored to who
[61:22] our audience is within the team
[61:26] all right
[61:27] thank you very much eric
