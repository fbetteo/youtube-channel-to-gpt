[09:41] this conference isn't free to run we
[09:43] want to keep it we want to keep it uh
[09:44] inexpensive for the students because
[09:46] this is a student Centric conference so
[09:49] um if you are in a position at a company

[10:08] sponsorship levels but we would like to
[10:10] raise more money so we can do more
[10:11] things with the with the event so if
[10:13] you're in a position to sponsor this we
[10:14] would love to hear from you um and I
[10:16] have a rather big announcement to make
[10:18] the conference next year will be back it

[10:25] hosted next year at Yale University and
[10:28] Brian's going to do all the work
[10:32] work I'll I'll help a little bit all
[10:36] right so anything else junor is that
[10:38] that's basically it Elliot has something
[10:40] yes oh
[10:44] oh just want to do a little expectation
[10:46] setting so part of the prize for the
[10:49] data challenge winners was the
[10:52] opportunity to present at our annual US
[10:55] Olympic and Par Olympic data analytics
[10:56] and Technology Summit in Colorado
[10:58] Springs
[11:00] so at this point I'm committing to
[11:03] paying all the expenses for one member
[11:05] of each winning
[11:06] team um we'll see what else we can do
[11:09] but please keep that in mind the dates
[11:11] are December 4th and 5th I know that
[11:15] many of you are on to like the next
[11:18] steps in your lives and your careers so
[11:20] I know your availability is probably
[11:22] uncertain right now but keep those dates
[11:24] in mind I would love to have at least
[11:26] one member of each team attend and I'll
[11:28] be in touch with you in the future to
[11:30] figure out how that works okay so just
[11:32] keep that in mind thank
[11:39] you go look at the endowments of Duke
[11:41] and Yale they can foot the bill Brian
[11:43] can we send the rest of them I think
[11:45] Yale and Duke can probably find the
[11:47] money to send the rest of you I I'm not
[11:49] committing to the money but Brian is
[11:50] you're committing to the money right
[11:53] [Music]
