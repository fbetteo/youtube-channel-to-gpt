[00:00] sarah is currently manager of analytics
[00:02] and data for the los angeles rams she
[00:04] studied at both jacksonville university
[00:06] and the university of pacific where she
[00:07] pursued a mathematics degree and began
[00:09] to explore ways to combine her love of
[00:11] sports and math including publishing a
[00:13] paper entitled a comparison of academic
[00:16] and athletic performance in the ncaa
[00:18] after holding an internship with the
[00:20] then san diego chargers
[00:21] bayley obtained a master's degree from
[00:23] simon fraser university during her time
[00:26] there she participated in the nba
[00:27] hackathon and was part of the winning
[00:29] team in the hockey grass data sprint
[00:31] hackathon
[00:32] and worked with advisor tim schwartz on
[00:34] baseball research for her master's
[00:35] project
[00:37] after graduating uh bailey joined the
[00:39] rams initially as a sports performance
[00:40] analyst where she worked with athletic
[00:42] trainers and strength staff to analyze
[00:44] workload and optimize performance
[00:47] her role has evolved to include working
[00:49] with all data and departments on the
[00:50] football side including but not limited
[00:52] to analyzing data from the personnel and
[00:54] medical staff and assisting scouting
[00:56] departments to identify key traits and
[00:58] players project players into the nfl and
[01:01] evaluate scouting systems to see what
[01:02] measured variables are most important on
[01:04] the performance side her work looks at
[01:06] various measurements to try to optimize
[01:07] players game day performance and
[01:09] minimize the probability the probability
[01:11] of preventable injury
[01:13] please join me in welcoming sarah
[01:18] thank you uh for that intro and great
[01:20] job i just caught the
[01:22] last uh 20 minutes of that panel and i
[01:25] think it's absolutely incredible that
[01:27] it's all women for one he could have
[01:29] asked me a few years ago and i would
[01:31] have been the only woman on the panel so
[01:33] um
[01:34] that's amazing
[01:36] as the person
[01:38] introduced me so kindly i'm sarah i am
[01:40] the manager of football analytics for
[01:42] the los angeles rams and uh today i
[01:44] really want to talk about sports science
[01:46] and that's kind of how i got started
[01:48] with the rams and where my work
[01:50] initiated and
[01:52] really what what actually just have been
[01:54] released by seth walder is a declaration
[01:56] that 18 out of the 22 teams surveyed did
[01:59] sports science which is a high
[02:00] proportion but it surprised me more that
[02:02] there were four teams that took this
[02:04] survey that were not the point where
[02:05] they needed an analyst necessarily to
[02:08] use their data i do think it's really
[02:10] important side of sport and it's a
[02:12] different way to get in where you have
[02:14] the ability to affect multiple areas
[02:17] just by working with your athletic
[02:19] trainers and your sports science team so
[02:21] it's a very overview brought up we're
[02:23] gonna plot it's gonna be a lot of me
[02:25] talking and uh just talking about the
[02:28] sport and how where how we work together
[02:30] the communication just different things
[02:32] along those lines so
[02:33] really hope you guys enjoy please ask
[02:35] ask questions and i'll get to them at
[02:37] the end
[02:38] um
[02:39] really what i want to talk about is just
[02:41] some of the objectives of sports science
[02:43] how do we use it what kind of importance
[02:45] are we going to get different data
[02:47] sources i'm going to spend a lot of time
[02:48] on the different data that we collect
[02:50] and how they interact and different
[02:52] difficulties and challenges that may
[02:53] arise within those sources and then of
[02:56] course applications how do we apply in
[02:58] all facets of the team to make us a
[03:00] better organization better players
[03:02] better athletes mentally physically
[03:04] and then just looking at some in the
[03:06] future that i see just where it's
[03:08] involved how it's going to go uh
[03:10] different situations like that
[03:12] so we're going to get right into
[03:13] objectives sports science i'm like it's
[03:15] very
[03:16] not different from analytics in general
[03:18] with sport you really just want to
[03:20] provide a unique perspective
[03:22] uh your trainers your strength coaches
[03:24] they can watch players lift they can
[03:26] look at them on the field and say hey we
[03:28] think this guy is explosive we think
[03:30] that he is um accelerating fast but what
[03:33] data and sports science can do is really
[03:35] quantify that and assign some
[03:37] numerical value and say he might look
[03:39] explosive at the beginning but he's
[03:41] actually he's actually not and his power
[03:44] comes from the middle of the route or
[03:46] his power comes from the end of the
[03:47] route the top of the road whatever it
[03:49] may do and you can actually assign a
[03:51] numerical value of stack players against
[03:53] each other and really compare alphas to
[03:55] apples when you get down to it you can
[03:58] also see how significant the change is
[04:00] maybe it's nothing maybe it's miniscule
[04:02] maybe it's actually quite a significant
[04:05] difference between player to player um
[04:07] going with that it's kind of a
[04:09] self-evaluation how well are we
[04:11] evaluating players from our own eyes
[04:13] when we see them when our trainers look
[04:15] at them when our coaches look at them
[04:17] are they getting it right are they
[04:19] seeing what the data is telling us and
[04:22] how can we really just look and kind of
[04:24] validate what they're showing but also
[04:26] maybe invalidate some aspects of it
[04:28] and then again looking at kind of
[04:30] intervention effectiveness when you see
[04:32] a from an athletic training perspective
[04:34] and from the strength coach perspective
[04:36] if you're seeing an imbalance where
[04:38] you're seeing a weakness it's through
[04:39] your nature to fix that you want to
[04:42] adapt and do exercises and stretches to
[04:45] make a player better so how can we use
[04:47] data to show that those changes are
[04:49] working and to show that what we're
[04:51] doing is effectively making a player
[04:53] stronger or faster or better in its area
[04:55] of weakness another thing is a noise
[04:57] reducer from an analytics perspective we
[05:00] have so much data and i'm going to get
[05:01] into it and you're going to hear me talk
[05:03] about it and
[05:05] you'd be surprised at the amount of
[05:06] information that we have coming in on
[05:08] these players and a lot of it is noise
[05:11] we have a lot of
[05:13] data that may be messy and may not be
[05:16] important it may not be important to the
[05:18] specific question that we're asking but
[05:19] could be relevant to something else so
[05:22] from an analytics perspective you can
[05:24] look and you can say okay well these are
[05:26] flagging certain areas of weakness these
[05:28] aren't um how do we
[05:30] look at those outliers how do we remove
[05:32] outliers that are legitimate outliers
[05:34] and how do we remove ones that are
[05:36] actually just maybe the player was tired
[05:37] that day or maybe they their form was
[05:40] off or something along those lines
[05:42] and then of course like anything we want
[05:44] to evolve and we want to improve we want
[05:46] to refine our process become more
[05:48] efficient do the small things good so
[05:51] that we can focus on some of those
[05:52] bigger problems from an analyst
[05:54] perspective that we can like really dive
[05:57] deep and get some of these models built
[05:59] or different methods that we can analyze
[06:01] the data and just really become more
[06:03] efficient as a team so that what we're
[06:05] presenting to
[06:07] our trainers to our coaches is the best
[06:09] and it's the cleanest data that we can
[06:11] get and it's the most informative in a
[06:13] very simple manner
[06:15] uh so first i want to talk about the
[06:17] data sources now there's obviously the
[06:19] obvious ones like gps but what's
[06:21] interesting about gps is that you have
[06:23] your xy data for both games and practice
[06:27] the ngs data that a lot of people will
[06:28] hear about particularly the stuff in the
[06:30] big data bowl we have that in practice
[06:32] as well what's unique about practice
[06:34] with the xy level data is that it's not
[06:37] clean at all it is terrible so you may
[06:40] have
[06:41] four different um periods going on on
[06:43] the same field where you have the
[06:44] defensive line and they're doing pad
[06:47] drills and on the other side you have
[06:48] receivers catching ball and on the other
[06:50] side you have db's doing uh back pedal
[06:53] drills so it's really hard to define a
[06:56] start and stop and define
[06:58] where that soft start occurs for each
[07:00] player and each position um the second
[07:02] thing with gps is you do have the
[07:04] wrapped up summary so at the end of the
[07:06] period at the end of the day you have
[07:08] different
[07:09] variables like your speed your
[07:11] acceleration your distance everything
[07:13] travels it's been fairly smooth and
[07:16] clean to a point where you know you can
[07:18] use that as a high level to analyze the
[07:20] player the second thing that we do have
[07:23] is we have four stacks um we use force x
[07:26] as the technology that you use but what
[07:27] it is it's a force plate that players
[07:29] will jump on
[07:30] measures different force powers times
[07:34] velocities through different movements
[07:36] you can do counter movement jumps which
[07:38] is where you just like a squat jump and
[07:40] you're moving using your hands you can
[07:42] have your hands on your hips you can
[07:43] have loaded and unloaded you can do
[07:46] squat jumps you can do drop jumps you
[07:48] can do anything that you can think of on
[07:50] the plate you can measure these
[07:52] different forces that are coming in
[07:55] um
[07:56] with a personal wellness survey that's
[07:58] just a player checking how is the guy
[07:59] doing how are you feeling um you ask
[08:02] anything from distress
[08:04] hydration sleep perceived exertion
[08:07] soreness where were you sore how sore
[08:09] were you and it's all relative to the
[08:12] players so you have to keep that in mind
[08:13] from a data analyst is that my level of
[08:16] sore my three is not your three and
[08:19] um joey's three is not
[08:22] john's three uh so we really have to be
[08:24] careful that that when you're looking at
[08:26] those kind of things that it's
[08:28] interpretable to someone someone may put
[08:29] a one and they always put zeros and
[08:31] that's like a hey
[08:33] something's up here because he he
[08:35] indicated he was sore
[08:36] um the fourth we have lifting output and
[08:39] this one was something that i was
[08:40] actually really unfamiliar with when i
[08:41] first started and it's pretty cool we
[08:43] use uh kaiser and geminware and there
[08:45] are two different softwares that similar
[08:47] to the four stacks they measure
[08:50] different power displacement rsi and for
[08:53] the gym aware it's attached to the bars
[08:55] and they're little strings little wires
[08:57] attached so when you lift the bar up
[08:59] you're calculating your velocity you're
[09:01] collecting your depth you're looking at
[09:03] different exercises within that so that
[09:05] can be a bench press that can be a squat
[09:08] that can
[09:09] be a different bar you can really
[09:10] connect to any any type of equipment as
[09:13] long as it's connected right and um
[09:16] equalized right uh
[09:18] then the last thing we have is enough
[09:20] last for philosophical injury database
[09:22] that we have this is
[09:24] very much what you think it is when a
[09:25] player gets injured recording when where
[09:29] how was it on a drill was it just random
[09:31] was it in a game what type of injury was
[09:33] it was it soft tissue was it a
[09:35] concussion base is it a break um just
[09:38] different details that the trainer finds
[09:40] relevant that we take in we digest and
[09:43] we store um
[09:44] and then we have our weigh-ins that
[09:46] occurs whenever the nutritionist wants
[09:49] so you want a weekly weigh-in you want a
[09:51] post-practice way and you want to see
[09:53] how much water was lost and then every
[09:55] once in a while they'll do body pumps
[09:57] let's look at what's inside so you might
[09:59] be 250 now and you were to 75 at the
[10:02] start of the season what was lost was it
[10:04] water weight was it fat how's your
[10:05] muscle mass distributed through your
[10:07] body what kind of bone density are we
[10:09] looking at just various information that
[10:12] you might not see just from a regular
[10:14] scale way
[10:16] and finally we do have some performance
[10:18] uh college data and this is obviously
[10:20] very limited because we don't work with
[10:22] the colleges but
[10:24] what we do have is different medical
[10:26] grades when our uh when our where our
[10:28] trainers are going rocks going and they
[10:30] grade a guy based on his injury history
[10:32] and then uh give him a projected grade
[10:35] like hey he's only had one injury he's
[10:37] great or he's to have ten and we don't
[10:40] want him um looking at different
[10:42] strength grades as well our strength and
[10:44] conditioning coaches will go in and look
[10:46] at his body type is he able to put on
[10:48] muscle based on how he looks is he going
[10:51] to struggle is his field not meant for
[10:53] more weight should he lose weight and
[10:55] he'll be good just various things like
[10:57] that and then also have the odd speed
[11:00] data that you might get
[11:02] um
[11:02] so how i want to talk about i want to
[11:04] continue to talk about data and talk
[11:06] about the networks within data i really
[11:08] think sports science is a cool thing
[11:10] because i i like to view it as a two
[11:12] networks you have your data network any
[11:13] other people network the people that you
[11:15] interact with and then they also
[11:17] interact together so for me it's a fun
[11:20] little challenge to see
[11:21] how these sources can communicate and
[11:24] how we can use them to
[11:26] validate invalidate each other and work
[11:28] together so that we're all on the same
[11:30] page essentially whether it's with data
[11:32] whether it's a network so i want to
[11:34] first talk about the data networks
[11:36] we have all this information now so how
[11:39] do we use it the biggest thing with data
[11:41] is we want to try and get a complete
[11:42] picture of our athlete so we really want
[11:45] to make sure that what we're using is
[11:48] the best representative of how an
[11:49] athlete might feel on that day what they
[11:52] what their workload look like for the
[11:53] week for the day for the month whatever
[11:55] the time frame is that we're doing and
[11:57] the first thing we need to do is we need
[11:59] to clean the data and it really just
[12:00] depends on the level that you're looking
[12:02] at so for example with those fourth
[12:04] place
[12:05] certain job data can be really sensitive
[12:08] um players are able to manipulate it
[12:11] based on like just a slight distribution
[12:13] in their weight you have to be very
[12:14] careful when they're jumping to have a
[12:16] trainer they're watching their form to
[12:18] ensure
[12:19] now data can also be used to play that
[12:21] we can say hey
[12:22] something's up with this guy's data so
[12:25] let's go back let's look at his job that
[12:27] we filmed and let's see how it looked
[12:29] did it look okay did he step on the
[12:31] scale long and his mass wasn't equal you
[12:34] step on you have to wait each other to
[12:36] calculate force to calculate power so
[12:38] when you step on was there something
[12:41] going on where his weight was uh was
[12:43] undistributed he actually was 75 percent
[12:45] on his left leg and he didn't stay still
[12:47] essentially
[12:48] um
[12:49] it's it's pretty uh interesting when you
[12:51] do clean the data you can start getting
[12:53] into these automatic processes where we
[12:55] can flag players immediately and say hey
[12:58] something's wrong don't know whether
[13:00] it's a data issue or whether it's a
[13:02] visible form issue but let's look at
[13:04] this and really it's something that has
[13:06] to be player specific because what's a
[13:08] slight deviation for me again that's
[13:11] going to be different for our players
[13:12] it's going to be different within
[13:13] positions and
[13:15] this can be a little bit challenging as
[13:17] you get into some of the newer guys and
[13:19] players that maybe don't necessarily
[13:21] jump as often that you don't have a lot
[13:24] of data so you do have a lot of noise in
[13:26] that information but really it's just
[13:29] being adaptable learning how to deal
[13:31] with it and figuring out what can you do
[13:33] with the information that you're given
[13:35] um
[13:36] we also have so you want to merge and
[13:38] combine your data what does that mean we
[13:40] have on a field data and you have off
[13:42] field data on field obviously being gps
[13:45] and off field being kind of those jumps
[13:47] those wellnesses and the four-step sort
[13:50] of situation so how do we combine those
[13:53] to merge them to a single data source um
[13:56] one of the biggest things that is very
[13:58] hard is looking at like
[14:00] what is the single data source and what
[14:02] is our date day bringing how do we how
[14:04] do we combine so we're looking at um the
[14:07] right time frame when we're seeing a
[14:09] player on a certain day or in a certain
[14:11] week
[14:12] we also have different technologies that
[14:14] we use during different times of the
[14:16] year so for example if we're using if
[14:18] we're down in irvine and we're at
[14:19] training camp we're not bringing our
[14:21] 30-foot poles to irvine we're not
[14:23] bringing those to
[14:25] london we do across the sea or when we
[14:27] stay in baltimore for a week
[14:29] so we're using polar which is a gps the
[14:32] zebra is rfid polar's gps slide
[14:35] deviation shouldn't be too big but you
[14:37] do have to consider the different
[14:39] variables that they're measuring
[14:41] acceleration might be defined
[14:42] differently high speed yards can be
[14:44] defined differently with those so as an
[14:46] analyst and working with your data
[14:48] architect it's really important that you
[14:50] define what those what those variables
[14:53] mean so that when you are merging to
[14:54] that single database that when you see
[14:56] high speed yards it doesn't matter
[14:58] whether it's polar or zebra we know that
[15:01] it's um it's going to be the same
[15:03] definition
[15:04] uh the second thing is with the smartest
[15:06] science spartans are typically used in
[15:08] the combine so how can we collect
[15:10] information from that that we're given
[15:12] and use it within our own team so we
[15:14] have all these jumps on our players it
[15:16] would be a shame to not be able to
[15:18] compare some of that idea that we're
[15:20] given to our own force play it's not a
[15:23] different technology of course but to be
[15:25] able to minimize some of those
[15:27] differences and figure out what's
[15:28] similar and actually stack some of these
[15:30] guys up is really important um
[15:34] one of the things that i did when i
[15:35] first came in here is change the whole
[15:37] testing framework um so i come in and
[15:40] they're jumping guys on mondays and
[15:41] wednesdays and they're the same position
[15:44] or one guy will jump on a monday one
[15:45] weekend wednesday the next week and for
[15:48] me uh coming from you know an area where
[15:51] you're exposed to very clean date in
[15:53] school um
[15:55] everyone knows that the data sets are
[15:57] given are fairly perfect so when you're
[16:00] going into the real export world and
[16:03] real data where it's extremely messy
[16:06] you have to uh you have to be careful
[16:09] and you have to make sure that you can
[16:11] control as much as you can control
[16:13] because
[16:14] it's chaos and it really is never going
[16:17] to be perfect for that beautiful model
[16:19] that you want to run and trust me i want
[16:21] it to be but it's just not ever going to
[16:23] get there so one of the first things i
[16:25] did was let's just ensure that we're
[16:27] controlling all that we can so what do
[16:29] we want to get out of these jumps first
[16:31] of all i'm just going to start with that
[16:32] example do we want to know how well
[16:34] they're recovering from the game do we
[16:36] want to know if they're recovered after
[16:39] tuesday when they've had their off day
[16:41] those are two different questions if you
[16:42] want to know how well they've recovered
[16:44] let's jump them on a monday if we want
[16:46] to know if they're in a fresh state by
[16:48] wednesday then let's jump on wednesday
[16:50] whatever it is that's a question that we
[16:52] have to ask and work together but let's
[16:55] keep it consistent so that we know that
[16:57] hey it doesn't matter what question
[17:00] we're asking but we were consistent in
[17:02] the way when we got it um the second
[17:04] time it's just
[17:05] like looking at a range kind of what i
[17:08] alluded to if you're trying to define
[17:10] different workloads different
[17:12] measurements for a player what is your
[17:14] range you may have you want to look at a
[17:16] guy on thursday and he filled out his
[17:18] personal wellness wednesday he jumped on
[17:21] monday so how far back do you need to go
[17:24] to look at his workload for thursday do
[17:26] we consider that wellness on wednesday
[17:29] do we consider the jumps for monday or
[17:31] do we just strictly look at gps daily
[17:34] what if we want the full picture in that
[17:35] day we want the full week then how much
[17:38] do we wait wednesday's practice how much
[17:40] do we wait monday's walk through
[17:41] different questions like that that
[17:43] really there's not necessarily a right
[17:45] answer
[17:46] it again goes through with working with
[17:49] your trainers and figuring out how we
[17:50] best put this data in the most usable
[17:53] way that you can have
[17:56] the other thing is just you just want to
[17:59] be consistent but then also be aware be
[18:02] aware that life changes um when you're
[18:04] looking at
[18:05] different practices or different games
[18:08] of the week for example we just came off
[18:09] of a short week thursday so now we're
[18:12] looking at building that athlete profile
[18:15] and flagging these guys a wednesday no
[18:17] longer wednesday practice sorry
[18:20] again
[18:22] wednesday is no longer a wednesday
[18:23] practice because we play on thursday so
[18:25] if you're trying to flag the guy and if
[18:27] i is the data science haven't adjusted
[18:29] my um my thresholds to make sure that
[18:32] we're not flagging guys then that's on
[18:34] me that's a problem that it's going to
[18:36] send out all these emails saying like
[18:38] hey why are we practicing today why are
[18:40] we so low on a wednesday and it's like
[18:42] well sarah come on we have a thursday
[18:44] game you have to pay attention um so for
[18:46] me that's one of those things that you
[18:47] do have to consider the nuances and make
[18:49] sure that you're communicating with
[18:51] everyone so that you understand when
[18:53] those things change if a coach switches
[18:55] the practice that can happen you need to
[18:57] be in the loop so that you can adjust
[18:59] everything and be on the fly and be
[19:02] adaptable
[19:03] uh
[19:04] ultimately
[19:05] what we want to do is just fill in some
[19:07] missing pieces right so if we're having
[19:10] um missing piece from zebras we don't
[19:12] necessarily know power we know
[19:14] acceleration maybe we can get how
[19:16] powerful they are
[19:18] from four stacks maybe we can get it
[19:20] from gym aware from their different um
[19:22] outlifting output for the day uh how do
[19:25] each piece fit together how can we
[19:28] validate different types of technologies
[19:30] for example if we see that a player is
[19:32] slow on the field and we see that they
[19:35] were lifting quite slow velocity as well
[19:38] at the same weight then maybe that's an
[19:40] indicator that they they're moving slow
[19:42] that day and can we see that now again
[19:44] like maybe some sources show it better
[19:46] maybe their lifting is showing that
[19:48] they're moving slow but their zebras is
[19:50] going at a constant speed or they're
[19:52] improving so as an analyst we come in
[19:55] and we say well what what what's a
[19:57] better picture of it like what is the
[19:59] better indicator an indicator for what
[20:01] what do we want to optimize
[20:03] um
[20:04] we're looking at the different
[20:05] deficiencies like
[20:07] is one more reliable is one better um
[20:09] really just digging into the data in
[20:11] there again there's so much data so that
[20:13] when it comes to the thing we only get
[20:15] to show them the little pieces we may
[20:17] have looked at the whole picture but we
[20:18] show them the relevant ones to the
[20:21] questions that we're trying to ask
[20:23] uh so the second network that i want to
[20:25] talk about although i've talked your ear
[20:27] off about data is the people network and
[20:29] this is probably one of the coolest
[20:31] things with sports science and i think
[20:33] one of the things that people don't
[20:34] necessarily appreciate or maybe they
[20:36] don't know is when you're working with
[20:38] the athletic trainers when you're
[20:40] working with the strength coaches you
[20:41] are working with every single person in
[20:44] the organization i don't think that
[20:46] there's a role as an analyst where you
[20:49] get that where you have that opportunity
[20:52] to have a good relationship to have
[20:54] talking relationships to present your
[20:57] work to literally every group on the
[20:59] football side
[21:00] um you have
[21:02] really uh
[21:04] athletic trainers which is obviously
[21:05] your primary work but then you also talk
[21:08] to your strength and your conditioning
[21:09] coaches and then they work together your
[21:11] nutritionist and your player engagement
[21:14] director who all work together so these
[21:16] three people make up the performance
[21:18] team and you're part of the performance
[21:20] team um
[21:24] did it just go black
[21:26] there we go sorry
[21:28] uh
[21:29] okay that's sorry yes so you're those
[21:31] three people that go um through a
[21:32] performance team
[21:34] and your performance team works together
[21:36] as well
[21:36] none of the sports science department
[21:39] will ever be effective it will not kick
[21:41] off if you don't have good relationships
[21:43] if you don't communicate if you've ever
[21:45] heard me speak about anything or how to
[21:47] break in i always stress communication
[21:50] and it was from sports science but i
[21:52] learned this because not only do i have
[21:54] to be able to seek injuries with our
[21:56] athletic trainers i have to be able to
[21:57] speak lifting output with our strength
[21:59] and conditioning coaches nutrition and
[22:01] mental health with our player
[22:03] engagements and nutrition i also have to
[22:06] convert that into languages for coaches
[22:08] but maybe i don't directly say it to the
[22:10] coaches but this is what like hey
[22:12] we're being pulled because of
[22:14] that we're going to pull joe because of
[22:16] this and that's like
[22:17] you have to be able to speak the
[22:19] language so you can say it in a
[22:20] different way and then go to personnel
[22:22] and also say that let's rank these guys
[22:25] these are our best
[22:27] players on the team ones our best travel
[22:29] because whatever the question may be you
[22:31] really do have to learn to communicate
[22:32] with all of these groups and you get a
[22:35] chance to be exposed to all their
[22:37] vocabulary really the biggest thing that
[22:39] you want to see is what are they asking
[22:41] that's the hardest part with the people
[22:43] network is kind of detangling what
[22:45] someone is asking they can come with you
[22:47] to data and say hey sir i really want to
[22:49] figure this out and you have to kind of
[22:51] get to the root cause of what they want
[22:53] what what is the purpose of their
[22:55] question what do they want to use it for
[22:57] is it something that they can control is
[22:58] it just a monitoring thing um
[23:01] what sort of
[23:02] way can we take the data did they pull
[23:05] the right data maybe it's the wrong data
[23:06] i can think of an example last week
[23:08] where you know one of our athletic
[23:10] trainers came to me with like four very
[23:12] specific variables and said hey we want
[23:14] to use these and establish some
[23:16] positional threshold and i said okay
[23:19] let's let's take a look and so i look at
[23:21] these uh pieces of information and one
[23:24] of them
[23:25] is extremely variable it is i'm talking
[23:27] it was measured in military because i'm
[23:29] talking it was two and a half seconds to
[23:31] 200 milliseconds for one guy in one
[23:34] position over
[23:36] nine weeks and i was like maybe this
[23:39] isn't the best variable so i go
[23:41] figure out what do you want from this
[23:43] what are you trying to show what do you
[23:44] want to build a positional profile for
[23:47] and how can we look at other data and
[23:49] maybe pick a more consistent one a more
[23:52] well-distributed uh kind of variable and
[23:55] go back to them not only questions but
[23:58] also some solutions because if you're
[24:00] only coming with questions and no
[24:01] solutions you're probably just going to
[24:03] get more noise coming back at you um
[24:07] then so it just takes a lot of
[24:09] interpretation but it is fun like for
[24:12] especially for data scientists like
[24:14] you're already solving the data issue
[24:15] and then you're going to solve a people
[24:17] issue so you really get to hit these two
[24:18] different groups that um that challenge
[24:21] you in ways that maybe you're not
[24:22] exposed to and for me i like that i like
[24:25] being challenged in different situations
[24:27] so i think it's a lot of fun um all
[24:30] right so i'm gonna break down what we do
[24:32] within these networks the first is
[24:34] obviously athletic trainers so finally
[24:36] the root of the talk is how do we work
[24:39] with them what do we do um
[24:41] we work directly with you know our vp of
[24:44] sports science our director of athletic
[24:46] training our managers of athletic
[24:48] training and then of course our trainers
[24:50] um you get to work with every single one
[24:51] of them
[24:52] major you can really
[24:54] look down to four different goals that
[24:56] we're trying to accomplish the first is
[24:59] to minimize the risk well how do we
[25:01] define risk that's a big if in football
[25:03] football is a naturally aggressive score
[25:06] you cannot prevent concussions you
[25:07] cannot prevent a player from getting hit
[25:09] they're gonna get hit you get hit hard
[25:11] enough and you snap your bone that's the
[25:14] game that's how it works so how do we
[25:16] kind of minimize some of the risk
[25:19] involved with those soft tissues
[25:21] how do we look at things that aren't
[25:23] necessarily
[25:25] preventable but you can optimize a
[25:27] player so that the probability of that
[25:30] injury occurring is minimized um they're
[25:33] hard to predict i mean the first thing
[25:35] that comes with it it comes with these
[25:36] challenges is sample test you only have
[25:38] your team yes you have to leave data
[25:40] within a game of what a player's fur but
[25:43] i can guarantee that a player um for a
[25:46] soft tissue injury if they're hurt in
[25:47] the game that that didn't occur because
[25:49] of the workload from the game i can
[25:51] almost guarantee that that's that's
[25:52] something that occurred during the week
[25:54] or during the month where they've
[25:56] they've hit some threshold where it
[25:58] doesn't happen so you're minimized to
[26:00] your own own team minimize to a certain
[26:02] type of injury and then
[26:04] you know what
[26:05] what do we have that on that players in
[26:08] a new player um we were very lucky with
[26:10] the ram sonic on wood we have low soft
[26:13] tissue injuries so we don't have a big
[26:16] injury database for those predictable uh
[26:19] i don't like to use that word but
[26:21] predictable injuries that some teams may
[26:23] which is great it's a great problem to
[26:25] have so you kind of have to work with
[26:27] all these small sample solutions that
[26:30] aren't necessarily ideal and it's a very
[26:33] wide range of things that you're going
[26:34] to look at of confidence intervals that
[26:37] you're going to establish um you also
[26:39] have to look at how do you minimize risk
[26:41] with things that you can control uh not
[26:44] a lot that you can control from a from a
[26:46] practice from a game standpoint you know
[26:48] if coach says you're running advanced
[26:50] you're running this but how we control
[26:53] what they're doing for rehab how do we
[26:54] take the time that we have with these
[26:56] athletes and make sure that they're
[26:59] able to implement change from a training
[27:01] perspective and then from a data
[27:03] perspective how do we measure that
[27:05] change and how do we measure those
[27:07] things that we do have our hands on
[27:09] um the second is to monitor workload
[27:13] and workload is more about identifying
[27:15] outliers um you can have
[27:17] you know what i was talking about before
[27:19] with all the data sources you have the
[27:21] amount that they're running you have
[27:23] acceleration speed you have different
[27:26] strength outputs but how do we mod how
[27:28] do we monitor that workload and kind of
[27:31] be able to get very quick information
[27:34] when needed so for example if we would
[27:36] practice wednesday we want to make sure
[27:38] there are certain guys that are close to
[27:40] their weekly workload that we know
[27:42] before practice so that our trainers are
[27:44] on the field and they're saying hey
[27:47] like hey coach this guy's limited
[27:49] because he's he's feeling it this week
[27:51] and we need to go we need to cut him
[27:52] back or this is a veteran's day off
[27:55] because he's at his workload and how do
[27:57] we
[27:58] communicate that and show them in a very
[28:00] simple manner why that's important now
[28:03] for us again like with the injuries we
[28:04] improve the concept which is huge um but
[28:07] it is still something that you do have
[28:09] to work on and it's not necessarily
[28:11] you're not necessarily the good guy when
[28:12] you say hey aaron donald is nearing his
[28:15] threshold what's happening like maybe we
[28:18] need to consider
[28:20] limiting him today not not the greatest
[28:22] not the favorite person of that day but
[28:24] uh
[28:25] like it's a it's a very it's very fun to
[28:28] to figure out and establish those
[28:30] workloads and what's interesting about
[28:32] it is
[28:32] football is so cool this is what i love
[28:34] about it from any data perspective is
[28:37] that each position is unique you can
[28:39] look at each position also the separate
[28:41] sport and what they need from my
[28:43] workload perfect like from a workload so
[28:45] if you're a d-line and you want more
[28:47] power base you don't need to experience
[28:49] yourself as much in terms of distance
[28:51] and speed
[28:52] now if you're a wide out you can even
[28:54] have two positions there you go spot
[28:56] receiver are you on the edges what kind
[28:58] of boundaries do we establish for each
[29:00] of those positions and even as a player
[29:03] some players can handle work more than
[29:05] other players can so it really becomes a
[29:07] unique problem from a data analyst and
[29:09] from an athletic trainer and how do you
[29:11] define these workloads and how do you
[29:13] get specific so that each individual
[29:15] player is getting their own um image
[29:18] they're getting their own kind of script
[29:20] and their own portfolio as to who they
[29:23] are and they're an individual and we're
[29:25] treating them as such so that they can
[29:26] feel like hey this is actually taking me
[29:29] into consideration
[29:30] um
[29:31] goes with monitoring workload is those
[29:33] personal wellness surveys you would be
[29:35] surprised at the amount of good feedback
[29:37] that we get back when we actually use
[29:38] them and if they flag something when the
[29:41] athletic trainers go and they can talk
[29:43] to them like hey how are you feeling not
[29:45] even bringing up the wellness but to get
[29:48] compliance and to show that we're
[29:50] actually looking at this data and it's
[29:51] important it's really a key kind of
[29:53] undervalued different perspective
[29:57] um third thing is optimizing player
[29:59] availability so you've looked at you
[30:00] minimize the risk you've monitored the
[30:03] workload now how do you make them the
[30:04] best that they can be how to how do we
[30:07] make sure that on game day we're
[30:09] performing to the best of their love
[30:11] their knowledge how do we get their
[30:13] speed their acceleration all into
[30:15] account is there an imbalance in their
[30:17] in their
[30:18] in their workload as a one player only
[30:21] cutting left in
[30:23] practice and so his left side is feeling
[30:25] sore maybe we need to either do more to
[30:28] rehab that during the week and and or
[30:31] maybe we need to lift um on the right
[30:33] side differently and that's what the
[30:35] data can tell you you might see it from
[30:37] a field i kind of have an intuition but
[30:39] if i'm telling you right now like hey
[30:42] cop only broke left
[30:44] this practice like he's gonna he he
[30:46] might be sore on there and that's kind
[30:47] of something that's like oh shoot and
[30:49] it's not necessarily okay we're going to
[30:51] cut him we're not going to tell him to
[30:52] or we're going to stop him we're not
[30:54] going to tell him to do that anymore
[30:56] it's just like let's take preventative
[30:57] measures from an athletic training
[30:58] perspective where we know that your
[31:00] body's been strained on that side
[31:02] because of the data because of the
[31:03] information that we've given them that
[31:05] we can now be proactive and sort of take
[31:08] that and say like what's the worst you
[31:10] want to massage cool let's do that let's
[31:13] let's loosen you up um
[31:15] getting those alert when something is up
[31:17] is really key establishing email alerts
[31:19] right after practice right when you
[31:21] finish your survey giving players
[31:23] instant feedback when they finish their
[31:25] survey if something is off and you can
[31:27] see an alert like hey are you hydrated
[31:29] today because you lifted it too for
[31:31] hydration go to the water station kind
[31:33] of giving them that that instant
[31:35] feedback so that they know like oh shoot
[31:38] maybe i am thirsty i did just put that
[31:40] so let's go get you some electrolytes
[31:42] let's let's have those kind of proactive
[31:44] things to again prevent it before it
[31:46] happens we don't we don't want to react
[31:49] when an injury occurs we want to do the
[31:51] best that we can to make sure that we're
[31:53] minimizing that um
[31:56] and then you can also look at like where
[31:57] are they getting fatigued a certain time
[31:59] during practice a certain time during uh
[32:03] during the game where a player loses his
[32:05] ability to change direction as
[32:07] efficiently when a player loses speed
[32:09] where pay releases acceleration is that
[32:11] important for that game is for that
[32:13] position how can we kind of break it
[32:15] down on the sports science side and
[32:17] presented two coaches or two personal
[32:20] groups where you're saying hey this is
[32:22] what we found out
[32:24] um
[32:26] i think that's the mailman
[32:29] the third thing is just to return an
[32:31] investment you're spending time you're
[32:33] sending energy and you're spending money
[32:34] on these players and we want to optimize
[32:36] their success because we want to not
[32:38] only return our investment but return
[32:40] their investment they're putting just
[32:42] less time energy and effort into making
[32:44] sure that their bodies and their play is
[32:46] optimized and we want to put them from
[32:49] an analytics perspective from athletic
[32:51] trainers from a performance we want to
[32:52] put them in the best position to succeed
[32:54] we want to make sure we highlight their
[32:56] strengths and we improve their
[32:57] weaknesses um
[32:59] so i think that that's something that
[33:01] you don't necessarily think about your
[33:03] treat these are athletes but these are
[33:04] people so let's make sure that we value
[33:07] what's important to them and make them
[33:08] the healthiest and even from a data
[33:10] perspective when you don't necessarily
[33:11] interact with the players like that like
[33:13] that's your goal and you have to keep
[33:15] that in the back of your mind
[33:17] um second thing was this was strength
[33:18] and conditioning coaches it's very
[33:20] similar to athletic trainers except
[33:21] maybe the goal is a little bit different
[33:23] a lot of the times it really just
[33:25] depends on the time of year for a
[33:27] trainer you might want to just look at
[33:29] tracking progress
[33:31] during
[33:32] some of the in-season stuff if you're an
[33:34] in-season it's very hard to adapt and
[33:37] change exercises because you are on a
[33:40] very strict schedule and you don't want
[33:41] to introduce a foreign exercise that may
[33:45] strain the body that may hurt a player
[33:48] uh in a way that we don't need them to
[33:49] before games now when you're an ota is
[33:52] in the middle of may and players come in
[33:54] and they you know they might have big
[33:56] force or velocity weaknesses maybe they
[33:58] don't maybe they're great you can
[33:59] actually be proactive and sort of
[34:01] implement some exercises that challenge
[34:04] their body that that are promote that
[34:06] are used to get growth and we can see
[34:08] like hey let's let's see how well um
[34:10] that's that's working
[34:12] and how well we're progressing um it's
[34:14] really fun in the off season to have
[34:16] that flexibility because you can maybe
[34:18] uh do a little bit more experiments with
[34:20] players within their weaknesses within
[34:22] their strengths to sort of see what's
[34:25] becoming more effective and how we
[34:27] bucket players into what they need um
[34:30] when you identify weaknesses you're not
[34:31] only identifying weaknesses from a
[34:33] lifting standpoint you're identifying
[34:35] sideways and says if you're going and
[34:37] you're lifting and really you can maybe
[34:39] not see that you're compensating but
[34:41] maybe from your data you're seeing that
[34:43] you're lifting really heavily on your
[34:45] left side so you're getting through the
[34:47] movement and it looks good from an
[34:48] overall perspective but the data's
[34:50] telling you that you're only using your
[34:52] left side so maybe that right side is
[34:54] weak unless let's look at that and let's
[34:56] see reasons why it could be weak and how
[34:58] can the strength coaches do that and
[35:00] that's obviously all of them but it's
[35:02] really good as an analyst to kind of
[35:04] communicate all that and see hey this is
[35:06] what this is what's important
[35:09] um
[35:10] really again as i kind of said in season
[35:13] you want to maintain so you want to make
[35:15] sure by the time a player
[35:16] goes into into their season that they're
[35:19] maintaining their strength and that
[35:21] they're not getting worse uh at anything
[35:23] and so from a data perspective you
[35:26] really have to keep eyes on that and
[35:27] make sure like hey we saw a one percent
[35:30] decrease this week maybe that's not
[35:31] significant but we've been seeing it
[35:33] steadily for like four weeks so now
[35:35] we're at a net four percent decrease we
[35:38] maybe want to if we're in the first
[35:39] quarter of the season now like that's
[35:41] not a good sign we want to get eyes on
[35:42] the sky what's happening
[35:44] why are we seeing that
[35:46] um the second thing is how do we
[35:49] and so how do we identify this this
[35:51] weakness will you know we can
[35:53] we can get that data and we can see the
[35:55] left and right deficiencies and we can
[35:57] see overall power and force but then
[36:00] it's a lot of kind of
[36:02] uh causal
[36:03] data because we can't really do tests if
[36:06] a player is weak and we intervene we
[36:09] can't say we can't say these two players
[36:11] are the same weakness and we're going to
[36:13] treat one with nothing and we're going
[36:15] to treat the other by actually being
[36:17] proactive and doing that you can't do
[36:18] that in sports so you really do have to
[36:21] kind of take the data as it comes do a
[36:23] lot of different um
[36:25] methods to look at it and not really
[36:27] treating it as an experimenting and
[36:29] treating it as a non-traditional kind of
[36:31] analyst
[36:33] analytics um second thing is a lot of
[36:35] unsupervised learning you're not
[36:37] necessarily trying to optimize anything
[36:38] there's not there's not a dependent
[36:40] variable there's not um something that
[36:42] you're trying to
[36:44] uh predict what you're really trying to
[36:46] do is sort of identify those different
[36:48] clusters those like hey these are four
[36:51] skies these are our velocity guys these
[36:53] guys don't fit in anywhere and do we
[36:55] want them to be more
[36:57] um
[36:58] more fuzzy classroom where it's like
[36:59] they're kind of in between is that is
[37:01] that our goal is that the end where we
[37:04] see both a mix of force and velocity
[37:06] base again
[37:08] from the question and it depends on the
[37:10] player and the position
[37:13] um the third thing with the last in the
[37:16] performance team is the nutrition and
[37:18] player engagement um
[37:20] one thing that's really kind of fun with
[37:22] the nutritionist is just looking at the
[37:23] player weights um seeing
[37:26] when a player is heavier are they moving
[37:28] more efficiently are they moving less
[37:30] efficiently are they more powerful what
[37:32] can they do with that extra weight
[37:34] conversely when a player is lighter how
[37:36] much force are they losing how what are
[37:38] we
[37:39] what are we what's the trade-off between
[37:41] the force loss and the velocity at
[37:43] various weights um it's also
[37:45] communicating with your
[37:47] nutritionist as to what the workload was
[37:49] again that goes from a data thing was
[37:51] just
[37:51] keeping everything super concise and
[37:54] informative so you can send an email at
[37:56] the end of practice so you can send the
[37:58] instant text whatever it is that your
[38:00] source the communication where it's like
[38:02] this is what the players did this day
[38:04] and they can determine as a nutritionist
[38:06] how much they need to refuel their body
[38:08] um what did they sweat
[38:10] what calories do they need to burn
[38:12] different things like that that maybe um
[38:15] you know that really show a player that
[38:17] the nutritionist is the scene that we're
[38:19] listing that everyone's kind of watching
[38:20] them and it just refuels and helps an
[38:23] athlete stay healthy and the second is
[38:25] the stress and mental flag it again goes
[38:27] with that personal wellness the player
[38:29] indicates that they're stressed and
[38:31] maybe it's maybe it's an on-field thing
[38:33] we know that they're not getting as many
[38:35] reps as they like but maybe something's
[38:37] happening off the field and
[38:38] communicating that and sending those
[38:40] alerts very discreetly to our player
[38:42] engagement coordinator so he just come
[38:43] and have a conversation how are you
[38:45] feeling what's up what's happening it's
[38:47] really it's really a cool perspective
[38:50] because you are like
[38:52] all communicating about these players
[38:55] and you're all on the same page you all
[38:56] know what's going on and it's just
[38:58] having those people that are trusted
[39:01] that can go target them in their area of
[39:03] specialty and it all stems from that
[39:05] data being sent out so they say export
[39:08] science and i get excited about it it's
[39:10] because like you were you were the brain
[39:12] of some of this organization and it
[39:15] takes all of these pieces working
[39:17] together and being really
[39:20] not open to the data i mean being
[39:22] efficient and consistent with how
[39:24] they're measuring and trusting you as
[39:25] your analysts that like hey they got
[39:28] that data side because we we want to
[39:30] show that these players um again we're
[39:33] all community we're all one voice is our
[39:35] goal it's kind of cliche there's a lot
[39:37] of questions statements but it's true
[39:39] and that it's just effective
[39:40] communication to keep these guys healthy
[39:43] and second to last is coaches this is
[39:45] where the buy-in happens this is where
[39:48] that voice and that communication in
[39:50] those three departments three um kind of
[39:52] stuff group then yourself within the
[39:54] performance staff needs to work because
[39:56] we need to be able to communicate with
[39:58] coaches that like that this guy is
[40:00] feeling stressed or this guy is reaching
[40:03] his threshold and so
[40:05] the coaches have to respect the work
[40:07] that's being done within the group to
[40:10] actually say like okay that's fine we'll
[40:12] limit them to the snap count or we will
[40:15] watch out for kind of certain like
[40:17] distances that have traveled or we
[40:20] will let a veteran stay off um so from
[40:23] us it really is important that we're all
[40:25] on the same page so that we can
[40:27] communicate that clearly sometimes
[40:29] coaches will even ask me and i don't
[40:31] necessarily talk to them directly but
[40:33] they'll ask hey what's going on with
[40:34] this guy or like what's what's this
[40:37] what's his threshold and i have to know
[40:38] that and they have the trainers
[40:40] happening that the nutritionist have to
[40:41] know that player engagement has to know
[40:43] that so that if coaches ask if players
[40:45] ask like why was i why was i pulled
[40:47] today you can all communicate the same
[40:49] answer and then a good consistent and
[40:52] very concise like no worries man just a
[40:55] good day off you're doing great kind of
[40:57] thing just so that there's no community
[40:59] there's no complication there's no
[41:01] confusion people understand what's
[41:03] happening and we come across as a
[41:05] cohesive group that we strive to be
[41:09] um
[41:10] the last is just kind of very very broad
[41:12] but with personnel
[41:14] um personnel is an interesting one
[41:16] because it really only occurs kind of in
[41:18] like two points of the season maybe
[41:20] sometime mid-season but really that
[41:22] draft and the
[41:24] training camp is where as a performance
[41:27] analyst and as a performance team we do
[41:29] communicate with the personnel
[41:30] department more often um one of the
[41:32] things during draft is just looking at
[41:34] some variable stability this can be some
[41:36] of the speed variables that we're giving
[41:38] this is the injury grades that would
[41:40] have the injury counts that we have how
[41:42] consistent um are they from from college
[41:45] to pro is one predictive of injuries in
[41:48] colleges are you able to
[41:51] kind of look and see which is consistent
[41:53] in speed which is consistent in
[41:56] different production statistics uh which
[41:59] has the potential for improvement and
[42:00] where are some red flags for his legs
[42:02] meaning hey this guy's got ten injuries
[42:05] in college like this is much more likely
[42:08] to have a reoccurrence his career length
[42:10] is not going to be very long um just
[42:12] sort of different things like that that
[42:14] you can interpret from a performance
[42:16] standpoint where you're looking at like
[42:18] how well they're performing on the field
[42:19] how that they are how healthy they are
[42:22] another thing is within when you rank
[42:23] players
[42:24] with a data analyst ranking players is
[42:27] fun because you get to
[42:29] look at the variables that are important
[42:30] all the work that you've done through
[42:31] the year where you're saying like hey
[42:33] this is an irrelevant variable to on
[42:36] field strength this is a relevant
[42:38] variable to power this is a relevant
[42:40] variable to this ability to accelerate
[42:42] is force so from a from a personnel
[42:45] perspective you get to take that
[42:47] information and now you get to rank
[42:48] players so that you can compare trial
[42:51] guys you can compare free agents you can
[42:53] impair a training camp and you can
[42:55] compare them to our current players
[42:56] compare them within each other and kind
[42:58] of give them a comparable player like
[43:01] this guy comes in and we say he has the
[43:04] force of
[43:06] aaron donald he's lucky my goodness he
[43:08] has the speed of uh
[43:10] desean jackson and he has the
[43:13] acceleration of cooper cup so this is
[43:15] your star athlete he's the perfect
[43:16] athlete he doesn't exist but if you say
[43:18] that and give them that information then
[43:21] they can say like yes we want this guy
[43:23] we clearly want this guy um and it's a
[43:25] really cool way to kind of provide that
[43:27] performance perspective that maybe
[43:29] scouts don't get to see because it is
[43:31] one of those free agents we haven't seen
[43:32] them play in a while or you don't run
[43:34] them on the field different different
[43:36] variables that can coexist within that
[43:38] space and then finally you have the
[43:40] medical evaluation which
[43:42] kind of tries to project your estimated
[43:44] career length again this one's hard
[43:46] because you don't actually get to have a
[43:48] lot of the players that you grade in
[43:51] college a lot of them go to different
[43:52] teams a lot of them don't make the
[43:54] league so how do we um define when their
[43:57] career length is over was it due to
[43:59] injury was it due to for lack of
[44:01] performance just different things that
[44:03] you can kind of take the nuances in but
[44:05] you get an approximate estimate of like
[44:08] these types of grades go with this type
[44:11] of greater length this goes with that
[44:13] and if you have this type of injury
[44:14] we're probably going to ask you right
[44:16] away or reoccurring injuries how does
[44:18] that work um
[44:20] really benefits easy but it's a lot of
[44:23] it's good challenges to have where you
[44:25] get to be challenged from the data
[44:26] perspective and the communication
[44:29] um so finally
[44:31] what is the
[44:32] future
[44:33] of sports science
[44:35] this is where you lay down all the
[44:36] cliche quotes that we talk about every
[44:38] single day at work keep the main thing
[44:40] the main thing we want to improve
[44:42] players we want to keep them healthy we
[44:45] want to optimize their performance and
[44:47] we want to really just make sure that
[44:49] we're doing the best to put the best
[44:51] product in the field so the athletes are
[44:53] feeling the best that they can and
[44:55] everyone is performing to the highest
[44:57] standard yourself included you want to
[44:59] perform to the highest um adapt and
[45:01] evolve as i said things come up practice
[45:04] schedule changes themes changes coaches
[45:07] change when your codes change you have
[45:09] to restart your data you might have a
[45:10] different totally different practice
[45:12] philosophy and your strength coach
[45:13] exchanges you gotta restart collection
[45:15] because you might do different exercises
[45:17] you might have a different way that you
[45:19] want to emphasize the force you want to
[45:21] emphasize acceleration and velocity um
[45:24] and then just dominate the role from
[45:26] that is something that we see in the
[45:27] scouting department it's something we
[45:29] say in the coaching department it's
[45:30] mainly in the performance department
[45:32] where
[45:33] you have a role as an analyst to provide
[45:36] information and to provide it in a great
[45:38] digestible format so dominate that own
[45:40] it be the best that you can be at it get
[45:42] the small wins and really just be better
[45:45] of all your methods get the data and
[45:47] have everything come in
[45:50] so that's it thank you questions
[45:57] thank you very much sarah that was
[45:59] excellent um it was really exciting my
[46:01] background i forgot to myself but um i'm
[46:03] an assistant professor here and we do a
[46:05] lot of human performance research so i
[46:07] really enjoyed every bit of it and can
[46:09] relate um so we're going to start with
[46:11] some of the questions from the audience
[46:13] um how much is mental health being
[46:15] looked at in sports science and in what
[46:17] ways
[46:18] yeah so um mental health from sports
[46:21] science is really hard thing to track
[46:22] right because um it's very personal it's
[46:25] something that you know you don't
[46:27] necessarily discuss is open so how do we
[46:30] track it
[46:31] um we just crack different data points
[46:33] to track their stress and we track um
[46:36] it's more so getting them the resources
[46:38] i guess from a mental health perspective
[46:39] so we're not necessarily tracking the
[46:41] improvement of their mental health
[46:42] because that's personal and that's
[46:44] relative and that's that's a touchy
[46:46] thing we don't we don't want to mess
[46:47] with that we just want to make sure that
[46:49] if a guy is stressed and he's indicating
[46:51] it and he's showing it that we're giving
[46:52] him the right resources so that he can
[46:55] he can get help if he needs it
[46:58] great um and yes please continue to put
[47:01] these questions in the q a so another
[47:03] question you know you talked a lot about
[47:05] having player
[47:07] access and testing so how you know when
[47:09] you guys are doing this testing
[47:10] how long is testing i know that you know
[47:12] they're going to practice all day and
[47:13] doing these things what is kind of that
[47:14] time frame how often can you test and
[47:16] and really player compliance i know i
[47:18] work with individuals in my research and
[47:20] compliance is a huge issue so please
[47:22] explain yeah so i think um the biggest
[47:24] compliance was honestly the personal
[47:26] wellness surveys um covet actually
[47:28] sucked that back too because we used to
[47:30] have ipads set out in the gym right
[47:32] before their strength and conditioning
[47:34] where it was right in their face like
[47:35] hey don't start lifting before you fill
[47:37] this out but then with kova you have to
[47:39] separate groups so we pushed it to a
[47:42] phone app um and saw a little bit of a
[47:44] drag in in compliance right off the bat
[47:47] but i haven't been seeing a steady
[47:48] incline just as we kind of um
[47:51] put a little bit of annoyance measures
[47:53] out there in terms of text messages
[47:55] reminders um little thing hello we're
[47:58] here that sort of thing um so those sort
[48:01] of those those help um with the testing
[48:04] with the force type that's actually one
[48:05] of the things that we also ran into is
[48:07] that we wanted to make it because of
[48:09] their schedule that it's so jam-packed
[48:11] we wanted to make it part of their
[48:13] lifting routine this isn't an option you
[48:15] start your lifting by doing those jumps
[48:17] because and you just know that's how it
[48:19] goes it's not it's not if you're gonna
[48:21] do it um it's just slim it's that start
[48:23] of the job let's go part of your warm up
[48:25] here you are
[48:27] okay and is it really just
[48:29] it takes maybe like a minute for each
[48:31] layer
[48:32] oh wow okay um
[48:34] joel a says is the analytics department
[48:36] utilized by the coaches for helping
[48:38] design game plans including in-game
[48:40] decisions or is most of the analytics
[48:42] department only engaged for optimizing
[48:43] player performance
[48:45] um so
[48:47] this is just one part of it we uh
[48:49] analytics department sports science is
[48:51] one area of it but we also do i do a lot
[48:54] of work and personnel it's probably
[48:55] where most of my time is right now
[48:57] um from a coaching perspective uh we do
[49:00] help with some scouting reports we do
[49:02] help with projects here and there it's
[49:03] not necessarily an emphasis but um it is
[49:06] something that we uh you know help with
[49:08] the advance where you know we'll give
[49:10] them the data perspective of an upcoming
[49:12] opponent and break them down from our
[49:15] information that we're given um how much
[49:17] does it use
[49:19] i don't know i don't stress about it i
[49:20] think uh as an analyst you know that
[49:23] your
[49:24] job is to provide another piece of
[49:26] information and you're not in it for the
[49:28] glory you're not in it for the attention
[49:30] here just like here's another piece do
[49:32] with it as you will
[49:34] sure as some people come to me with
[49:35] information and i said here's another
[49:37] data source do it as you will
[49:43] yeah and kind of following with that you
[49:45] know so you talk about you know you're
[49:46] developing all these models and i didn't
[49:48] notice a lot of the metrics and some of
[49:49] them i was happy they look familiar to
[49:51] me um but i was wondering you know how
[49:53] much is this you guys kind of focus on
[49:56] using established metrics and how much
[49:58] you focus on developing new metrics that
[50:00] you think can kind of better delineate
[50:01] between healthy and pathological
[50:02] movement yeah that's actually really
[50:04] interesting so um
[50:06] we do use a lot of established metrics
[50:08] but we find with football again as i
[50:11] spoke about like each position and
[50:13] players so unique that you oftentimes
[50:15] have to consider like even just
[50:17] considering body weight can drastically
[50:19] change the way that you're looking at a
[50:21] metric um a lot of them don't consider
[50:23] that because you may be in a more in a
[50:25] sport that's more consistent against
[50:27] players or
[50:28] people that are more consistent
[50:30] so
[50:31] for us we do we use some of the
[50:34] established metrics and then we've also
[50:35] established our own metrics and we're
[50:37] constantly evolving in the background
[50:39] and talk about um you know these are the
[50:41] ones that our face are forefronting and
[50:43] our face aren't that everyone is seeing
[50:46] and in the back we're exploring as a
[50:48] data analyst you think you've already
[50:50] established all the thresholds it's out
[50:52] there you use it so you're in the back
[50:53] and you're kind of working and looking
[50:56] at different combinations different
[50:58] variations that um that maybe answer a
[51:01] question that we've been talking about
[51:03] again like acceleration it's such an
[51:05] easy question but it's not because
[51:07] acceleration occurs at different points
[51:09] it's like opportunity based a lot of the
[51:11] times like it's something that that is
[51:13] so simple but can be made very
[51:16] complicated
[51:18] 100
[51:20] um
[51:21] so one of the questions from nicholas
[51:23] waltz i believe um if you worked at a
[51:25] small budget facility um or team and you
[51:28] had one key sports science metric what
[51:30] would it be and why
[51:32] that's a good question
[51:34] um small budget
[51:38] so i'm thinking gps would be maybe the
[51:41] lowest um i would go with high speed
[51:43] yards um proportion over their total
[51:46] distance i think that gives you a good
[51:48] interpretation of not only how far
[51:50] they're running but like what exertion
[51:52] of that is like full speed um it can
[51:54] also conversely give you how much
[51:56] garbage yours would be running um
[51:58] as i used to be a runner and it was like
[52:00] one of those things where you're just
[52:02] like don't put in the garbage mileage
[52:04] because that's just useful wear on your
[52:06] like useless wear on your body
[52:11] no great as a non-runner i appreciate
[52:13] that um
[52:15] so
[52:16] regarding one of the things we were
[52:18] thinking of was just there's been a lot
[52:19] of acl injuries this year in the nfl do
[52:22] you guys have some thoughts on
[52:24] why and are you seeing anything in the
[52:25] numbers that would suggest why
[52:28] um i mean so we've been pretty lucky
[52:30] right with um with racl again knock on
[52:33] wood um those to me are just it's either
[52:37] lack of preparedness or um
[52:40] it's
[52:41] it i think that's it i don't know uh how
[52:44] last season really really treated people
[52:47] because it was a short season um you
[52:49] didn't have training camp a full
[52:50] training camp you didn't have pre-season
[52:53] game for some of these rookies like we
[52:54] don't know we don't necessarily use that
[52:55] on our beds but for some of the rookies
[52:58] gives you real exposure into live
[52:59] in-game speed so i think that the
[53:02] accumulation of that instant workflow
[53:04] where you weren't necessarily prep has
[53:07] really set a kind of a behind the
[53:09] starting block sort of um mentality for
[53:12] the athletes going forward and it's
[53:14] really plain catch up so how can we have
[53:16] played ketchup during the offseason how
[53:17] can we play catch up during training
[53:19] camp where we can get these guys to a
[53:22] game week kind of level of intensity
[53:27] um additionally like you've had
[53:29] the opportunity to work in different
[53:30] areas and departments how do you think
[53:32] that's really helped mold into where you
[53:34] are now
[53:35] i think it's been um it's been
[53:37] instrumental in my involvement like
[53:39] really to be able to communicate with
[53:41] all these different sources like i
[53:43] learned things that i wouldn't have even
[53:45] thought about um i've been able to
[53:48] articulate certain stuff that i can't i
[53:51] couldn't before and i wouldn't even like
[53:53] i wouldn't know um it's learning it's
[53:56] also it's learning how to talk but it's
[53:57] also learning how to keep quiet and
[53:59] you're in a room with all these amazing
[54:01] intelligent people and it's just keeping
[54:03] my mouth shut i'm listening and already
[54:05] know it's like i'm i'm a big on learning
[54:08] and getting better so if i'm in a room
[54:09] with these amazing talented intelligent
[54:12] people i'm hearing and i'm trying to get
[54:14] as much as i can so that i can either
[54:17] ask questions at the end if needed or go
[54:19] to someone independently okay i heard
[54:21] you say this or just like write it down
[54:23] look up things on my own time kind of
[54:25] taking as much information as possible
[54:27] and it's also just like being present
[54:29] and getting your
[54:30] your face around the building i'm four
[54:33] years and now we do have an influx of
[54:35] coaching changes we have everything
[54:37] changing so like for you to um be
[54:40] present on all these different fields
[54:41] you can gain a little bit of respect you
[54:43] can um
[54:45] gain kind of a reputation in a good way
[54:47] as like hey she knows this or she knows
[54:49] that um and kind of be present so that
[54:52] people understand that like you can
[54:54] count me for different sources of
[54:56] information and i will do the best to
[54:58] kind of articulate that to you
[55:01] great great advice in general i think
[55:03] for any kind of field um so you know one
[55:06] of the things you touched on when we
[55:07] first started was this you know and
[55:09] acknowledging the the panel before us
[55:10] and how many women were on the panel um
[55:12] have you noticed the growth of females
[55:14] in the industry what kind of
[55:16] opportunities you see going forward and
[55:18] do you think being female gives you a
[55:20] unique perfect uh perspective
[55:22] um i think
[55:24] i think i've noticed a big growth i'll
[55:26] start with the first part in women in
[55:27] sports in general and women in football
[55:30] um women in analytics especially too i
[55:33] mean when i started i think there were
[55:34] two or three of us and now they're seven
[55:36] or eight which it's four years and it's
[55:38] not enough but if you consider the size
[55:40] of the department it's um it's quite
[55:42] significant i think um one of the ways
[55:45] that maybe we're lacking is women in
[55:46] major roles um and bigger roles and more
[55:49] important roles um to where we actually
[55:51] have power to
[55:53] hire more women to promote more women to
[55:56] um just sort of be in that position of
[55:58] authority where you're not just kind of
[56:00] the bad voice you're actually uh after
[56:03] level you're managing you're doing what
[56:05] you need to do um i think being a woman
[56:07] in sport can be difficult um
[56:10] it's not for the thin skinned
[56:13] but i don't think that's necessarily
[56:15] independent of just being a woman i
[56:17] think that's for anyone male female
[56:19] whatever you identify with
[56:21] you gotta be tough like this is sport
[56:23] you're here to win games when things go
[56:25] wrong
[56:26] you have to be able to take it and um so
[56:29] i really think that like
[56:30] as a woman
[56:32] that's important but as a person that's
[56:34] more important um i don't
[56:36] i don't think it presents challenges i
[56:38] don't think it should percent challenge
[56:40] i mean it presents challenges in terms
[56:41] of entry in terms of respect whatever
[56:44] but in terms of like doing your actual
[56:46] job and what you were hired for and how
[56:48] you can do it no you're you i don't care
[56:51] you are good at your job you're here for
[56:52] a reason and you deserve to be here so
[56:55] that's fine
[56:57] i like it
[56:58] so we have another couple more questions
[57:00] coming through so what technical skills
[57:02] do you frequently use in your job
[57:04] yeah so uh i use all the basics are sql
[57:08] tableau python if i have to um but uh
[57:13] really just
[57:14] those are kind of the technical ones
[57:16] that i have um
[57:18] learning to work with different data
[57:20] formats i think is something that's
[57:21] maybe not just talked about you know we
[57:23] work a lot with like csv using but learn
[57:26] about json violence learn about uh the
[57:29] importing different types of data that
[57:31] you have um
[57:32] like how you can use it in our how
[57:34] because now most of the files that you
[57:36] deal with are very nested data frames
[57:39] that are massive so if you can learn how
[57:41] to kind of manipulate those different
[57:42] sources i think that that's more
[57:44] important i think the technology that
[57:46] you use isn't as important to do that as
[57:48] long as you can do it
[57:51] right well thank you kevin for that
[57:53] question and then zach has a question um
[57:55] did you find any less or more cultural
[57:57] war pushback starting in sports science
[57:59] rather than coaching slash game strategy
[58:03] um
[58:04] cultural pushback is that
[58:06] cultural uh yeah so i don't know if it
[58:08] was kind of this idea of because you may
[58:10] be started in sports science um rather
[58:12] than in coaching and game strategy do
[58:14] you see like there's any difference of
[58:16] where you're coming in from
[58:17] um
[58:19] i was lucky when i came into sports
[58:22] science and that that department had
[58:24] really established a good foundation and
[58:26] they were at a point where
[58:28] their data had reached kind of the
[58:30] limits as to what they could do with it
[58:32] and they needed someone with a more
[58:34] analytical math background to sort of
[58:37] take it to the next level and evolve and
[58:39] adjust like that when i switched into
[58:41] personnel it was very um
[58:44] natural because it was from questions
[58:45] that i was asked and it was questions
[58:48] that you know um that they wanted
[58:50] answered so it it felt smooth but it's
[58:53] still uh in terms of pushback it still
[58:56] was you know you get some certain um
[58:58] direct questions that uh don't
[59:00] necessarily show respect of the game i
[59:03] guess um so you have to
[59:05] you do have to prove your knowledge i
[59:06] don't think that's in like i don't think
[59:08] the best would be coming from sports
[59:10] science i think that's people coming in
[59:11] general um that you will want to show
[59:14] what you can do um coaching
[59:16] i just kind of um pushed myself on that
[59:19] one if we're being honest just started
[59:21] sending out emails um sending little
[59:24] keys of information to some of the
[59:26] coaches that maybe i had better
[59:28] relationships with that we would like
[59:30] chat about about the games and in the
[59:32] office and i'd be like oh yeah i know i
[59:33] got something for you um even just the
[59:35] other day i was talking to coach like
[59:37] wait do you do this i'm like yeah i
[59:39] can't we'll send it to you right away
[59:41] and it's just like little things like
[59:42] that where um you take those little wins
[59:45] and give them information because at
[59:47] some point it's going to help so
[59:50] yeah
[59:51] i think we're just about time but i
[59:52] wanted to kind of leave off with this
[59:53] one question do you have any advice for
[59:56] you know anybody trying to get into this
[59:57] field we have a number of students on
[59:58] here so what kind of advice would you
[60:00] give them
[60:01] yeah i think um i get this question a
[60:02] lot i think most people do
[60:04] it's not an easy field to get into so
[60:07] first thing is just ask yourself like do
[60:08] you really love sport and do you love
[60:10] numbers because i think it's often time
[60:12] to glamorize when the truth is it's like
[60:15] it is a fun job don't get me wrong you
[60:17] get family i love this job but
[60:19] you're working long hours oftentimes you
[60:21] start a poor wage
[60:23] it's easy to get into when you're in
[60:26] it's fun and it is so worth it and i
[60:28] encourage everyone to do their best um
[60:30] you know it's like what everyone was
[60:32] saying do the work put in research like
[60:34] put yourself out there present things
[60:37] get things published whether it's
[60:38] through your school talk to your
[60:40] professors about maybe doing a project
[60:42] with them that's how i started um with
[60:44] getting work kind of in the public
[60:45] spheres i just i realized that i didn't
[60:47] have anything published and i was like i
[60:49] need i need some exposure or something
[60:52] on my resume that says that i can do
[60:54] verified academic work um so i spoke to
[60:56] a professor and someone that i had a
[60:59] good communication with and she helped
[61:00] me and she was amazing and we got
[61:02] together and we talked about things that
[61:04] we both like and how we can
[61:06] kind of
[61:06] merge those two ideas i think it's
[61:08] really just mastering your skill set um
[61:12] you can get into sports analytics and
[61:14] you can find your door and it's like
[61:16] everyone said don't um don't necessarily
[61:19] be so pigeonholed on a sport or a
[61:21] section of sport or some like area that
[61:24] you must do because if you want to get
[61:26] there you will but it is really
[61:28] important to get your foot in the door
[61:30] and get some experience if you're good
[61:32] with numbers then you're going with data
[61:34] that skills often transferable to other
[61:36] sports so really mastering that
[61:38] technique being good at the math behind
[61:40] it being good at the questions being
[61:42] asking good at communicating
[61:43] interpreting what people want from you
[61:46] cleaning working with making different
[61:47] data sources
[61:49] being a full evolved person where you
[61:51] can
[61:52] where you can be in multiple facets is
[61:55] going to help you so much and just like
[61:57] everyone said just apply like when i
[61:59] applied for this job i said no way no
[62:01] way am i going to get that i'm not
[62:03] qualified at all um five multiple drugs
[62:06] that i was not qualified for some that i
[62:08] was probably overqualified for didn't
[62:10] hear back from again probably 90 of them
[62:14] um don't be discouraged don't like
[62:17] everyone was saying this before don't
[62:18] take it personal um just keep working if
[62:22] it doesn't work this round put something
[62:24] new out there try something again try a
[62:26] data competition big data bolts coming
[62:28] out enter it do it um
[62:31] try different try different things that
[62:33] challenge you because um you're not
[62:35] going to really know unless you try
[62:38] wonderful wonderful advice um thank you
[62:41] sarah so much for a wonderful
[62:42] presentation um thank you again to the
[62:44] organizers of this conference dr yan for
[62:47] amazing conference and
[62:48] thank you all for listening
