[00:00] hello W welcome to the uh one of our
[00:04] first parallel sessions this is a
[00:06] session sponsored by the uh Corey
[00:08] Stringer Institute so my name is Jackson
[00:10] Lauder I'll be the chair I'm from uh
[00:13] Bentley University just because we have
[00:15] four speakers and I want to keep the
[00:17] time as quick as possible I'm going to
[00:18] keep the introductions very brief and on
[00:21] that note our first speaker is Julie
[00:24] Berlin from the University of
[00:26] Connecticut so Julie
[00:35] hello so today I'm going to talk about
[00:37] cumulative impact load injury and
[00:39] cartilage synthesis in College women's
[00:41] basketball
[00:43] athletes so there are approximately
[00:45] 500,000 female basketball athletes both
[00:48] in the high school and Collegiate
[00:49] settings that have um are vulnerable to
[00:52] injury risk and you know when we think
[00:54] about injury and and what that does to a
[00:57] person um you know it can cause a lot of
[00:59] long long term joint health issues as
[01:01] well as psychological consequences and
[01:04] can really alter someone's quality of
[01:05] life long
[01:07] term injuries specifically um what we'll
[01:10] talk about today they can they can occur
[01:11] from both acute high impact loads or
[01:14] from cumulative loading over time right
[01:16] so someone takes a really hard step one
[01:17] time gets injured or someone kind of
[01:19] takes a lot of repetitive steps over
[01:22] time and you know Dr Morgan did a nice
[01:25] job talking about impact loads and
[01:27] forces um so I'll just Orient you
[01:29] slightly um quickly here to this image
[01:31] um we can often measure impacts through
[01:35] um Force plates or inertial measurement
[01:37] units um and so on the bottom we see
[01:40] estimated vertical ground reaction
[01:42] forces um so during running as well as
[01:45] kind of the tibial acceleration values
[01:46] that we would get from an IMU and these
[01:49] are nice because they can go right you
[01:51] know with the athlete wherever they are
[01:53] during
[01:54] activity so impact loading during
[01:56] Landing has been associated with acute
[01:58] joint injuries such as ACL tears um as
[02:02] well as chronic overuse injuries such as
[02:04] patelofemoral
[02:05] pain unfortunately females are six times
[02:08] more likely than males to sustain
[02:10] injuries like this and 40 almost 42% of
[02:14] traumatic joint injuries occur at the
[02:16] knee and the ankle um and both of these
[02:18] increase the risk for joint OA
[02:21] osteoarthritis excuse
[02:26] me so we wanted to look at whether
[02:28] impact load was related to lower
[02:30] extremity injury uh specifically in a
[02:32] more athletic uh population versus just
[02:34] in running so we know that excessive
[02:37] impact loads during Landing can be
[02:39] injurious to muscular skeletal tissue
[02:42] such as cartilage bone um especially if
[02:44] these forces are not appropriately
[02:46] attenuated so what we have on this graph
[02:49] um on the Le hand side of the screen is
[02:51] a um depiction of impact load per minute
[02:53] and cumulative impact load that was
[02:55] estimated through two um wearable Imus
[02:58] on the lower leg this was taken during
[03:00] running so as you can see um over the
[03:02] course of about an hour maybe 45 minutes
[03:06] um the impact load per minute kind of
[03:09] increased but it was pretty constant and
[03:11] as that duration went up cumulative
[03:13] impact load also
[03:16] increased what we have here is now a
[03:18] depiction of a basketball um physical
[03:20] activity um session so over the course
[03:24] of the session you can see that impact
[03:25] load per minute was much more variable
[03:28] um had a lot more higher Peak
[03:30] and again that cumulative impact load
[03:32] did increase substantially compared to
[03:35] you know a running just a straight line
[03:36] running um
[03:39] task so to this point high impact loads
[03:42] coupled with you know potential faulty
[03:44] alignments or um faulty movement
[03:46] patterns may actually amplify abnormal
[03:49] loading of joints um specifically
[03:51] increasing long-term risk for you know
[03:53] joint damage and
[03:56] reinjury so we know that accumula
[04:00] acute and cumulative impact forces have
[04:02] been associated with running related
[04:04] injuries but there's less evidence of
[04:05] this relationship in basketball athletes
[04:07] specifically at the lower
[04:10] limb there has been previous work that
[04:13] have utilized these sensors to evaluate
[04:15] relationships between impact load
[04:17] cumulative bone stimulus and Bone stress
[04:19] injuries in male basketball athletes um
[04:21] this has been done in the NBA as well as
[04:23] in some college division one teams um
[04:25] some of this research is still
[04:27] unpublished um but there has been very
[04:29] limited work in women's um basketball
[04:33] athletes so we also wanted to know how
[04:37] impact loading can affect joint health
[04:38] and injury risk right because we you
[04:40] know we want to keep our players healthy
[04:42] and we want to keep their joints healthy
[04:43] long term even if they do sustain
[04:46] injury so excessive impact forces you
[04:49] know not only can they cause injury but
[04:51] they also might initiate an inflammatory
[04:53] process in the joint itself um and there
[04:56] has been some previous work that has dis
[04:59] discussed serum biomarker panels um that
[05:01] measure cartilage metabolism so both
[05:03] degradation and synthesis markers that
[05:06] can potentially identify individuals um
[05:08] who might go on to um sustain a lower
[05:10] extremity injury and the reason why
[05:13] these serum um biomarkers have been
[05:15] studied is because they're not abundant
[05:17] in healthy joints right so if we took
[05:18] someone who's never had a lower
[05:19] extremity injury and pulled some blood
[05:22] likely we wouldn't see elevated levels
[05:24] of these Mar these markers um
[05:27] additionally these have been um
[05:29] established as kind of an early
[05:31] indication of trauma or potentially load
[05:33] related inflammation and some previous
[05:35] Studies have looked at these markers um
[05:38] before you know someone starts a a
[05:40] training program especially in the
[05:41] military and they found that actually
[05:43] elevations in some of these markers
[05:45] those Cadets went on to tear their ACL
[05:48] during that you know study period so it
[05:50] has been identified as potential injury
[05:52] risk um in some
[05:56] populations so you know we really wanted
[05:59] to kind of helped predict injury risk so
[06:01] our Central questions were are high
[06:02] impact load and cumulative limb load
[06:05] related to injury and can a subset of
[06:08] impact load metrics and Crum biomarkers
[06:10] provide some of these important like
[06:12] indicators for us um of an athlete
[06:14] that's potentially you know developing
[06:16] or at risk for a near future
[06:20] injury again really we wanted to
[06:22] identify whether athletes um you know in
[06:25] our team might be uh at risk for a lower
[06:27] extremity joint injury or performance
[06:29] deficit
[06:32] so what we did was we employed a
[06:33] prospective longitudinal season study
[06:35] over a single season that track from
[06:38] about August to the end of April um we
[06:40] collected daily impact load using these
[06:43] two um their blue Trident um inertial
[06:45] measurement unit sensors we also looked
[06:48] at cartilage biomarkers across the
[06:50] entire season as we thought that these U
[06:52] metrics might fluctuate with different
[06:54] differing levels of impact load and
[06:56] intensity throughout the season we
[06:58] collected biomarkers at the offseason so
[07:00] before they even started any uh
[07:02] basketball related activities during
[07:04] their preseason twice during their
[07:06] regular season once before playoffs and
[07:08] then once again after they had ceased
[07:11] all basketball
[07:12] activities and we really wanted to
[07:14] correlate these impact metrics with RCM
[07:17] biomarkers um to identify people at risk
[07:20] and to also establish you know the
[07:22] relationship between impact load and
[07:24] biomarkers um with lower extremity joint
[07:26] injury and to kind of look at these
[07:28] relationships together as it hasn't
[07:30] really been done in this
[07:33] population so for our methods we had um
[07:37] 11 Collegiate female basketball athletes
[07:40] um again who participated in this uh
[07:42] longitudinal study we collected like I
[07:44] said daily impact load metrics um the
[07:48] software that was utilized calculated
[07:50] cumulative bone stimulus as well as
[07:52] impact load and step count intensity so
[07:54] that's how hard someone when they're
[07:56] stepping how hard or how many G's that
[07:59] um sensor experience or that limb
[08:01] experience during that step particularly
[08:03] and this was collected again every day
[08:05] during
[08:08] practice over those six different time
[08:10] points we did collect those serum
[08:12] biomarkers of cartilage metabolism and
[08:14] we looked at one marker of cartilage
[08:17] degradation which was the C2C as well as
[08:20] um two markers of cartilage synthesis
[08:22] cp2 and cs846 I won't ask you to
[08:25] remember those um but generally we
[08:27] collected both degradation and synthesis
[08:29] because we wanted to look at you know
[08:30] metabolism and whether or not there were
[08:32] changes in either of those again those
[08:34] were collected at six time points and
[08:36] Frozen and processed on the back end of
[08:38] the study
[08:41] altoe and then we looked at the
[08:43] incidence of lower extremity injury this
[08:44] was recorded by the team's athletic
[08:46] trainer um or their usual protocol um
[08:49] injury was defined as um being removed
[08:53] from play diagnosed by an injury by the
[08:55] athletic trainer healthc care
[08:56] professional um Team physician um that
[08:59] um required or caused them to lose one
[09:01] or more days in um actual
[09:04] participation and for the purpose of the
[09:06] study because we were looking at joint
[09:08] um cartilage we only looked at lower
[09:10] extremity joint injuries so we did not
[09:11] look at like muscular injuries or trunk
[09:13] or upper extremity injuries that were
[09:17] sustained so for impact load again um
[09:21] you should be familiar with this graph
[09:23] but impact load was calculated um based
[09:25] on the number of steps at each specific
[09:27] G that the um IMU measured and so the
[09:30] metric was um output as the total number
[09:33] of steps by the actual like acceleration
[09:36] value that um that it was calculated
[09:40] out for step count and impact intensity
[09:43] um we have um the way that the software
[09:47] uh captures these is that it bends um
[09:49] actual step counts and intensities into
[09:51] three different bins one is from 1 to 5
[09:54] that's the low intensity medium
[09:56] intensity is from 6 to 20 G's and then
[09:59] high intensity is from 21 to 200 g so
[10:02] these sensors I particularly use for
[10:04] this study because they had the higher
[10:05] capacity to capture higher accelerations
[10:08] where some older Imus don't they cap at
[10:10] like 16g so we would lose a lot of those
[10:12] higher impacts especially with
[10:14] basketball
[10:17] athletes cumulative bone stimulus is
[10:19] essentially calculated um or it's an
[10:22] estimate of the peak resultant
[10:23] acceleration or impact from every foot
[10:25] contact with the ground throughout the
[10:27] duration of practice
[10:31] so as for sensor use and placement we
[10:32] had these really ugly orange bands um
[10:35] that went just uh one cent um one IMU
[10:38] width above the medial malas on both the
[10:41] left and right limbs um the Imus were
[10:43] oriented properly so that the global
[10:45] coordinate systems of each um IMU were
[10:49] appropriate for the left and right
[10:51] limbs these were put on before practice
[10:54] and taken off
[10:56] after so um to describe kind of impact
[10:59] load cartilage markers across the season
[11:02] um over the course of the Season we had
[11:05] 13 joint injuries including some lateral
[11:07] ankle sprains uh tibial femoral
[11:09] cartilage lesion uh medial collateral
[11:11] ligament injury patellar dislocation um
[11:16] and we really we we described a lot of
[11:20] these results descriptively initially
[11:22] because this is a very small sample and
[11:24] it was a preliminary study just
[11:26] initially evaluating these relationships
[11:28] in this population so to orient you to
[11:31] this graph this is um a descriptive plot
[11:33] of impact load and injury over the
[11:35] course of a season so at the bottom it's
[11:37] kind of hard to see but you have weeks
[11:39] um it goes from week one to week 25 we
[11:42] essentially sum data over the course of
[11:44] a week that um was Sunday to Saturday um
[11:49] and kind of lump them into like
[11:50] preseason regular season and postseason
[11:52] time points because this is what's
[11:53] important to us right um the blue line
[11:56] is left right uh orange is bright and
[11:59] green is total impact load so just to
[12:01] give you kind of an example of what that
[12:03] looks like over the course of the season
[12:05] and the asteris denote the um recorded
[12:07] joint injuries that
[12:09] happened um additionally for our um the
[12:13] relationship between um impact load
[12:16] biomarkers and injury we use Point by
[12:18] serial correlations and then to look at
[12:20] you know the season long injury
[12:22] incidents and cartilage markers and
[12:24] impact load we looked at um Pierce and
[12:26] product moment
[12:28] correlations so again descriptively for
[12:30] our um biomarkers we have our
[12:32] degradation marker on top and our two
[12:34] synthesis markers on the bottom um there
[12:37] we didn't run in uh any differences
[12:40] between these at each time Point um but
[12:42] we can kind of see that they there's
[12:44] there's not a real massive like increase
[12:46] in any of these except for the bottom um
[12:48] from offseason to preseason where we saw
[12:50] a a very large jump um in the
[12:53] concentrations um comparatively to the
[12:56] other um two markers
[12:59] so what we what we actually found
[13:01] statistically was that when we looked at
[13:04] impact intensity and its relationship to
[13:06] injury we found that individuals that
[13:08] had increased medium range so they took
[13:11] more steps in that 6 to 20 um G range um
[13:16] during like the week five which was
[13:18] around you know mid to late October so
[13:20] still preseason technically um when they
[13:24] had increased steps in that range as
[13:26] well as increased steps in the high
[13:28] range um dur during week eight which was
[13:30] just a couple weeks after that so still
[13:32] very very um on the tail end of
[13:34] transitioning from um preseason to
[13:36] regular season um these were both
[13:38] associated with increased risk of injury
[13:41] and what we saw um again just
[13:43] descriptively is that like over um
[13:46] underneath each one of these bins is the
[13:49] mean and standard deviation of the steps
[13:51] that were taken for all athletes over
[13:53] the course of the entire season um so
[13:55] there's obviously a wide standard
[13:56] deviation but the point is is that they
[13:59] had the most steps in the low range
[14:01] which is great right they can take all
[14:03] the steps they want in that low G range
[14:06] but as they um as we had more people
[14:09] that had medium and higher impacts in
[14:12] those in those medium and high ranges
[14:14] those were when we started to see that
[14:16] they were experiencing injury um in that
[14:18] same kind of
[14:23] week so when we looked at cumulative
[14:25] bone stimulus and cartilage metabolism
[14:27] and its relationship to Y what we found
[14:30] was that the um increase in cartilage
[14:33] synthesis was uh also associated with
[14:35] increased cumulative bone stimulus um at
[14:38] our kind of playoff or postseason time
[14:41] point for both Limbs and um another our
[14:45] other cartilage synthesis marker um at
[14:48] preseason um so at the offseason when
[14:50] they haven't even started playing as
[14:52] well as at the very beginning of their
[14:54] um regular season um this was also
[14:57] associated with increased um Seas season
[14:59] long injury incidences so when I was
[15:01] looking at these results I was like huh
[15:02] that's interesting like we have this
[15:04] elevation in cartilage synthesis which
[15:05] actually doesn't track with what you
[15:07] think you know we we'd probably you know
[15:10] assume that you'd see cartilage
[15:11] degradation markers but we saw this
[15:13] increase in cartilage synthesis um and
[15:15] it was associated with season long
[15:17] injury incidents um in these athlets
[15:21] specifically so what's the clinical
[15:23] relevance of this right so it's clear I
[15:26] mean again this is a preliminary study
[15:28] but there were temporal changes in this
[15:30] impact intensity in our cumulative bone
[15:32] stimulus and cartilage biomarkers and
[15:35] really kind of underscoring how these
[15:37] relationships are obviously Dynamic
[15:38] through n uh through the season which we
[15:41] expect um what I was very surprised to
[15:44] see was kind of the relationship between
[15:45] preseason and early season cartilage
[15:47] synthesis markers um and subsequent
[15:50] injury incidents right um and this
[15:52] really you know to me and to some of my
[15:55] colleagues highlights the potential uh
[15:57] feasibility of these biomarkers serving
[15:59] as early predictors of injury
[16:01] susceptibility or there's some
[16:02] underlying joint issue that's going on
[16:04] in these healthy
[16:07] athletes this also increases our
[16:09] understanding of how mechanical loading
[16:11] might be related to biological responses
[16:13] right specifically with regards to
[16:15] cartilage
[16:16] metabolism and it really kind of
[16:18] highlights the implication um for
[16:20] metabolic joint changes and intensity
[16:22] over the season so as intensity changes
[16:25] we have changes in these biomarkers like
[16:27] how does that relate
[16:31] longterm and then long-term implications
[16:33] really include you know once we kind of
[16:36] do this study again in a larger
[16:38] population um and find maybe find
[16:41] similar findings you know our hope is to
[16:42] really include some tailored injury
[16:44] prevention strategies and training
[16:46] interventions um to these groups to help
[16:49] them move appropriately help them load
[16:50] appropriately um and reduce you know
[16:53] joint joint injury as well as maintain
[16:55] joint health um throughout their career
[16:58] and after
[17:06] thanks take any questions if you have
[17:15] any
[17:26] yeah they might be
[17:38] um for this particular study we didn't
[17:39] have anyone like have an issue or have
[17:42] concerns about providing their blood
[17:43] serum um what I did was I waited until
[17:47] the end of the season so following the
[17:49] cessation of the study um period to
[17:52] actually process of biomarkers and it
[17:54] actually took me another like four to
[17:56] five months to kind of work through
[17:57] those processing results um so we've
[18:00] also shared these results only globally
[18:03] with these athletes we didn't give
[18:05] individual um like biomarker levels just
[18:08] from like a an IRB sake um as well as
[18:12] from a um like interpretability sake I
[18:15] think the the general results make are
[18:17] more impactful than someone's single
[18:18] biomarker level at a single time
[18:21] Point yes
[18:36] yeah that's a good question um when we
[18:38] were designing the study we were
[18:39] thinking about it but we ran out of
[18:40] budget so we stuck with the the
[18:42] cartilage but um honestly that would be
[18:44] something that I would if I were to
[18:46] repeat the study I would absolutely add
[18:47] because that would kind of give us
[18:49] another layer of information about you
[18:51] know joint health and the processes
[18:53] going on in their
[18:56] body thanks yeah actually collecting
[18:59] data in the lab right now for a
[19:01] Department of Defense Grant we have so I
[19:04] was asked to speak here and I thought
[19:06] there isn't a more inappropriate place
[19:07] for me to present because I know nothing
[19:09] about data science but my fiance is
[19:12] actually a data engineer so trying to
[19:14] sneak my way into it and they asked me
[19:17] to present on the swimmer that I coached
[19:20] through a record-breaking swim so I'm an
[19:22] athlete I'm a triathlon coach and I tend
[19:26] to do some crazy things I try to break
[19:28] the record for the fastest run across
[19:31] the Appalachian Trail in Connecticut
[19:33] which is 51 miles did that um
[19:36] ultramarathon so I feel like when people
[19:38] want to do crazy athletic things they
[19:41] have a habit of reaching out to me um
[19:43] I'm about to coach this girl who's going
[19:46] to become the first woman ever to swim
[19:47] between all seven continents so that's
[19:49] going to be very interesting and so this
[19:53] this friend of mine who I used to
[19:54] compete with decided to have these
[19:58] insane ideas to do these crazy long
[20:00] swims and this was a 24 mile swim he
[20:03] swam from Providence R Island he jumped
[20:05] in the water and swam all the way to
[20:06] Jamestown Rhode Island so it was 24
[20:08] miles it was his third uh third crazy
[20:11] swim that he did he raised over a
[20:13] quarter of a million dollars to clean
[20:15] the oceans through a company called
[20:16] clean ocean access and this is just kind
[20:19] of our story of me coaching him uh the
[20:22] metrics that we collected I'll try to
[20:24] talk about it in a data science way if I
[20:26] can it's the movie is on Amazon Prime so
[20:30] if you want to go ahead and rent the
[20:31] movie and watch his journey it's all
[20:33] about his sobriety he's 11 years sober
[20:36] and his journey of finding Triathlon and
[20:38] swimming through sobriety and then
[20:40] continuing along that journey and it's
[20:42] pretty inspirational it's a really good
[20:43] documentary just came out last year so
[20:47] he asked me to coach him and at first I
[20:49] was a little nervous and I said okay
[20:51] we'll go out in this adventure together
[20:53] and after three years I feel like we
[20:54] really got the hang of it so just to
[20:56] give you a little bit of a background he
[20:58] was moving from Connecticut to Vermont
[21:00] he was working at a private school
[21:02] working at a new private school in
[21:03] Vermont so we had to really balance a
[21:05] lot of his training around his
[21:07] day-to-day life it was 45 minutes to the
[21:09] closest pool he was starting to train in
[21:11] January when it's very cold so you can't
[21:13] do Open Water swimming so this just
[21:15] gives you an idea of our periodization
[21:18] of the volume throughout uh the
[21:21] beginning of the year and then his swim
[21:23] was that last week in July so you can
[21:25] see he was around like 18 to 20,000
[21:27] yards a week which really isn't that
[21:29] much if you think about someone who's
[21:31] competitively swimming in high school or
[21:33] college but again for him you know we're
[21:35] trying to balance work life with his
[21:37] personal life and just some ideas and
[21:40] strategies of how we coached him so we
[21:42] tried to do three weeks of increased
[21:44] volume followed by recovery week which
[21:46] didn't work out every week because
[21:48] sometimes life gets in the way a
[21:49] concussion gets in the way running into
[21:51] the stairs in your house and uh he had
[21:53] two kids so obviously it was tough if
[21:55] they had games and things like that uh
[21:57] we would do 3 days of strong training
[21:59] one day of recovery Swimming by uh
[22:02] followed by two more strong days and uh
[22:05] you know to get ready for the swim I
[22:07] reached out to a couple really cool
[22:08] people Sid Cassidy has the record for
[22:11] the double crossing of the English
[22:13] Channel and he also was Team USA Coach
[22:16] uh for the Open Water Swim Team for a
[22:18] couple years and so I talked to him on
[22:20] the phone and he was telling me three
[22:22] weeks out we want to try to get to 60%
[22:24] of the total volume of the event day so
[22:26] around three weeks out we went for an
[22:28] 11-hour swim and uh he was eating turkey
[22:31] sandwiches and cookies we were trying to
[22:33] figure out what would sit well with his
[22:34] stomach we've been trying to figure out
[22:36] for three years what would sit well with
[22:38] his stomach but um that's an that's an
[22:40] idea of the periodization how he went
[22:42] from from day to day now I use a program
[22:45] called training Peaks it's a really cool
[22:47] platform it basically takes the data off
[22:50] of his watch loads it up to this
[22:53] platform and then I get an idea of his
[22:55] training stress score which is his TSS
[22:58] the intensity factor fatigue different
[23:01] types of fatigue annual training load
[23:03] versus a chronic training load and just
[23:05] to make all of this simple it's really
[23:08] estimated off of his swim speed so if
[23:11] you're a swimmer if you're an endurance
[23:13] swimmer per se there's something called
[23:15] your critical swim speed usually if uh
[23:18] you train at the Olympic Training Center
[23:20] Team USA they calculate that by swimming
[23:23] a 400 yard set all out as fast as you
[23:25] can then you take 3 minutes of rest and
[23:28] then do a 200 yard set all out at once
[23:30] and then you put that into equation and
[23:32] that gives you your critical swim speed
[23:34] which ideally is the speed that you
[23:36] could swim for an hour without
[23:38] decreasing your speed so depending on
[23:41] the day workout how fast he was swimming
[23:44] in relationship to his critical swim
[23:46] speed would give us some of these uh uh
[23:50] fatigue factors so some of them are
[23:52] fatigue factors over the course of a
[23:54] couple days some of them are fatigue
[23:56] factors over the course of a week and
[23:57] then some are over the course of a month
[23:59] so you can see the fatigue the the pink
[24:02] line here in his annual training load I
[24:05] think one of the interesting points here
[24:06] as he went on one of his first long
[24:08] swims around four 4,000 kilometers in
[24:11] May and you can see how much that spiked
[24:14] his annual training load fatigue but
[24:16] then if you look at his swim where he
[24:18] actually went 41,000 yards that was his
[24:20] 24 mile swim the fatigue Factor was
[24:23] almost similar so by by using this um
[24:26] periodization to increase load let them
[24:29] recover you know we tried to keep that
[24:31] annual training load or that fatigue
[24:33] Factor the same throughout these these
[24:35] weeks of really high volume so that's
[24:38] one cool thing that these programs and
[24:40] the data allows us to do is track his
[24:42] annual annual training load his fatigue
[24:46] try to see when he needs to recover so
[24:48] that we can then boost performance um
[24:51] but I think that's a pretty cool
[24:52] visualization
[24:54] there so train blocks and workout
[24:56] examples so the way this program works
[24:58] is you have Monday through Sunday and
[25:00] you can go ahead and drag your workouts
[25:01] into each day so he usually did his long
[25:04] swims on the weekends so I'd give him a
[25:06] little bit of a recovery day on Monday
[25:08] and then on Tuesdays some longer
[25:10] intervals so I have him doing 3x 500
[25:13] using paddles Which are these really
[25:16] large circular plastic paddles you put
[25:18] on your hands usually with a p buoy in
[25:21] between the legs so he's really working
[25:22] his lat muscles his upper body um so we
[25:25] on that day we had 3x 500 and probably
[25:28] had some more longer sets after that and
[25:30] then short rest working on maybe a
[25:33] little bit more aerobic capacity so 20
[25:35] sets of 50 yards alternating probably
[25:38] fast and slow with short rest in between
[25:41] um and then his long swims more so on
[25:44] the weekend so that day we did 10,000
[25:46] yards he was in the open water for
[25:47] around three hours and he lived in Rhode
[25:50] Island so he would swim around his dock
[25:52] put his Gatorade his drinks his food and
[25:55] everything on top of the dock so he had
[25:56] that readily accessible
[25:59] so swim details this was kind of a cool
[26:01] aspect to to manage and plan because
[26:04] there's a lot of things we had to think
[26:05] about shipping channels talking to the
[26:07] Coast Guard talking to local police
[26:10] organizing all of that was was quite a
[26:12] hassle but for sure very fun so we had
[26:15] to figure out the currents how the
[26:17] currents worked and the data signs with
[26:19] the current is actually really
[26:20] interesting I'll try to play a video um
[26:22] the safety of the water quality the
[26:24] ideal time to leave he swam from Block
[26:27] Island one year here to Jamestown which
[26:30] was interesting cuz those were really
[26:31] shark infested waters and he actually
[26:33] had a shark collar around his ankle it
[26:35] was a 6 foot long item that looked like
[26:37] a snake and what was funny was he knew
[26:40] that it was going to send off this
[26:42] electrical signal every 6 seconds to
[26:44] tell the Sharks to stay away but what he
[26:45] didn't realize it was going to shock him
[26:47] every six seconds so he did a 9 to 10
[26:50] hour swim with this thing shocking his
[26:51] leg every six seconds and that year the
[26:54] water got down to like 63 degrees and he
[26:56] was getting really cold so we were
[26:58] trying to brainstorm what to do about it
[26:59] we put a second cap on him to try to
[27:01] keep him warm um so trying to figure out
[27:05] if he's going to be too cold too warm
[27:07] psychological component I'll tell you
[27:09] the way that he gets over the
[27:11] psychological component is he listens to
[27:12] reggae music the entire time so this
[27:15] 14-hour swim he just did 24 miles was
[27:18] all reggae and what's interesting his
[27:20] stroke rate how many times he takes a
[27:23] stroke per minute is around 50 Strokes
[27:25] per minute and if you know the tempo of
[27:27] reg music get about 50 beats so he was
[27:30] listening to rea the entire time we were
[27:31] tracking his stroke break the entire
[27:33] time and it was even the entire time
[27:35] which was pretty cool so we were trying
[27:37] to figure out where to get him in I just
[27:39] went over that uh the that's where he
[27:42] started um up in the the Bay of um
[27:46] Providence so here are unique
[27:48] considerations the Sharks we did see a
[27:50] shark that year um which was interesting
[27:52] and we we pulled him aside and said do
[27:54] you want to keep going and he said yep
[27:55] I'll keep going um jellyfish did the
[27:58] first swim with him and we went through
[28:00] a field of thousands of jellyfish and
[28:02] we're getting stung so that's certainly
[28:04] a consideration watch the Diana niad
[28:06] story on on Netflix if you want to know
[28:08] more about swimming in jellyfish took
[28:09] her out of the water three times uh the
[28:11] weather we had a paddle border with us
[28:14] that uh paddled right next to him so he
[28:16] could make sure that he was getting his
[28:18] water food he would bring all of his
[28:21] stuff to him I don't know if I can get
[28:22] this to to
[28:25] play oh maybe so we contacted a company
[28:29] yeah really cool so we estimated it's
[28:32] time leaving so the red dots are Ben
[28:34] leaving and this is uh the current at
[28:37] different times during the day so you
[28:38] can see that the current would help him
[28:40] in the beginning but now as the arrows
[28:41] are going in the opposite direction you
[28:42] can see that the current's working
[28:44] against him and as we get to warmer
[28:46] colors the current's even stronger so
[28:49] that's how we were able to try to figure
[28:51] out when he should try to leave and the
[28:52] gentleman who owns this company is
[28:54] absolutely incredible he does this a lot
[28:56] for sailing competition boers but then
[28:59] he sat down and did this with a with a
[29:01] couple of swimmers so we were able to
[29:03] look at this program and try to figure
[29:05] out when uh Ben should
[29:08] leave if I just go back to
[29:13] PowerPoint right here cool thanks
[29:22] oops so we obviously wanted to be
[29:25] careful in case anything went wrong I
[29:27] will tell you the first year we did this
[29:28] I felt like we were just a couple of
[29:30] kids hopping on a boat doing something
[29:32] stupid and then after he got really cold
[29:34] after sharks were in the water we
[29:36] realized we should probably get some
[29:38] like athletic trainers medical people
[29:40] involved and if we were doing a
[29:41] documentary and something went wrong it
[29:43] wouldn't be a good look for us so uh we
[29:46] contacted all of the different
[29:48] surrounding cities and towns police EMS
[29:51] fire we had a group meeting with all of
[29:53] them and we figured out all these
[29:55] different places that we would transport
[29:56] him in case of an emergency
[29:58] so um there's a map of that in another
[30:02] slide I'll tell you another issue that
[30:04] we had with the Block Island swim was
[30:06] the Coast Guard so this is a shipping
[30:08] channel right here so you have all these
[30:11] boats coming in that are actually
[30:12] carrying lots of vehicles into Newport
[30:15] so you have to be really careful when
[30:17] going through the shipping channels and
[30:18] we actually had to have the Coast Guard
[30:20] come out and guide us through the
[30:22] shipping channel the year we came back
[30:23] from Block Island and that's a couple
[30:25] months of paperwork to get clearance for
[30:27] that so we were trying to figure out if
[30:29] there was a way for us to bypass the
[30:31] shipping channels here's another
[30:32] shipping channel here um and because we
[30:35] were going through this shipping channel
[30:37] he ended up landing on this island here
[30:39] that's Jamestown um but since we went
[30:41] through the shipping channel at a
[30:42] certain point we didn't need paperwork
[30:44] we didn't need the Coast Guard um but
[30:46] that's certainly something to think
[30:47] about when you're getting out on the
[30:48] water for these big
[30:50] swims so this was the uh emergency
[30:53] action plan map that we gave out to all
[30:55] the police departments just to give them
[30:57] an idea of the ETA that he would show up
[30:59] at all these different spots and then
[31:00] the stars are the different docks and
[31:03] ports that we would bring him to we
[31:05] would call the EMS and say hey we have
[31:06] an emergency we had all these
[31:08] pre-planned we would tell them which one
[31:10] we were going to then they would already
[31:11] be there in an ambulance to go ahead and
[31:13] pick them up so that's what we kind of
[31:15] handed out to everyone during the
[31:18] journey so just some tech and materials
[31:20] we were using he was wearing a Garmin
[31:22] watch the entire time so that was giving
[31:24] us um his swim speed his heart rate
[31:28] he had an ingestible thermostat so we
[31:30] were looking at core temperature the
[31:33] interesting thing was the the core
[31:34] temperature device wasn't reading to our
[31:37] iPad because he was underwater and
[31:39] that's a huge problem that they have at
[31:41] USA swimming on the world stage is they
[31:44] want to track these swimmers in the
[31:46] water because you have had instances
[31:47] where people have died swimming Fran
[31:49] krippin was an athlete uh Team USA 2010
[31:52] died during a swimming race in Abu Dhabi
[31:55] and they didn't find his body until 2
[31:57] hours later in the water and the issue
[31:59] is when you have a GPS device and it
[32:01] goes underwater the signal is then lost
[32:04] um so technology still still needs to
[32:06] get to a point where that is fixed but
[32:09] we were losing that signal all the time
[32:11] so we weren't really able to accurately
[32:13] track his core temperature but the water
[32:14] was pretty warm so we weren't really
[32:16] worried about it we were actually more
[32:18] worried about the gentleman standing on
[32:19] the paddle board because he was in the
[32:20] direct sun the entire day and and not
[32:22] drinking that much but that's just some
[32:24] of the different technology we were
[32:25] using and then some of the stats so it
[32:28] took him a little over 14 hours to do
[32:30] the swim of straight swimming that's
[32:32] actually an aerial picture of Ben
[32:33] swimming with the paddle border right
[32:35] next to him so it took him just under 15
[32:38] hours he swam 41,000 yards his average
[32:41] pace was 2 minutes and 9 seconds per 100
[32:43] yards um that's how many strokes he took
[32:46] the average stroke rate which is around
[32:47] that reggae music kind of cool his
[32:49] average heart rate and he consumed
[32:51] almost 7.8 L of water so you think about
[32:54] a 2 L bottle of soda and what that
[32:57] visually looks like like that's a lot of
[32:58] water to be drinking when you're
[32:59] horizontal in the water and uh he
[33:02] consumed around
[33:04] 6,415 calories which was a mixture of
[33:06] peanut butter jelly sandwich there's his
[33:08] wife and his son and all of us uh
[33:10] measuring out and getting his food ready
[33:13] the day before so there are some things
[33:15] on his his weight pre and post so he
[33:17] lost a good amount of weight during the
[33:19] swim and uh he stayed pretty well
[33:22] hydrated which was which was
[33:24] great environmental so it was around 81
[33:27] .5 degre so it wasn't too bad out there
[33:29] a little windy it got super choppy so at
[33:31] one point we had 5 foot swells so he was
[33:34] swimming through 5 foot swells for quite
[33:36] a while um and then the the current was
[33:38] working against us for a very long time
[33:40] so there was one point where he didn't
[33:42] even make it 300 yards in over an hour
[33:44] so that psychologically was a little a
[33:46] little tough for him so there's his
[33:49] heart rate over the course of the swim
[33:51] we stopped him and fed him every 30
[33:53] minutes and then towards the end we were
[33:54] stopping um a little more often but you
[33:57] can just see the heart rate monitor was
[33:59] great with picking up how often uh he
[34:01] was he was stopping so there was some
[34:03] really good consistency there and then I
[34:06] think these are his laps with
[34:09] his Cadence so Cadence is just split in
[34:12] half a stroke rate so around 25 for one
[34:14] arm rotations per per minute and then
[34:16] his speed so we we had the current in
[34:18] our favor at the beginning and then this
[34:20] is when the current was was not in our
[34:23] favor and then as we got closer to
[34:24] Jamestown it was it was more so in our
[34:27] favor
[34:29] and then there's a a map of his his
[34:31] route there after he we uploaded the
[34:34] data and then his fastest so at one
[34:36] point he was swimming super fast when
[34:37] the current was in her favor 112 per 100
[34:40] yards which is incredibly
[34:43] fast and then there's his body
[34:45] temperature so you can see we gave him
[34:47] the the core device that he swallowed
[34:49] around 1:00 in the morning because we
[34:51] were afraid that if we gave it to him
[34:52] the night before he would pass it so we
[34:54] gave it to him that morning but his
[34:56] stomach actually didn't empty it into a
[34:59] small intestine so you can see every
[35:01] time he took a sip of water his uh
[35:04] temperature dropped down low so you
[35:05] could see every 30 minute Mark where the
[35:08] temperature was dropping and then the
[35:10] red mark is actually the paddle border
[35:12] so that was his temperature and it was
[35:14] consistent the entire time because I
[35:15] think he was standing up it passed
[35:17] whereas Ben he was horizontal so it
[35:19] never passed and then that night his
[35:22] temperature was above 101 degrees at
[35:25] some point so he actually had a fever
[35:26] sleeping
[35:28] overnight into the next morning so we
[35:30] thought that was really interesting that
[35:31] he had a fever that night into the next
[35:35] day and I think that's it I was worried
[35:38] that was going to go too long but was I
[35:40] fine perfect um so I think I'll just
[35:45] touch a little bit on data science I'm
[35:47] I'm doing some work down at Southern
[35:48] Connecticut State University right now
[35:50] and I'm working with their data science
[35:51] center there but where I'm finding it's
[35:54] really helpful is when we collect a lot
[35:56] of data in the lab lab it doesn't look
[35:58] as pretty and nice as this it takes a
[36:00] long time for it to look this pretty and
[36:02] nice so what the data science department
[36:04] there is helping us do is we have all
[36:06] these machines in the lab if we can
[36:08] automate the transport of the raw data
[36:11] and the database to A system that then
[36:14] does some type of machine learning to
[36:16] create these graphs so it doesn't take
[36:18] us as exercise scientists two weeks to
[36:20] go into Excel and create these graphs
[36:22] and then give them back as a product it
[36:24] saves us time and then we can start
[36:26] making money off of it as an actual
[36:27] retail business so we're working with
[36:30] that department to export the database
[36:33] off of these computers to then put it
[36:35] into graph form so that if someone comes
[36:38] into the lab and wants to know hey
[36:39] what's my you know V2 Max which is a
[36:43] metrics that we measure we do a test
[36:45] right afterwards instead of giving them
[36:47] a piece of paper from Excel that has all
[36:49] these crazy numbers it actually looks
[36:51] like a nice beautiful graph and we can
[36:52] give it that to them right away instead
[36:54] of upload loading the data going through
[36:57] equations making the pretty graphs and
[36:59] then giving them giving it to them two
[37:01] to three weeks later which is currently
[37:03] what what we're doing um but happy to
[37:07] take any questions on the swim or not
[37:10] really data science
[37:15] but I could try to answer a data science
[37:17] question but probably won't be pretty
[37:28] cool fine thank
[37:34] you definitely want to thank all our
[37:36] speakers maybe just one more round of
[37:38] applause this was a terrific so thank
[37:40] you very
[37:41] much this concludes our session I think
[37:44] now we'll have a poster session so you
[37:46] know please stick around for that and
[37:48] enjoy some of the sessions in the
[37:49] afternoon so thank you
