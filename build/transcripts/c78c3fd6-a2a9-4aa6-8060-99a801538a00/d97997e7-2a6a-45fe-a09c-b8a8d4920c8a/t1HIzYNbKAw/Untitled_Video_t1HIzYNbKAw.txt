[00:01] thank you very much uh I'm Neil Spencer
[00:04] I'm a statistics Professor here in the
[00:05] department and I'm here to welcome our
[00:08] second keyn note speaker for today uh
[00:10] we're going to have Professor Kristen
[00:12] Morgan uh Professor Morgan is an
[00:15] assistant professor of biomedical
[00:17] engineering here at University of
[00:18] Connecticut her work focuses on
[00:20] implementing in a let me see if I get
[00:23] this right implementing Innovative gate
[00:25] protocols and musos scal modeling to
[00:28] accelerate individuals reh abilitation
[00:30] and improve their longterm goals today
[00:33] she'll be speaking about an
[00:34] interdisciplinary datadriven approach to
[00:36] improve player recovery and performance
[00:40] uh yeah welcome you to the stage uh
[00:42] Professor Morgan
[01:20] shots up unting
[01:30] all righty well thank you for the kind
[01:32] introduction and and thank you for
[01:33] allowing me to be here today um I've
[01:35] been coming to this conference for many
[01:37] years so I think if you stick around
[01:38] long enough they invite you to speak all
[01:41] right so yeah like they said I'm going
[01:43] to be talking about uh interdisciplinary
[01:45] datadriven approach to improve player
[01:47] performance and
[01:49] recovery so in our lab we really focus
[01:51] mainly on lower extremity injuries uh
[01:54] specifically ACL injuries are interior
[01:56] cruciate ligament injuries um so not
[01:58] familiar if you're not famili with this
[02:00] about 250 to upwards about 400,000 ACL
[02:03] injuries occur every year about 1 point
[02:06] we spend about $ 1.5 billion do annually
[02:08] on just reconstruction Rehabilitation
[02:11] care uh so it's a very costly injury uh
[02:14] but one of the challenges is that about
[02:15] 44% of individuals fail to return back
[02:18] to their previously functional level so
[02:20] despite our best efforts we still don't
[02:21] really understand what's
[02:25] happening so when we think about these
[02:27] individuals who suffer from ACL injury
[02:29] often the results of this is that they
[02:31] have neuromuscular inhibition so are not
[02:33] able to kind of activate their muscles
[02:34] in the same way they were and this leads
[02:36] to some abnormal gate
[02:38] biomechanics and the result of that
[02:40] often is they lead to generating between
[02:42] Li
[02:44] asymmetry and they actually have
[02:45] elevated need loading and why this is
[02:47] problematic is we start to think about
[02:49] the individuals who have an ACL injury
[02:51] these people are going to be young like
[02:52] you all um in their early teen or late
[02:55] teens early 20s and one of the problems
[02:57] is we started to realize about 10 years
[02:59] after AC reconstruction people often
[03:01] develop NEOS arthritis so you're
[03:03] starting to realize that 10 years when
[03:05] you're in your 30s you're getting
[03:06] individuals who have needs of somebody
[03:07] much much older than they are so we
[03:10] really want to figure out ways to combat
[03:12] this so this is what our lab is kind of
[03:15] focused on our mission is to kind of
[03:16] figure out how can we better address
[03:18] this injury mechanism so one way we do
[03:21] this is we develop Innovative
[03:22] Rehabilitation protocols to Aid
[03:24] recovery the next is we're going to
[03:26] start to develop some novel metrics to
[03:28] kind of assess performance or assess
[03:31] performance and then third we want to
[03:33] actually start building some patient
[03:34] specific models to optimize
[03:39] performance so the first kind of thing
[03:41] we got into was looking at this uh
[03:43] purposely induced gaym asymmetry so what
[03:47] we found in individuals who have a
[03:48] poststroke uh who suffer from a stroke
[03:50] they often have neuromuscular inition
[03:52] that leads to between limb gate
[03:53] asymmetry now we recognize that a stroke
[03:55] and an ACL are two very different injury
[03:57] mechanisms so we're not kind of
[03:59] correlating that any way but we do
[04:01] recognize that this between between Li
[04:03] gate e symmetry is kind of is apparent
[04:05] in both populations so the idea was that
[04:08] we people found Ryman at all have shown
[04:10] that split belt asymmetric walking has
[04:13] been used to correct between Lim gate
[04:14] differences and so we kind of said well
[04:16] why don't we piggy back off of this a
[04:18] little bit so we do a lot of borrowing
[04:19] in our lab and we wanted to see well can
[04:22] we start to apply this asymmetric
[04:23] walking to the ACL population so if
[04:26] you're not familiar a split belt
[04:28] treadmill we were able to kind of
[04:30] independently um controlled each belt
[04:33] and so we can set one belt at one speed
[04:34] and one belt at another and we kind of
[04:37] perturb people to the best of our
[04:39] abilities so what Ryman has shown is
[04:41] that you actually if you appropriately
[04:43] apply this pertubation you can actually
[04:45] correct this between Lim asymmetry and
[04:47] so you'll notice then we have this
[04:48] pre-adaptation stage which is where
[04:50] they're asymmetric this gate adaptation
[04:52] where we kind of apply this perturbation
[04:54] it kind of shocks the system
[04:56] destabilizes them so it actually
[04:57] magnifies asymmetry initially but over
[04:59] time your body starts to realize wait
[05:01] there's something going on here we need
[05:02] to correct it and then you see that
[05:04] beautiful convergence down to symmetric
[05:06] gate we also recognize that you can't uh
[05:09] apply an asymmetric walk into somebody
[05:11] completely for the rest of their life so
[05:13] we do have to remove that perturbation
[05:14] but we want to see does it stay and so
[05:16] that last phase of post adaptation is is
[05:18] looking at that gate storage so once we
[05:21] apply this perturbation we want to say
[05:22] once we remove it are they going to
[05:23] store and what you'll notice is you see
[05:25] this negative after effect so again they
[05:27] they kind of the the system you know wax
[05:30] out a little bit and what you notice is
[05:32] that they kind of they have a negative
[05:34] after effect and that the gate symmetry
[05:35] goes in the opposite direction but then
[05:37] over time it actually gets back to the
[05:39] symmetric so it's a really neat kind of
[05:41] thing and so we said well again why
[05:42] don't we apply this to the ACL
[05:45] population that's what we did so we have
[05:49] um reduced between limb gate differences
[05:50] and so the goals of this work was to
[05:52] reduce between limb differences and then
[05:54] see if we could actually lead to the
[05:55] adoption and Stor of healthy gate and we
[05:58] of course used our split belt instrument
[06:00] of treadmill and we use a 05
[06:02] pertubation so we do have
[06:04] state-ofthe-art facilities uh we are
[06:06] located in gamle where the basketball
[06:08] teams play so we try to sneak into the
[06:10] games um but what you notice is that
[06:12] again we have our split belt treadmill
[06:14] we have a Vicon motion capture system
[06:17] and we work with a lot of other
[06:18] colleagues that allow us to have some
[06:19] really great um
[06:22] equipment so thinking about our
[06:24] asymmetric walking protocol uh we
[06:27] started off by getting a population of
[06:28] convenience and edly uh we have
[06:31] individuals about 15 individuals uh
[06:33] majority of them females and their time
[06:35] since surgery was about 4 years um a
[06:38] given take a couple of years and so
[06:40] here's our protocol where we have them
[06:42] do a f minute warm-up just to get
[06:43] acclimated to the treadmill if you've
[06:45] ever been on it it's very weird so you
[06:46] need that time to get acclimated uh then
[06:48] we have our Baseline walking at 1.0 and
[06:50] 1.5 me per
[06:53] second um then we have our first
[06:57] adaptation so when we were starting this
[06:58] out we had no idea what kind of one of
[07:00] the big things that's going to come out
[07:01] out is which way do you apply the
[07:03] perturbation because we had no idea at
[07:05] first we knew it was work but we had no
[07:06] idea which way would be the appropriate
[07:09] so we had a first adaptation where we
[07:10] had one limb at the let's say the right
[07:12] limb at the 1.5 speed and then we had
[07:15] them do the post adaptation I don't know
[07:17] if I should let them
[07:19] in why
[07:21] not all right more the marer um so we
[07:25] had him do a first uh adaptation and
[07:28] then we had a two-minute you know post
[07:29] adaptation of storage and then we have
[07:32] flipped the perturbation and had uh the
[07:34] now the left leg was going to go at the
[07:35] 1.5 meters per second and then we again
[07:38] followed up with a two-minute post
[07:45] adaptation all
[07:47] right so one of the big things about
[07:50] this is like we said we had to start to
[07:51] figure out well what asymmetry are we
[07:53] trying to correct and and how do we
[07:55] actually classify the limbs so what was
[07:57] interesting is one of the things on the
[07:59] in the lab is you notice that people get
[08:00] on the treadmill you can actually a lot
[08:02] of the things we're going to talk about
[08:03] are going to be very visual so often
[08:05] times you somebody comes in with an ACL
[08:06] injury and they come in they have a limp
[08:08] you can kind of see it sometimes when
[08:09] they get up on the treadmill so we had
[08:11] to start to figure out which limb do we
[08:12] actually set at which speed and one of
[08:14] the things that the lab came up with was
[08:16] looking at this overloaded versus
[08:17] underloaded Limb and so we started to
[08:19] care about loading rate asymmetry uh
[08:22] loading rate is just kind of how fast
[08:23] that force is applied to the limb
[08:25] especially in that kind of loading
[08:26] response phase so we decideed to say
[08:28] okay well which limb is going to be the
[08:29] overloaded and underloaded limb the
[08:31] overload limb is the one that has the
[08:32] faster loading higher loading rate and
[08:34] the underloaded limb is the one that has
[08:35] the lower loading
[08:37] rate and why this matters is because
[08:40] when we first started looking at the
[08:41] data we compared typically the
[08:42] reconstructed and non-reconstructed Limb
[08:45] and what we noticed is that there was no
[08:47] between lib differences but like we said
[08:49] visually we could see something so we
[08:50] said well what's what's going on there
[08:52] and that's why we looked at this
[08:53] overloaded and underloaded Limb and then
[08:56] it we teased out that there was that
[08:57] between limb difference that we were
[08:58] looking at so again this is telling us
[09:00] that it's not always the ne the
[09:02] reconstructed and non-reconstructed limb
[09:04] um and specifically remember that this
[09:06] population is about four years out and
[09:07] so we'll talk about why the
[09:08] reconstructed limb and non-reconstructed
[09:10] limb don't always Co inspi with the
[09:12] overloaded and
[09:14] underloaded so getting to the good stuff
[09:17] we were able to use this so the thing is
[09:19] we wanted to start apply this asymmetric
[09:21] walking and we want to see well does it
[09:23] restore uh between Lim G symmetry or
[09:25] gate symmetry sorry and so when we did
[09:28] this we have the 10-minute adaptation
[09:31] and so what we noticed is when we had
[09:33] the overloaded limit 1.5 or the
[09:34] underloaded limit 1.1 or 1.0 we saw that
[09:38] there was initial convergence to around
[09:40] four minutes however we were applying
[09:42] this pertubation for 10 minutes and we
[09:43] saw towards the end that it kind of
[09:45] diverged and so we were like well this
[09:46] isn't too bad we did get some
[09:48] convergence and maybe this is telling us
[09:49] that we only need to apply this for 10
[09:51] minutes
[09:53] right but we then looked at kind of our
[09:55] overloaded data when it was at 1.0 m/s
[09:58] and what we found there is that actually
[10:01] that over 10 minutes we saw this really
[10:02] beautiful convergence and at the end of
[10:04] the 10 minutes Mark they're right where
[10:05] we wanted them to be so this is very
[10:08] exciting because as anybody who knows
[10:09] with research it doesn't always uh go
[10:11] how's you
[10:12] plan so we said all right well this
[10:14] might be too good to be true we haven't
[10:16] we've they they work when we apply the
[10:17] perturbation but we don't know what
[10:19] happens when the perturbation is removed
[10:20] right so now we looked at this
[10:22] deadaptation and we said okay what
[10:24] happened in the 1.5 and again we saw
[10:27] that there was kind of that initial
[10:28] negative after effect and they started
[10:30] to kind of converge back to symmetric
[10:31] but they didn't quite get there below
[10:34] and behold we looked at our deadaptation
[10:36] when the overload limb was at 1.0 and we
[10:39] saw again that negative after effect but
[10:41] then around two minutes we got close to
[10:42] that zero a Between liim Difference so
[10:44] this was given us a lot of confidence
[10:47] and that what we were doing was correct
[10:48] and we're not harming any of these
[10:50] individuals so we had to have some stats
[10:53] since this is a stats conference um but
[10:55] one of the things we wanted to kind of
[10:57] point out is the fact that if you notice
[10:59] about this deadaptation when the one
[11:01] overloaded limb is at the 1.0 m/ second
[11:04] we find not only that they're more
[11:05] symmetric but so there's less a between
[11:07] limb difference especially at the
[11:09] two-minute mark But if you notice is
[11:11] that at the two-minute Mark the
[11:12] overloaded limb um has loading rates
[11:15] that are kind of comparable and even
[11:16] less than what they were during the
[11:18] symmetric so not only are we getting
[11:19] them to be kind of loading at the same
[11:21] um both limbs are the same but it's kind
[11:23] of actually going lower than what it was
[11:24] before so this is kind of a good thing
[11:27] it's a really good thing actually
[11:30] so the take home from this is that
[11:32] purposely induced asymmetric walking can
[11:35] reduce between limb gate asymmetry um
[11:39] especially when we have a 0 five
[11:41] difference uh we also saw that these
[11:43] individuals um exhibited short-term
[11:45] storage short-term storage um and so one
[11:48] of the things that we want to think take
[11:50] away from this is that yes this worked
[11:52] but it's really important to have this
[11:53] kind of limb classification looking at
[11:55] this overloaded versus underloaded limb
[11:57] is very important and also we want to
[11:59] start to figure out well how can we
[12:00] start to optimize this a little bit so
[12:02] right now we you know this perose before
[12:04] we had this population of convenience
[12:05] here about four years out now we're
[12:07] working on individuals who are within
[12:09] one year and so we're really changing a
[12:10] lot about what's the magnitude of the
[12:12] pertubation that's most important to
[12:13] them um and also kind of you know what
[12:16] is the duration of the perturbation so
[12:17] if you think about Tylenol and dosing
[12:19] it's like how many Tylenols do they get
[12:21] and how long should they be taking it so
[12:23] that's really what we're kind of going
[12:24] on from here and so this is kind of what
[12:26] we're doing when we talk about aiding in
[12:27] the recovery uh I know a lot of talks
[12:29] today we'll talk about recovery and
[12:31] probably in the short term but when we
[12:32] think about Rehabilitation it's more of
[12:33] a long-term
[12:36] recovery so the next thing we wanted to
[12:38] do was we said okay we got them to kind
[12:40] of we're eting this recovery can we
[12:42] start to assess their performance and so
[12:45] we wanted the goal of this was to kind
[12:46] of develop new metrics that have
[12:47] Universal ranges of healthy gate
[12:49] Dynamics and so this is where we kind of
[12:51] borrow again from statistics this time
[12:53] to see if we can get
[12:55] there and so a lot of this work started
[12:57] when we when I was at the University of
[13:00] Kentucky for a postc worked with Brian
[13:02] norn and what was really interesting is
[13:06] one of the things is they had a he works
[13:07] a lot with ACL injury ACL reconstruction
[13:09] patients so this is individual who's had
[13:11] an ACL reconstruction and what is
[13:14] interesting about this is they've been
[13:15] cleared to return back to sport now
[13:17] could you guess just based on looking at
[13:19] this what limb do you think is the
[13:20] reconstructed
[13:22] limb thoughts yeah yeah left one so I
[13:26] don't know your background you're not a
[13:28] clinician maybe but but yeah exactly
[13:29] give her a round of applause um so so
[13:32] yeah we're not clinicians but very
[13:34] obviously we can see that the ACL
[13:36] reconstructor limb is his front limb and
[13:38] again I repeat that this individual was
[13:40] asked to cleared to return back to Sport
[13:42] and we kind of already really noticed
[13:44] that maybe they shouldn't be and again
[13:45] I'm not a clinician I don't want to
[13:47] fault them um they're great we need them
[13:49] um so yeah so one of the things as we
[13:51] started talking about and this is a
[13:53] sports conference so I watch sports I
[13:55] don't play I'm retired um but one of the
[13:57] things that we notice is that
[13:59] um they always talk about the eye test
[14:01] right and so a lot of these things that
[14:02] we would get into lab we notice very
[14:04] visually there's a difference so we
[14:06] started saying well can we come up with
[14:07] metrics that only quantify these
[14:09] differences but again are very
[14:11] visual so that's going to be the theme
[14:13] of this section um and so we wanted to
[14:16] start again we talked about between
[14:18] limit symmetry between limb symmetry is
[14:19] very important um but we also want to
[14:21] get healthy ranges of gate uh so we
[14:24] started to look at things like a
[14:25] regression analysis and punk plots um
[14:28] and autor regressive modeling to see if
[14:29] we can actually kind of quantify and
[14:31] have some really nice visual metrics to
[14:33] assess
[14:35] performance and so again we're we're
[14:37] coming up with a performance dashboard
[14:39] this is just kind of our vision board
[14:40] for a performance dashboard um but again
[14:43] I think a lot of the ideas for this work
[14:44] is can we actually take some of these
[14:46] metrics and characterize certain aspects
[14:48] of movement so uh a couple of things
[14:51] that we're looking at right now is like
[14:52] this Force attenuation capacity and
[14:53] stress test assessments that I'll kind
[14:55] of talk to in a minute um but we're kind
[14:58] of branding some of the these these
[14:59] ratios and and metrics that we've come
[15:01] up
[15:02] with so when I talk about this Force
[15:05] attenuation capacity well when we start
[15:07] thinking about biomechanics and
[15:08] biomedical engineering they often model
[15:10] this um movement as a mass spring damper
[15:13] relationship and so from this we start
[15:17] to notice that when you have this model
[15:19] um some of the critical features of this
[15:21] model are the peak for or the
[15:22] accelerations and velocities right and
[15:24] so if those are the critical features we
[15:26] wanted to use metrics that actually can
[15:28] capture those critical featur features
[15:29] or or service somewhat of surrogates for
[15:31] this so we've looked at things like Peak
[15:33] force and loading rates to actually kind
[15:35] of talk about how individuals attenuate
[15:37] force and how they control their
[15:42] movement and so one of the things so in
[15:45] the previous work we talked about
[15:46] loading rate was a really big indicator
[15:48] of uh limb loading Dynamics and and kind
[15:50] of restoring healthy gate and so we
[15:52] wanted to say well can we kind of expand
[15:54] upon this so we started to see if we can
[15:55] look at that and exploit the
[15:57] relationship between Peak force and
[15:58] loting rate to kind of actually
[16:00] characterize uh motor
[16:02] control so we go back to our asymmetric
[16:06] walking population and what we found is
[16:09] again now we've we also collected some
[16:10] healthy controls they went through the
[16:12] same
[16:13] protocol and so what we wanted to do is
[16:16] we wanted to look at limb loading
[16:17] Dynamics in this population so what we
[16:19] did is we wanted to exploit the linear
[16:20] relationship between Peak force and
[16:22] loading rate and so what you know is
[16:24] very clearly the healthy individuals
[16:26] really fall within this linear region
[16:29] and then when we look at the overloaded
[16:30] and underloaded limb we start to see
[16:32] that they start to fall outside of this
[16:33] region right so again a very quick
[16:35] visual for us to understand um healthy
[16:37] and pathological movement so this is
[16:40] when they were doing kind of the
[16:41] symmetric
[16:42] trials and then when we had them do the
[16:44] asymetric walking protocol over time
[16:46] what we really like to see is that at
[16:48] first the overloaded limb was outside
[16:51] and then as they converged over the 10
[16:52] minutes both of the limbs fell inside
[16:54] the region and they overlapped so again
[16:56] a very great visual metric to see that
[16:58] we were getting the beautiful
[16:59] convergence that we wanted and again not
[17:01] only were they symmetric but they fell
[17:02] into the healthy range so um that was
[17:05] really
[17:07] exciting and so again we had to kind of
[17:09] figure out well that was during the
[17:10] perturbation how is this going to
[17:12] maintain after the perturbation and so
[17:14] we did our 10-minute de adaptation and
[17:16] behold we got most of these indiv to the
[17:19] healthy region so again this is the
[17:22] start of our kind of visual metrics that
[17:23] we're we're excited to kind of do the
[17:25] past the eye test right so this was all
[17:27] in Walking we ALS Al had some
[17:29] individuals who are doing some running
[17:31] and so what we did is again we plotted
[17:32] our healthy
[17:34] controls we defined our region of
[17:36] healthy
[17:38] Dynamics and then we placed our po aclr
[17:41] individuals on top of that they fell
[17:42] outside this range so again this is
[17:44] telling us another really nice way to
[17:46] kind of delineate between healthy and
[17:48] pathological gate and what's really
[17:50] important about this is we like the fact
[17:52] that if we can conr with a region of
[17:53] healthy Dynamics when you're kind of
[17:55] going like a larger um study you know if
[17:58] we have have somebody who's going to
[17:59] come in the lab and we just need to do a
[18:00] quick gate assessment once we have this
[18:02] region of healthy Dynamics we don't need
[18:04] to kind of continue to collect a whole
[18:05] another bunch of ACL individuals to
[18:07] compare it to we just see where do you
[18:08] fall in the plot and go from there uh so
[18:11] we kind of Envision this as maybe
[18:13] looking at thinking about it as a BMI
[18:14] indexes if we can kind of extend this
[18:16] out and see how far are you away from
[18:18] this kind of linear line and this region
[18:20] of healthy Dynamics and start to kind of
[18:22] figure out what this means about your
[18:23] motor
[18:27] function so again like we said we wanted
[18:29] to exploit this linear relationship and
[18:31] we were able to successfully do this and
[18:33] and and it really tied in nicely to our
[18:35] previous
[18:36] work so we kind of said let's push our
[18:38] luck a little bit let's see if we can
[18:39] carry on and find some other metrics
[18:41] that can um explain some of these things
[18:43] so again we started looking at this
[18:46] relationship this is again looking more
[18:47] at running and we looked at um in
[18:49] running the two big Peaks are impact and
[18:51] active Peaks and so we want to see well
[18:53] can we create this ratio of active to
[18:55] impact Peak to evaluate force and
[18:57] attenuation in motor control during
[19:00] running and we did this because of the
[19:02] success of our previous work and a lot
[19:04] of these again metrics came from
[19:06] conversations we had with physical
[19:07] therapists so a lot of times I would
[19:09] come to Brian I say I have this great
[19:10] metric you know can we use it and he's
[19:11] like this would never be applied in the
[19:13] clinic so I think this was helpful for
[19:15] us to understand is that sometimes you
[19:17] can come up with a great metric but it
[19:18] needs to be interpretable and it needs
[19:20] to be able to be easily implemented
[19:21] right and so what he did say though is
[19:23] he goes well we really want when we talk
[19:26] to some of the clinicians and doctors
[19:27] they want a red yellow green light
[19:29] metric right so we want to be able to
[19:30] say very quickly um green are they
[19:32] cleared to go yellow they need to be
[19:34] hold and red uh there's a clear no-go so
[19:37] that was kind of the the impetus for
[19:38] this work and again we looked at this
[19:41] active to impact Peak ratio again we got
[19:43] this beautiful relationship between the
[19:45] two again our ACLS are on the right and
[19:47] they fell outside of this region so this
[19:49] was very very
[19:52] exciting but then we also kind of want
[19:54] to say all right well this is
[19:56] great but we still haven't had a red
[19:59] yellow green light
[20:02] right so what we want to do is we want
[20:05] to say specifically with the individuals
[20:06] when we think about this red yellow
[20:07] green light it's going to be like a
[20:08] return to sport metric right so we
[20:11] decided to implement a logistic
[20:13] regression model right so we applied a
[20:15] lisc regression looking at the Active
[20:17] impact Peak ratio and then looking at
[20:19] probability of healthy limb performance
[20:21] and so again when we started to think
[20:23] back you know a lot of times in
[20:24] literature we have um when we think
[20:26] about limb symmetry indices they talk
[20:28] about point n or greater is a gun of
[20:30] good metric so we started to figure out
[20:31] well what is the probability of a
[20:32] healthy limb performance at 0. n or
[20:34] above and so that was going to give us
[20:36] our range for green um the ones between
[20:39] 75 and 09 were giv us our range for
[20:41] yellow and then our probability for less
[20:44] than 75 was kind of our red noo so this
[20:46] is what we liked about this active to
[20:48] impact Peak is the logistic regression
[20:50] was really beautiful and allowing us to
[20:51] kind of create this red yellow and
[20:55] green so we also started to figure out
[20:58] well you know we had one metric and
[21:00] again I continue to say we get greedy we
[21:01] looked at this um late to Mid knee
[21:04] flexion Peak so if you again look at the
[21:06] knee flexion angles during running uh
[21:08] and looking at the late to mid peak
[21:10] flexion we actually again created
[21:12] another logistic aggression out of this
[21:13] and then we created our red yellow and
[21:15] green metrics for these so again what's
[21:17] nice about both of these is again once
[21:19] we have this metric or we have this
[21:20] model we can apply individual apply
[21:23] individuals one at a time and get that
[21:25] information back
[21:26] out and so one of the final things we
[21:29] did is said well let's see how well
[21:31] these two together kind of are able to
[21:33] classify or differentiate between the
[21:34] healthy and post ACR individuals and
[21:37] what we got is again there's always one
[21:39] person who messes it up but for the most
[21:41] part we got some really strong uh
[21:43] differentiation between using these two
[21:45] metrics and so again moving forward we
[21:47] like to kind of continue to collect more
[21:48] data to make sure that this holds um but
[21:50] this is a really nice thing that gave us
[21:52] a lot of visual confidence to make sure
[21:53] that we know these metrics are are
[21:55] performing
[21:57] well so again those were kind of our
[21:59] Force attenuation two metrics we had the
[22:02] active and impact Peak uh the late to
[22:04] mid peak knee flexion and the force vers
[22:06] loading rate and so we wanted to get
[22:08] into our stress test right so you know
[22:10] again this is more branding than
[22:11] anything um but we want to do stress
[22:13] test we want to see how the system
[22:15] performs when it's under different types
[22:16] of loading conditions right so again we
[22:18] start to look at like walking and we
[22:20] have uh walking at you know the 1.0 and
[22:22] the 1.5 conditions and so what we've
[22:25] talked about here and I think one of the
[22:26] the previous speaker talking about about
[22:27] the idea of gate variability or the
[22:29] variability in movement and so one of
[22:31] the things we know is gate variability
[22:33] is a really big in delineating between
[22:35] healthy and pathological gate and
[22:37] individuals in our field and so we use
[22:39] these Pon car plots again I'm not French
[22:42] but I'm trying um and so what they're
[22:44] able to do is we kind of they actually
[22:47] were coming out of heart rate
[22:48] variability um so they're usually
[22:50] typically measuring beatto beat Dynamics
[22:52] and so we said we don't have beat to
[22:54] beat but we do have stride to stride and
[22:56] so that's what we were doing there is we
[22:57] wanted to kind see if we can model the
[23:00] the variability and their
[23:01] movement and again this was nice because
[23:04] the sd1 and sd2 metrics allowed us to
[23:06] characterize the short and long-term um
[23:09] adaptations and variabilities in
[23:10] individuals during this
[23:12] walking so again we took our our famous
[23:15] uh
[23:16] population and we really start started
[23:18] looking at this in the Baseline walking
[23:20] speeds and so again we have our slow
[23:23] which is kind of our kind of our
[23:24] Baseline relaxed and then we have our
[23:25] fast walking which is kind of our stress
[23:27] test condition
[23:29] right and so very quickly what we'll
[23:32] show is that when we have the healthy
[23:35] control limbs uh we have the underloaded
[23:38] limb and the overloaded limb and when we
[23:40] look at the 1.0 MERS per second we see
[23:43] that there was actually a little
[23:44] variability difference between the three
[23:45] groups which wasn't exciting um but it
[23:49] it was what it was sometimes your
[23:50] results are not exciting but then we
[23:52] thought about it the 1.0 it's kind of
[23:53] like when you're walking into class this
[23:55] is not a stressful condition uh so we
[23:57] figure that any kind of abnormalities or
[23:59] neuromuscular impairments would be Mass
[24:01] probably at this condition so he said
[24:03] well let's go from there and see what
[24:04] happens at
[24:06] 1.5 and lo and behold at 1.5 we got what
[24:09] we're looking for so on the right we see
[24:11] the overloaded limb and we see this very
[24:13] much of an explosion of variability as
[24:15] we like to say and so when we thought
[24:17] about it we said a 1.5 um these
[24:20] individuals who had this overloaded limb
[24:21] that we know has is suffering from
[24:23] neuromuscular inhibition we saw very
[24:25] quickly um that they were unable to kind
[24:27] of maintain
[24:28] their Dynamics at this faster speed so
[24:31] again when we think about a heart rate
[24:32] stress test when they really put place
[24:34] at you and have you running at these
[24:35] higher speeds for a prolonged period
[24:37] your system and any failures in the
[24:39] system are going to be really pronounced
[24:40] and so it was nice that we were able to
[24:42] capture that
[24:47] here okay and so then our stats were
[24:50] just confirming that yes the overloaded
[24:52] limb uh variability both the sd1 and st2
[24:56] sd2 were significantly different and the
[24:58] healthy controls in the underloaded limb
[25:00] during this 1.5 m/s
[25:06] condition and again just highlighting
[25:08] that under these stressful conditions
[25:10] any under underlying neuromuscular
[25:12] dysfunction became really
[25:14] prevalent and then one of our last kind
[25:17] of metrics under this um stress test
[25:20] condition so we talked about stress test
[25:22] we talked about neuromuscular stress
[25:23] tests really um but we're also starting
[25:25] to think about cognitive stress tests so
[25:26] in our lab we started to work with
[25:28] individuals who have different levels of
[25:29] cognitive impairment and what's been
[25:32] interesting about that is um you know
[25:34] coming through the research from this
[25:35] they start talking about uh individuals
[25:38] with who have cognitive impairment their
[25:40] gate displays hidden and unexpected
[25:41] fractal properties and what we really
[25:43] interpreted this is that there's
[25:45] underlying um patterns in the data right
[25:48] so underlying unexpected patterns in the
[25:50] data and so we really want to start to
[25:51] figure out how can we kind of capture
[25:53] these underlying Dynamics specifically
[25:55] to kind of test about cognitive
[25:56] impairment and you're wondering why do
[25:58] we care about cognitive impairment in
[26:00] sports and so again some of the
[26:01] individuals will talk about are very
[26:03] severely have cognitive impairment but
[26:05] other level of cognitive impairment you
[26:06] think about somebody who's suffering
[26:07] from a concussion right that's going to
[26:09] be a level of cognitive impairment so we
[26:11] want to see how can we transfer some of
[26:13] these kind of um these time varying
[26:15] measures of gate variability to detect
[26:17] these changes in cognitive impairment
[26:19] and function and so again we started to
[26:22] use autoaggressive modeling we use a
[26:23] second order AR modeling so again
[26:25] thinking about when it was a good model
[26:27] fit but also know second order AR models
[26:29] you can take the ar1 coefficient and the
[26:31] ar2 coefficient plot them against each
[26:33] other and it creates a very nice visual
[26:35] and so that's what we decided to do
[26:37] there and so what we did is again like
[26:39] the previous one we took their stride
[26:40] time Dynamics and we plotted the ar2
[26:43] model to them and so we were fortunate
[26:45] to have 13 individuals who performed a
[26:47] single and dual task walking so single
[26:49] walking is just walking um at the 1.25
[26:52] meters per second just normal walking
[26:54] and then dual task is when you're
[26:55] walking and kind of think about walking
[26:57] and chewing gum right it's hard to do
[26:58] two things at once so we had them
[27:00] walking and do a Serial sevens task
[27:02] where they're given a number then they
[27:03] have to count backwards by seven and so
[27:05] you increasing your cognitive load to
[27:07] have to be able to do this so again we
[27:09] had this healthy population and we had
[27:12] him do a single task walking we fit
[27:14] their AR model coefficients to it and
[27:16] that's where they resided in this this
[27:18] model and then we said well what's going
[27:20] on with the Dual task and we started to
[27:23] see in
[27:24] this uh well within like a few minutes
[27:27] so it wasn't like we came day they did
[27:29] it one day and then came back another
[27:30] day we saw a shift in what their gate
[27:32] Dynamics were doing so it was kind of
[27:34] interesting to see that there was an
[27:35] increase and taxing on their cognitive
[27:37] load and function that we could we could
[27:39] actually detect from their motor
[27:41] function and so again these are kind of
[27:44] the two regions that we want to think
[27:45] about so again I talked about how this
[27:47] kind of work started from some of the
[27:49] Cog work we were looking at in
[27:51] populational cognitive impairment and so
[27:53] what's really significant about these is
[27:54] when you see the blue is kind of this
[27:56] healthy region for this population and
[27:58] the pink is this healthy region or the
[28:00] region for the individuals who had the
[28:02] cognitive um impairment or cognitive
[28:04] impairment but they're doing the Dual
[28:05] task so like we said we've done this
[28:07] work in some other populations
[28:10] before and what was interesting about
[28:13] that is we've noticed that individuals
[28:15] who had neuromuscular impairment and
[28:17] again continual stride time their stride
[28:20] times resided in that outward region of
[28:22] the AR triangle we had the individuals a
[28:25] healthy control were in that blue region
[28:26] and then the individuals with the
[28:28] impairment were in the pink and what was
[28:30] really interesting for us to note is
[28:32] that the individuals in the blue and
[28:35] pink really kind of corresponded to what
[28:36] we saw when we had the Dual task so
[28:38] again this is telling us that there
[28:39] might be some specific regions
[28:41] associated with not only cognitive
[28:43] impairment healthy control but then we
[28:45] also picked up the individuals with
[28:46] neuromuscular impairment and so again we
[28:48] like this idea is that maybe we can use
[28:50] this triangle to identify where people
[28:51] based on where you reside we can
[28:53] actually kind of uh understand what your
[28:56] uh level function is
[28:58] or what your kind of injury type is and
[29:01] so again we've done this again in people
[29:03] who have ALS and huntingtons and
[29:04] controls we looked at the ar1 ar2 and
[29:07] their means dry
[29:10] time we bootstrap their data and then we
[29:13] got some really nice kind of clustering
[29:15] between the three groups and so what we
[29:16] like about this is that you know again
[29:18] you might start the controls however
[29:20] depending on what kind of neur muscular
[29:22] or neuro um cognitive impairment you
[29:24] have we can actually track that movement
[29:28] so again in a function of time we've
[29:30] actually done some work in sports tasks
[29:32] so this is again we've done some work
[29:33] with uh University of Western Australia
[29:35] and University of Tennessee uh for my
[29:37] PhD and where we looked at athletes and
[29:40] we were able to kind of use this open
[29:41] SIM computational modeling and allows us
[29:43] to create you know subject specific
[29:45] simulations of individuals which is
[29:47] really nice and what's nice about this
[29:48] is we can get out information about
[29:50] muscle function and Joint loading that
[29:52] you really can't measure in the lab
[29:53] right now so again we did this jump
[29:56] Landing task
[29:58] and the result of this is we were able
[30:00] to kind of generate simulations of these
[30:02] individuals and get out their muscle
[30:04] function right and so this is kind of
[30:06] cool when you think about you know
[30:07] athletes and things like this was is a
[30:08] jump loading task but and you know now
[30:11] the previous week was talking about the
[30:12] amount of um motion capture systems that
[30:14] you can create now we can take this
[30:16] information and understand what their
[30:18] muscles and joints are doing at the same
[30:20] time but more importantly the last two
[30:22] slides we have is talking about
[30:23] performance optimization so again
[30:25] thinking about the audience today in the
[30:27] sports Analytics
[30:28] uh our collaborators have used this to
[30:30] kind of do performance optimization
[30:31] where we take a movement and see can we
[30:33] actually how do we kind of change your
[30:35] movement bi a mechanics to reduce the
[30:36] loading on your joints uh so that's one
[30:38] of the works that they're
[30:40] doing um one of the things we started
[30:42] looking at in our lab is kind of
[30:43] performance optimization with respect to
[30:45] reducing knee loading and so one of the
[30:47] things we have is we again we took some
[30:49] of our population from the individuals
[30:50] who are doing that asymmetric walking
[30:53] and you know again we talked about
[30:54] reducing knee loading is a major factor
[30:56] in this so we've done this where we've
[30:58] applied our performance our optimization
[30:59] routine criteria we have the
[31:02] before and after and you can kind of see
[31:04] the Divergence between the two models
[31:06] showing that the different strategies
[31:07] that they're taking and what's been
[31:09] really interesting to
[31:11] see is that both pre and
[31:13] postoptimization we were able to reduce
[31:15] knee loing by 20% so again this is how
[31:18] we kind of plan to take all that
[31:19] information we've had and start to use
[31:21] it to kind of apply performance
[31:22] optimization and optimizing people's
[31:26] movement so again here's a summary of
[31:28] our three goals I want to thank our
[31:30] students some of which are here today uh
[31:32] for the work uh help on this work our
[31:35] funding agencies because we couldn't do
[31:36] any of this without
[31:37] them and I would happy to take any
[31:40] questions
[32:02] yeah great question so you're asking
[32:03] about have we looked into if there's any
[32:05] long-term storage um not yet so you know
[32:09] again we it's a that's the long-term
[32:10] goal and so you know that's what we tell
[32:12] the funding agencies give us more money
[32:13] to investigate this um but yeah I think
[32:17] right now the bigger isue you're seeing
[32:19] like which is the optimal perturbation
[32:20] what is the the the duration of this but
[32:22] absolutely that's going to one of the
[32:24] things we want to see and and talking
[32:25] with some other people we also want to
[32:26] figure out we only see them in the lab
[32:29] we'd love to be able to put a foot
[32:30] sensor in them have them walk around the
[32:31] world and see you know truly get that
[32:33] long-term storage so that's the goal and
[32:36] you know help us get funding for that
[32:37] right
[32:40] thanks
[32:51] yeah so we do have that information we
[32:54] haven't necessarily teased out what you
[32:57] know how how the those people are
[32:58] looking but we have had a handful of
[32:59] people who had um multiple
[33:01] reconstructions on one limb and then
[33:02] both of them had like on each limb um so
[33:05] that's something that you're right we
[33:06] have to kind of tease up and figure out
[33:07] where do they fall within this Paradigm
[33:09] and and what's going on with them but um
[33:11] but like you're you're highlighting the
[33:12] fact is unfortunately if you have one
[33:14] you're more likely to have a secondary
[33:15] one yeah yes
[33:37] yeah so you're talking about like yeah
[33:38] what how is that going to be taxing it
[33:40] absolutely could um and and we don't
[33:43] know so you like you said this is kind
[33:44] of the first hot off the presses we're
[33:46] seeing like we can actually te detect
[33:48] this and so maybe the idea is like can
[33:50] we figure out a way to you know train
[33:52] people that when they're going to do
[33:54] this that they're they're going to be
[33:55] able to maintain their their gate
[33:56] Dynamics but yeah a great point and kind
[33:58] of interesting and challenging at the
[34:00] same time yeah
[34:11] yes oh
[34:13] so that's a complicated question um yeah
[34:17] we would love to do that so we haven't
[34:19] necessar we we've done a little bit of
[34:21] that work um but not enough to kind of
[34:24] give you the answer to that but um but
[34:26] yeah no exactly because like you said
[34:28] you you really do want this Baseline on
[34:30] individuals to then when when something
[34:32] happens know how much are they actually
[34:33] deviating from where they were before
[34:35] you know it's we always see them
[34:36] afterwards so we'd love to kind of get
[34:37] this information we'd love to screen
[34:38] everybody in the world get their
[34:40] Baseline and then get like you know like
[34:42] you said look at it afterwards see how
[34:43] it
[34:51] effects that is our I I always talk
[34:53] about that instrumented tremble is my
[34:55] baby I don't have kids that is my kid um
[34:58] so yeah we we use it for everything and
[35:00] and so one of the goals is it's it's a
[35:01] great piece of Machinery but it's it's
[35:03] huge it's not portable and so that's why
[35:06] we really want to get into wearables
[35:07] that are going to be able to measure the
[35:08] same information out in the real world
[35:11] um to get us but yeah the force plates
[35:12] are gold yeah yep okay last one
[35:46] yeah so do they undergo what we do um I
[35:48] don't know but I'll say they should um
[35:50] no you know I I I don't know so it's
[35:53] it's it's going to be interesting it
[35:54] would be lovely to work with a group
[35:55] like that and see how their work is
[35:57] similar and what we can learn from each
[35:58] other but yeah I don't have that Insider
[36:00] information maybe I'll get it
[36:02] today right well I think I'm out of time
[36:05] but thank you very much um fa soon
