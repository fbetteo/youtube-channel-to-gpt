[01:16] 29 2018 through 2020
[01:19] so please welcome justin jacobs and he's
[01:23] going to be presenting on a square
[01:25] integrable methodology into play
[01:27] registration for nba tracking data
[01:34] all right thank you um so there will be
[01:36] an exam on everything that was just said
[01:39] so uh i hope you're all paying attention
[01:42] um
[01:43] so uh thanks for thanks for having me um
[01:46] early this morning um
[01:48] i kind of wanted to give
[01:51] insight of how we think about what can
[01:54] seem like really complex ideas in
[01:56] statistics uh show how they apply to
[01:59] problems and then extract out the what's
[02:01] really going on um
[02:04] and the uh the the core component here
[02:07] is to
[02:08] uh kind of show you the actual mechanics
[02:11] of it so this is going to be a little
[02:13] bit of an academic lecture uh so
[02:15] apologies in advance um
[02:18] but don't be intimidated i will show
[02:21] as much as humanly possible each step so
[02:24] we're going to go pretty slow
[02:26] but i want to show you something really
[02:27] cool
[02:29] let's see here which way can i do this
[02:32] there we go
[02:33] all right so um
[02:35] what we're going to do is we're going to
[02:36] start with a non-sports example so
[02:38] at the end of this story i want you to
[02:41] think a keep reminding yourself of this
[02:43] non-sports example because this
[02:44] non-sports example is going to carry out
[02:46] through the entire theme even though we
[02:48] might seem to deviate quite a ways away
[02:51] and um if you know uh if you know a
[02:54] little bit about me huge marx brothers
[02:56] fans you're going to see a bunch of
[02:57] markzware's quotes as we go through
[02:59] um
[03:00] the non-sports example is going to be
[03:02] dealing with like facial recognition so
[03:04] you know grouch mark says i never forget
[03:06] a face but in your case i'll be glad to
[03:07] make an exception
[03:10] and what we're going to talk about here
[03:11] is iris scanning and registration
[03:14] so i'm not sure if you know this but
[03:17] your iris is actually like a snowflake
[03:19] it effectively builds a unique bar code
[03:22] to identify who you are
[03:24] and um what happens is when you're born
[03:26] as a baby and when you come out as a
[03:28] baby your rods and cones haven't quite
[03:30] formed fully and over those first three
[03:33] months they start to fracture and break
[03:35] and that's what builds this unique
[03:36] pattern
[03:38] so
[03:38] let's suppose there's a situation where
[03:40] you're a child who's just gone through
[03:42] this process couple years into your life
[03:45] you're abducted and then you disappear
[03:47] uh off the face of the earth effectively
[03:49] right so it's not like you're abducted
[03:50] and they say oh you're somewhere in the
[03:51] neighborhood like you're just gone
[03:52] there's 30 years that pass
[03:54] how do we still keep finding these these
[03:56] folks that have been missing
[03:58] this is actually a methodology that we
[04:00] came up with uh that would
[04:03] that actually does find people in the
[04:04] wild so we can use the irises to extract
[04:08] out those barcodes and then say are you
[04:09] a match so since this process ends three
[04:12] months in if i have a photo of you at
[04:14] two years old and then all of a sudden i
[04:17] see a photo of you pop up online in some
[04:19] general repository i can run this
[04:21] algorithm extract out the barcode and
[04:24] see whether or not you're that person
[04:26] and it's it's pretty amazing that we can
[04:28] actually do this and and find missing
[04:30] children
[04:31] um so for example here if you can see i
[04:33] get over here um can you guys see my
[04:35] mouse
[04:36] if anyone wants to hop on
[04:40] uh yes we can see your mouse awesome
[04:42] great
[04:43] so
[04:44] what we do here is we uh have an edge
[04:46] detection algorithm um that's outside of
[04:48] the point here of what we're going to
[04:50] look at but we have an edge detection
[04:51] algorithm that says all right here's the
[04:52] iris
[04:53] and we're going to take this little area
[04:55] in between right the actual iris and
[04:57] then we're going to unravel it and then
[04:59] run
[04:59] math magic over it and we're going to
[05:01] extract out effectively this barcode
[05:03] which is in the upper left corner
[05:06] and that's what's going to be that
[05:07] registration
[05:08] or that that's that scan that we can use
[05:10] for registration
[05:12] so once we have a collection of barcodes
[05:14] we can actually run them over each other
[05:17] and uh compute the hamming distance so
[05:19] when i say run them over each other um
[05:22] wherever you're going to slice because
[05:23] it's circular wherever you're going to
[05:24] slice that's going to be the left end
[05:26] point
[05:26] um and we want to do that left
[05:28] endpoint's actually the same everywhere
[05:32] the easiest way to explain it is if
[05:34] you're faced on the slice let's say it
[05:36] goes down but if you're tilted slightly
[05:38] you're the slice is no longer down it's
[05:40] off to the side so what we do is we'll
[05:42] take the barcode and just slide it
[05:43] across and compute hamming distance
[05:45] when we do that we're going to get a
[05:46] number of pixels that match in this case
[05:49] so this distribution we actually get
[05:51] like this this bimodal distribution that
[05:53] pops out this left-hand distribution is
[05:56] the probability of a non-match and most
[05:58] people don't match because they're all
[06:00] everyone's got you know their their own
[06:02] unique barcodes in fact most people have
[06:04] two uh barcodes and those barcodes don't
[06:07] even match your left and i right eyes
[06:08] don't match either
[06:10] we're going to have a very hot spot but
[06:11] we actually see this like 0.8 region
[06:14] kind of pop out so the x axis here is
[06:17] the percentage of bits that match and
[06:19] the y-axis is the resolution of the
[06:21] photo and as the worst resolution occurs
[06:25] you see the probability of matching kind
[06:27] of get worse and worse which is kind of
[06:28] what we expect
[06:30] but if we get some pretty nice
[06:31] resolution photos we get a really nice
[06:33] separation boundary
[06:35] so we developed this back in uh 2011 i
[06:38] say mcgarvey at all i'm part of the at
[06:40] all in this situation
[06:42] building these distributions out and
[06:44] ensuring the robustness of the filters
[06:47] we were able to apply apply this into
[06:49] the national center for missing
[06:50] exploited children and this algorithm
[06:52] has been off and running and doing
[06:53] fantastic stuff
[06:56] so if i put this process together
[06:59] what i've done here is i've taken an
[07:01] iris and i apologize if you're creeped
[07:03] out by eyes um
[07:05] but i take the iris i do an unwrapping
[07:08] and here's where i did that segmentation
[07:10] so this is the actual picture of the
[07:11] iris
[07:12] and then i run this filter over it this
[07:14] is what's called a gabor filter and i i
[07:17] don't want to like stress you guys out
[07:18] about this i just want to show you what
[07:20] the pictures look like but it's a
[07:21] particular filter that tries to look for
[07:24] the relationships and frequencies but
[07:26] between the grayscale components of the
[07:28] iris
[07:30] and those relationships those hard
[07:33] shifts in the grayscale components um
[07:36] ones that should be separated greatly do
[07:38] get separated some that are that are
[07:40] kind of off will get lumped together um
[07:42] think of it kind of as like a as like a
[07:44] weird sigmoid like the sigmoid tries to
[07:47] push out uh
[07:49] far away components and pull in closer
[07:51] close components meaning if i have a
[07:52] grayscale value of like 200 versus 205
[07:55] they'll kind of get together and then a
[07:57] very a value of like 105 versus 210
[08:00] they'll push them farther out
[08:01] but here i don't want to just do that
[08:03] and this is why i said it's a weird
[08:05] sigmoid what i want to do is i want to
[08:07] look not just for
[08:09] jumps that kind of get closer and
[08:10] farther away but i also want to look at
[08:11] some where i might want to pull them
[08:13] together that are farther away meaning
[08:14] that uh if i look at two to three pixel
[08:18] segments and even though i have a 205
[08:20] and 210 next to each other that 205
[08:22] might be linked to a couple 100s and
[08:24] that 210 might be linked to a couple
[08:26] 200s and now i want to push those far
[08:28] away so it's kind of doing this
[08:30] multi-layering effect and that's what
[08:32] helps build this barcode and then we
[08:34] just run hamming distance
[08:36] so
[08:37] it ends up being an incredibly simple
[08:39] algorithm because all you do is is
[08:42] extract out the image that's kind of the
[08:44] little hard part but you extract out the
[08:46] image you unwrap it you convert to
[08:48] grayscale you run a gabor filter which
[08:50] is a function call and some parameter
[08:52] tuning and you run a hamming distance
[08:55] um so the question is like could we do
[08:58] something similar for this because we've
[08:59] seen this work very effectively for
[09:01] registration of children
[09:03] uh or even adults um could we see if
[09:06] this works in the um
[09:08] in the sports world
[09:10] so what we're going to do is we're going
[09:11] to try and build
[09:13] instead of using a gabor filter right
[09:14] away because
[09:16] you guys don't know what a gabor filter
[09:17] is and i can't tell you easily what a
[09:19] good war filter is so i think all of us
[09:21] are at a loss for trying to use it so
[09:23] let's try to build up a methodology that
[09:25] makes sense so that when we do get
[09:28] matches we can start to explain why does
[09:29] this match
[09:31] the google filter doesn't really give
[09:32] you that it just tells you it is a match
[09:35] so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
[09:36] start with the frequency space
[09:38] and um the quote here is you pay us a
[09:41] little we'll be a little tough but if
[09:42] you pay us a lot we'll be a lot tough
[09:44] and it's a chico marks quote um
[09:47] the idea here is that if you put a
[09:50] little bit of effort into the frequency
[09:52] uh decomposition algorithm you're going
[09:54] to get a little bit of help you're going
[09:56] to be able to represent that function a
[09:58] little bit but if you put a lot of
[09:59] effort into the frequency decomposition
[10:02] algorithm you're going to get a lot of a
[10:04] lot of power
[10:05] so
[10:06] if you're familiar with the fourier
[10:08] series then you've already got a leg up
[10:10] but if you're not uh we're you're going
[10:12] to learn some things today
[10:14] so we're going to start with a simple
[10:15] numerical analysis example um
[10:18] what we're going to do is we're going to
[10:19] take a function f and i'm going to
[10:20] convert this to s i'm using saying s for
[10:22] signal but we're going to have this
[10:24] function little f
[10:25] and this functional f is going to be our
[10:28] route that's being run whether it is
[10:31] football or hockey or basketball if we
[10:33] have tracking data you have routes
[10:36] and what we want to do is uh take this f
[10:39] of x and we want to represent it in some
[10:42] frequency space which we're going to
[10:43] call like big f okay so we're going to
[10:45] transform this collection of track paths
[10:48] and convert to some fundamental
[10:50] frequency
[10:52] so
[10:53] the way we're going to do that that
[10:54] nasty looking integral is we're going to
[10:56] do it by example um
[10:59] we're going to
[11:00] sensitive there we go
[11:03] what we're going to do is uh we're going
[11:04] to take this function here and let's
[11:06] suppose uh for the sake of argument uh
[11:09] we are looking at a little league game
[11:11] that has tracking data and here's a kid
[11:12] who's just literally running serpentine
[11:15] uh down the field
[11:16] um i picked this function we're gonna
[11:19] we're going to cheat a lot today because
[11:22] i want to show you the mechanics and
[11:23] we'll discuss in the real world how this
[11:25] really works
[11:26] but let's suppose we can represent the
[11:28] serpentine route as 3 times cosine plus
[11:30] 10 times sine with a frequency of 7
[11:33] minus 3 times cosine of the frequency of
[11:35] 11. that's going to be our signal in the
[11:37] real world we don't know this we just we
[11:39] just see the path so we can approximate
[11:41] this
[11:42] but let's suppose now we know this
[11:45] when we convert over the fourier series
[11:48] the fourier series is actually a
[11:50] particular solution
[11:52] of the
[11:53] second derivative of euclidean space
[11:57] so
[11:57] the way to think about that is we know
[11:59] the distance between two points is a
[12:01] straight line
[12:02] how do you define a straight line um
[12:07] you do it by saying that the second
[12:08] derivative is equal to zero everywhere
[12:11] so if i solve that the second derivative
[12:13] equals zero everywhere
[12:15] um
[12:16] then i solve that function um or sorry i
[12:19] do the second derivative of a function
[12:21] in euclidean space so the square the d
[12:23] squared f
[12:25] equals negative f kind of thing
[12:26] i get uh sine and cosine is the
[12:28] solutions
[12:30] so these sines and cosines actually form
[12:32] an orthonormal basis that
[12:35] will be able to represent the entire
[12:37] space in euclidean space
[12:38] and what i care about is is these b of
[12:41] k's afk is an a naught
[12:43] so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
[12:44] take this function and rewrite it in its
[12:47] basis
[12:48] and i need to figure out what those
[12:50] coefficients are um
[12:52] so
[12:53] the way that works is i get this nice
[12:56] little result it's the fourier integral
[12:58] transform
[12:59] all i have to do is take each
[13:02] fundamental frequency or its basis
[13:04] element
[13:05] for some frequency k
[13:07] multiply it by the signal and then
[13:08] compute this integral
[13:10] all right and this is pretty
[13:12] straightforward this is this is calc 1
[13:13] at this point so
[13:15] let's let's actually do that
[13:17] um so we're going to do a naught
[13:19] remember my s of x so it's s of x times
[13:22] uh
[13:23] cosine zero of x so it's just the
[13:26] integral of s s of x dx um
[13:29] i go and uh put in s of x and i can
[13:32] compute this integral and equals zero so
[13:34] a naught is zero and you can go ahead
[13:36] and verify this at home
[13:38] now if i go and do i'm going to pick a3
[13:41] and i pick a3 for a reason uh so s of x
[13:45] times cosine um uh
[13:50] i think i goofed here oh yeah i goofed
[13:52] up this should be a three so apologies
[13:54] so this is cosine of three x um
[13:57] when i do this integral for cosine of
[14:00] three x is that right oh no i did this
[14:02] right this is a1 oh geez i'm sorry guys
[14:04] that is my fault i copied three to three
[14:06] so this is a1 um
[14:09] this should be a1 yeah sorry uh
[14:12] so i do the integral of s of x cosine of
[14:14] x when i do this integral you can verify
[14:16] that this is going to equal 3.
[14:19] so
[14:19] i know that so this is actually the
[14:22] first fourier coefficient
[14:24] so if i get this 3 i get 3 cosine x and
[14:29] that is actually the first part of f of
[14:31] x
[14:32] so if i go and plot that that's my
[14:34] approximate
[14:36] run of the route
[14:38] and uh that's
[14:41] not good it's really not good i have i
[14:44] have a
[14:44] i get the general mean path but i have
[14:47] nothing with the serpentine process
[14:50] but if i go and do the other levels of
[14:52] these coefficients
[14:54] right i know because i set this function
[14:56] up the way it is i know that the first
[14:58] for corey fourier coefficient is going
[15:00] to be 3
[15:01] i know that the seventh fourier
[15:03] coefficient under sine is going to be 10
[15:05] and i know the 11th fourier coefficient
[15:08] of um
[15:10] of the 11th fundamental frequency is
[15:12] gonna be negative three and you can go
[15:14] and verify that at home and what happens
[15:16] is this green dashed line is going to be
[15:18] the first fourier coefficient
[15:21] uh component plus
[15:23] the third fourier coefficient or seventh
[15:26] sorry seventh one and then with red it's
[15:28] going to be the 11th and you see that
[15:30] the red just masks the entire blue
[15:33] so
[15:34] we'll end up with a perfect fit here
[15:35] that's fantastic um
[15:38] the uh perfect fit should happen we pick
[15:40] the function that matches the
[15:42] fundamental frequencies perfectly
[15:46] um
[15:47] so from there what we're gonna do is
[15:48] we're gonna apply this to a um
[15:51] to an actual path
[15:53] um
[15:54] so we're going to cheat a little bit
[15:55] here and i'll explain what we're going
[15:56] to do um and we're going to do sports so
[15:59] the zeppelmark's quote is you can't have
[16:01] a good football team unless you have
[16:02] good football players
[16:03] uh zeppelmarks was a gm uh obviously
[16:07] um
[16:08] but here what we're after is uh we're
[16:10] going to have this particular track
[16:13] and how i'm going to cheat is is i'm
[16:15] going to make sure that the track
[16:16] doesn't self-intersect means that
[16:19] you're not going to come backwards it is
[16:21] an actual function
[16:22] um and the reason i'm doing that is
[16:24] because we want to be able to
[16:26] represent this uh
[16:28] the this path in the fourier space when
[16:31] they come back and self-intersect uh it
[16:33] doesn't it doesn't work anymore and in
[16:35] fact we have to do something completely
[16:37] different uh
[16:39] we have to move to like two-dimensional
[16:40] or temporal
[16:41] domain versions
[16:43] um
[16:44] so with this path we can now represent
[16:47] the downfield location as the x-axis and
[16:51] then across field is going to be their
[16:53] y-axis and we want to be able to
[16:56] characterize this route right because
[16:57] we're going to think of that iris
[16:58] problem we want to build like a barcode
[17:00] for it and then we can use that barcode
[17:02] to do whatever statistics we want to do
[17:04] so
[17:06] what i'll do is i'll compute the first
[17:09] integral and that first integral is
[17:10] going to be the integral of my
[17:13] particular function
[17:15] times 1 right because cosine fundamental
[17:17] frequency zero cosine zero is one so i'm
[17:20] going to do the integral of this path
[17:22] now i don't know this path
[17:25] right
[17:26] we all we know all we see is just a
[17:28] collection of x y components
[17:30] so when that happens
[17:33] this integral that i'm trying to compute
[17:35] this constant co this constant
[17:37] coefficient
[17:39] uh
[17:40] has to be done numerically so i have to
[17:42] use a numerical solver
[17:44] so i'll use trapezoid rule or simpson's
[17:46] rule um and when i do that i'll get a
[17:49] coefficient a naught so i plot a naught
[17:51] all right there we go that is the
[17:53] zero order fourier series approximation
[17:55] of the route and that is uh that is
[17:58] terrible so we're not anywhere close to
[18:00] the route it doesn't even give you the
[18:01] mean average of the route like it's just
[18:03] it's just a straight line that's that's
[18:05] off by like 10 to 20 feet
[18:08] but
[18:09] if i go to the first 10 levels and
[18:11] compute that numerical integration for
[18:13] each of those 21 first coefficients
[18:16] um and then i multiply them by the the
[18:19] basis function all of a sudden
[18:22] you see i'm now seeing that the path as
[18:25] the mean trajectory
[18:27] of the fourier representation
[18:30] and i can keep going
[18:31] and you'll see this just
[18:34] start to connect
[18:36] and this is pretty cool like we're like
[18:37] all right this is fantastic uh i have a
[18:39] representation
[18:41] and i have a signature that's associated
[18:44] with this and i'll show you quick what
[18:45] it looks like that's the signature of
[18:47] the path that's my iris bar code all i
[18:50] have to do is take this guy and then run
[18:51] effectively hamming distance against it
[18:53] and i can search all tracking data in
[18:56] this space and find all those routes
[18:58] almost immediately
[18:59] but
[19:00] there's a little subtle problem here
[19:03] the first problem is not all routes are
[19:05] the same so if i've got this player to
[19:07] run this route again
[19:09] then he might come out on this bend an
[19:12] extra two three feet and the question is
[19:14] is what happens there
[19:16] this is a global effect this is a global
[19:20] uh
[19:21] approximator so if i have a small change
[19:24] on the bend here i'm going to see
[19:26] changes out at the beginning of the
[19:28] route
[19:29] and that's
[19:31] it's understandable but it's not
[19:33] desirable
[19:35] so what will happen is in the
[19:36] coefficient space
[19:38] um i'll see these guys adjust a little
[19:40] bit but i'm also going to see these
[19:41] these big components the big fundamental
[19:44] frequencies um
[19:46] those will adjust too
[19:48] and that
[19:49] so we really want to find like more of
[19:50] like a local
[19:52] a localization
[19:55] and the reason this occurs
[19:58] this that ringing will occur out here is
[20:00] back again to
[20:02] these equations
[20:06] here
[20:07] this these cosine k of x to the sine k
[20:09] of x's if we have a small adjustment in
[20:11] that s of x that's going to throw this
[20:13] entire cosine of kx a little out of
[20:16] whack this a of k is going to change
[20:17] accordingly so we multiply a k by cosine
[20:21] k of x and that's what we're plotting
[20:23] when we put that on
[20:24] this slight adjustment is going to be
[20:26] affecting this cosine function which
[20:28] operates over the entire path
[20:31] so
[20:32] the fourier series is not the way you
[20:34] want to go for doing play registration
[20:36] but
[20:37] this is like the the the ground zero of
[20:40] getting on to what we actually do
[20:43] which is apply a localization based
[20:46] approach and the most common
[20:48] localization based way is to use
[20:50] wavelets
[20:51] um
[20:52] i've done the first three hearts marx
[20:54] brothers uh the fourth mark's brother is
[20:56] harpo and if you know anything about
[20:57] harpo he doesn't really speak um so hong
[21:00] kong
[21:01] here we go
[21:03] uh so the wavelet model is going to take
[21:04] effect of the fourier setup this is why
[21:07] we start with fourier and instead of
[21:10] writing the function f of x we're
[21:12] actually going to
[21:13] use a different type of basis and we
[21:15] call this a multi-resolution basis and
[21:17] what multi-resolution means is that um
[21:21] in the fourier series we have the big
[21:23] fundamental frequencies like the
[21:25] constant coefficient or the one period
[21:27] sine wave that covers the entire space
[21:30] um
[21:31] but we also get
[21:33] uh
[21:34] smaller squares so we've like the higher
[21:35] frequency components but instead of
[21:37] covering the entire space like cosine k
[21:39] of x does we're going to look at like
[21:41] little
[21:42] little little sticks little square
[21:44] regions and you'll i'll show that in
[21:45] just a moment but that gets represented
[21:48] by this type of chopping up of the space
[21:51] the sample space
[21:53] um so the way of thinking of
[21:55] multi-resolution is i have a big square
[21:57] that operates and i want to see what
[21:59] happens to the big square but then
[22:00] inside i have little squares and inside
[22:02] those little squares i have even smaller
[22:04] squares
[22:05] so i'm getting like varying sizes of of
[22:08] uh resolutions hence the
[22:10] multi-resolution
[22:12] and one such construction we'll use and
[22:15] this is like the most simple is the hard
[22:16] wavelet and i'm going to use the heart
[22:18] wavelet because it is discontinuous at
[22:20] certain spots and the pictures look
[22:22] really nice
[22:23] when we do see them
[22:25] and the hard wavelet has two components
[22:27] it's called a father wavelet and a
[22:28] mother wavelet oh man this
[22:30] sorry
[22:31] when my mouse moves it kicks the slides
[22:34] for some reason um
[22:37] this is the father wavelet here and this
[22:39] we're going to operate over the unit
[22:40] interval because it's simple to
[22:42] recognize
[22:43] um
[22:44] so we have the father wavelet here and
[22:46] then um
[22:48] that is just a constant function one and
[22:50] then the mother wavelet here
[22:53] is um it's it's a piecewise constant
[22:56] function where i have a negative
[22:58] one that operates over uh zero and
[23:01] one-half and then a uh positive one that
[23:04] operates over one-half to one so it's
[23:07] we'll show the picture in a sec but
[23:08] what's happening is that i'm i'm looking
[23:10] at a big square
[23:12] and splitting it into two smaller
[23:14] squares where one is a negative one and
[23:16] the other is a positive one
[23:19] and then um because of which where are
[23:22] we going here there we go
[23:23] because of this
[23:25] uh multi-resolution that i'm using here
[23:27] it's two to the j
[23:31] um
[23:32] then i can index this by j and k and i
[23:35] just keep taking each half interval and
[23:38] splitting those into positive and
[23:39] negative ones and what happens is this
[23:42] actually builds me an orthonormal basis
[23:45] uh just like the sines and cosines did
[23:47] but i now get this locality uh
[23:50] this ability to capture locality and i
[23:52] can rewrite my signal or my route or my
[23:55] function
[23:56] um in the exact same way that the
[23:58] fourier series is i
[24:00] have to just compute these these
[24:02] coefficients computing the coefficients
[24:05] is exactly the same as the fourier
[24:08] series i just do the convolution and
[24:10] take the integral um
[24:12] and uh
[24:13] you just have the only there's only one
[24:15] subtle thing here is you have to
[24:16] remember that there's good there's a
[24:17] coefficient that's going to normalize
[24:18] this this function so i'm assuming that
[24:20] these are actually normalized
[24:22] um but i can extract out those
[24:24] coefficients alpha here is called the
[24:26] state scaling coefficient that's like
[24:28] that constant function and then the
[24:30] betas are going to be the detail
[24:32] coefficients and that's what's going to
[24:33] adjust the uh the different heights of
[24:36] the basis functions
[24:38] all right
[24:40] so all we have to do is compute those
[24:41] again again we have to do numerical
[24:43] integration or out in the wild but here
[24:45] we're going to do it in um
[24:48] using real functions actually i'll
[24:49] actually do this with um
[24:51] the uh
[24:52] route so we'll see the numerical result
[24:54] all right so this is what a har wavelet
[24:57] looks like
[24:58] so this line here that is the father
[25:00] wavelet that's the constant function
[25:02] that goes through
[25:03] um the entire domain
[25:06] and then the first mother wavelet
[25:07] remember is negative one for the first
[25:09] half
[25:10] and positive one for the second half and
[25:12] if you notice they're not quite uh
[25:14] negative one
[25:15] and positive one they're actually
[25:16] adjusted to be
[25:18] the uh
[25:19] corresponding height um and it's a
[25:21] little trippy when you look at this this
[25:23] picture because the father wave that's
[25:25] actually at one half he's not at zero
[25:27] and that makes sense because he's got to
[25:28] have some weight to him um so don't
[25:31] don't get hung up on the distance
[25:33] between
[25:34] the father wavelet the mother wavelet
[25:36] um but this is that negative one over
[25:38] the first half that's that positive one
[25:39] over the second half and then the second
[25:41] set of mother wavelets are these blue
[25:43] ones and i'm splitting the first half of
[25:46] the interval into a negative one and
[25:47] positive one of course scaled fourth and
[25:50] orthonormality
[25:51] and then the other half i have yet
[25:53] another
[25:54] now here's where it gets a little tricky
[25:57] when i go and fit a function
[26:00] if i can go this way when i go and fit
[26:02] this function identify the coefficients
[26:04] it's over the psi of j k
[26:07] so what's not happening is i'm not
[26:09] fitting it for this guy
[26:11] i'm fitting it for this guy
[26:13] and this guy simultaneously
[26:16] all right so that is
[26:18] that's a little bit more of a challenge
[26:19] here to try and connect those dots but
[26:22] as we as they do fit for this one
[26:25] this left side the negative one here
[26:27] gets split again into a smaller
[26:30] resolution and that smaller resolution
[26:32] is going to pick up the detail that this
[26:35] blue wavelet is not going to capture and
[26:37] that's where we're getting our locality
[26:40] um so here's the fit of the wavelet
[26:43] structure so this is the father wavelet
[26:45] in the top left
[26:47] it actually looks like a mean constant
[26:48] route that's way better than the fourier
[26:50] series
[26:51] at least in my opinion it's still
[26:52] terrible but it's a good fit uh uh for
[26:55] the mean at least
[26:56] um then we go to the level zero wavelets
[26:58] we've included that uh
[27:02] this red one right here so that's with
[27:04] the red mother wavelet and we get this
[27:06] step function and we start to see as we
[27:08] include more and more mother wavelets we
[27:10] see everything start to converge on the
[27:12] path to the point that when we get to
[27:14] the level seven wavelet we've almost got
[27:16] this thing pretty much nailed and
[27:17] fortunately there's enough curvature
[27:18] here that we see the step function
[27:20] running up
[27:22] so we still do see it's actually a step
[27:24] function and me not just plotting the
[27:25] orange on top of the blue
[27:28] but we get ourselves a signature and
[27:30] that is the signature of the route and
[27:32] we can use this as our barcode and just
[27:34] run it over as if it's a
[27:36] uh run it over all routes
[27:39] um
[27:40] to to uh with this hamming distance to
[27:43] be able to extract out the different
[27:44] routes so
[27:46] um not only do we get like the spatial
[27:48] resolution uh or the spatial information
[27:50] the local spatial information but we
[27:52] also get this multi-resolution so the
[27:54] way that i've stacked this is based on
[27:56] what's called a coefficient number so
[27:58] the the father wavelet is actually zero
[28:00] the first level the zero level mother
[28:02] wavelets the first level of mother
[28:03] wavelets they're down here around you
[28:05] know like one to
[28:07] three or something like that
[28:08] and then uh the detail coefficient
[28:10] numbers the smaller the smaller segments
[28:14] of those little sticks those little
[28:15] rectangles are out here
[28:17] and as you see a bunch of these are
[28:18] effectively all zero and that kind of
[28:20] makes sense because there's there's
[28:22] parts of the path that are relatively
[28:23] flat and once it's flat and we've got it
[28:26] pretty much captured
[28:28] that those new portions of the wailets
[28:30] aren't going to introduce anything uh
[28:32] important
[28:33] um but if you ran serpentine you would
[28:36] see these guys kind of triggering and
[28:37] doing a little little dance um now
[28:40] here's the really cool thing about that
[28:42] um
[28:43] if
[28:44] i have
[28:45] uh that we run this route again and it
[28:48] comes out a little bit farther here
[28:50] we'll see a little bit of change in the
[28:53] father the father wavelet he might shift
[28:55] slightly down
[28:57] right it's not going to be huge but the
[28:59] more important thing is that these guys
[29:01] over here are almost are almost
[29:03] completely unaffected
[29:05] and the guy who gets affected are going
[29:07] to be the ones it'll be this way but
[29:09] here
[29:10] so this right hand wavelet um and then
[29:12] when we get to uh this level two wavelet
[29:15] picture here the guys who's affected are
[29:17] just these two
[29:19] um and these guys are pretty much all
[29:21] the same
[29:22] so
[29:23] uh if we do have a big change in this in
[29:25] the route or if there's different routes
[29:27] that are the same if there's different
[29:29] trajectories that represent the same
[29:30] route we're able to still capture those
[29:33] routes and it'll be within variation you
[29:36] have to build the statistical test to
[29:37] capture that
[29:38] and that statistical test is like those
[29:40] that iris bar code by modal distribution
[29:43] that i showed you before
[29:46] all right
[29:47] so um so i showed you how to do it with
[29:49] a particular route now we're going to
[29:51] expand this out to basketball and um
[29:53] there's actually a fifth mark's brother
[29:54] so if there's one thing you can take
[29:56] away if you know the marks brothers you
[29:57] always hear like the three or the four
[29:58] martha marx brothers who's actually a
[30:00] fifth
[30:01] so gumbo marks he says nothing he's a
[30:02] nun in the movies um
[30:05] but we're gonna expand this out to
[30:06] basketball and
[30:09] we started with this so what we've built
[30:11] is a non-parametric methodology for
[30:13] comparing two trajectories from tracking
[30:15] data this is just like the iris problem
[30:17] i have two irises i want to know if it's
[30:19] the same person so i build this
[30:21] methodology to extract out a unique
[30:24] barcode uh doing signal processing and
[30:27] then i run a statistical test over it
[30:29] here we're going to do the same thing
[30:30] for tracking data we're going to
[30:33] do a frequency decomposition we're going
[30:36] to to put it into a non-parametric
[30:37] domain we're going to
[30:39] then apply uh a um
[30:42] hamming code or some statistic
[30:44] statistical distribution to be able to
[30:46] say that these two track paths are the
[30:48] same
[30:49] and
[30:50] we showed the fourier series to get
[30:52] those coefficients that's like a
[30:54] traditional way to do it and it's a good
[30:56] segue to get you into wavelets
[30:58] but the wavelets are what's going to
[31:00] capture the spatial properties
[31:02] and we also get the multi-resolution so
[31:03] those deviations and the paths you know
[31:05] we actually capture some of that without
[31:08] doing global changes
[31:10] but
[31:10] remember i said i cheated we used a
[31:13] track path that didn't self-intersect
[31:15] and in reality these paths do intersect
[31:17] so what we have to do is we we have to
[31:20] move to
[31:21] um
[31:22] a two-dimensional domain
[31:24] and that gets a little bit more
[31:26] challenging here
[31:28] so what happens is that we're going to
[31:31] chop up the space and we're using the
[31:33] hard way let's still but we're going to
[31:35] chop the space into a series of
[31:37] rectangles
[31:38] and this is going to be um wavelet's a a
[31:41] level 4 no level 2 wavelets there's a
[31:44] level 2 wavelet here and it's just going
[31:46] to keep chopping up more and more and
[31:48] more
[31:49] so what will happen is if we run a
[31:50] particular play um let's just say
[31:53] there's a lift right so if we run a lift
[31:55] that
[31:56] comes up the side of the three-point
[31:58] line um from in the corner you're just
[32:01] gonna see these two boxes interacting
[32:03] um
[32:04] if you see it down here you're gonna see
[32:06] it across three different boxes if you
[32:07] see it here you're gonna see it uh on a
[32:09] hand like
[32:10] four or five boxes and it's gonna keep
[32:12] getting smaller and smaller but
[32:16] i don't want you to take away like oh
[32:18] we're just going to count how many
[32:20] how many things are in the box it's not
[32:22] it's not that simple what's happening is
[32:25] is we're coming back to here remember
[32:28] each box is related so each of the box
[32:30] is going to be each branch here
[32:32] so uh when we looked at the um
[32:36] the the the left hand upper left hand
[32:38] corner that dallas mavericks
[32:40] court um that's like
[32:43] one box is this branch remember this
[32:45] branch doesn't get estimated alone it
[32:47] gets estimated with the box next to it
[32:50] um that so that's going to be similar
[32:52] here
[32:53] so if i have a path that's going here
[32:56] i'm not only going to look at
[32:58] this is a this is a plus one and this is
[33:00] a minus one let's say but i'm also going
[33:02] to look at this is a plus one and this
[33:04] is a minus one and this is a minus one
[33:07] and this is a plus one and you're
[33:08] actually going to get like a three um a
[33:11] four choose three combination here uh
[33:14] four choose two
[33:16] combination and
[33:18] the the number of coefficients kind of
[33:19] explodes um
[33:21] that's fine we can still do that that
[33:23] computation will uh but we have to be
[33:26] very careful that this is not just a box
[33:28] counting thing
[33:29] um and that gabor filter that i showed
[33:31] you is basically what we're
[33:33] reconstructing even though it's going to
[33:34] be a two-dimensional heart wavelet but
[33:35] you saw how like it was a
[33:36] two-dimensional picture
[33:38] uh with the iris codes and how it kind
[33:40] of went up and down and left and right
[33:42] that's the same thing that's happening
[33:43] here
[33:45] so if i was to take the a bucks ram play
[33:47] um so this is a play they ran hundreds
[33:51] of times last season um
[33:54] so bucks ram is they run a player just
[33:56] inside the free throw line uh run comes
[33:58] down set screen
[34:00] uh at the at the charge circle player
[34:03] comes up set screen at top so that's
[34:04] kind of a ram screen
[34:06] bucks ram is they set it with
[34:09] two very particular players such that uh
[34:12] this
[34:12] screener comes down and that screener
[34:14] comes off the roll
[34:16] um
[34:17] so
[34:18] if we go and look in the the
[34:21] coarse
[34:22] wavelet grid
[34:23] uh we see that we're affecting one two
[34:26] three
[34:27] um we find trajectories that are
[34:28] affecting three boxes here and we're
[34:31] finding that effects two so if i see a
[34:33] bend if we run this play multiple times
[34:35] and this guy sets the screen a little
[34:36] bit higher
[34:37] um if he sends if he sets the screen
[34:39] higher we're going to see a different
[34:40] type of bend to his screen
[34:42] or his trajectory but he's still
[34:44] operating in these two boxes
[34:46] so you're just going to see the segment
[34:48] of points coming across you can do the
[34:49] numerical integration and you'll see
[34:51] that these coefficients aren't going to
[34:53] change dramatically
[34:55] however in the more finer
[34:57] uh
[34:57] case you're going to see those
[34:59] coefficients change quite a bit
[35:02] the good news is that even though these
[35:03] coefficients change quite a bit
[35:06] you you're going to get the deviations
[35:08] measured here but you're not going to
[35:10] say it's not the same path
[35:12] um because of these type of wavelets
[35:14] that will help out um and i make it
[35:17] looks like a big jump that's here but
[35:19] this is the difference between these two
[35:21] is
[35:22] several this is this is like a a level
[35:24] um this is a level two uh this is more
[35:27] like a level um i'm just gonna guess
[35:30] uh like six or five
[35:33] um
[35:34] so
[35:35] you know you're gonna have a lot of
[35:36] levels in between so don't think that
[35:38] it's just a jump between left and right
[35:41] but we can build the signatures for this
[35:43] uh and then we can go and look at all
[35:45] segments now uh segments and do the
[35:47] hamming distance and then whatever guys
[35:49] have a high probability of matching
[35:51] across the spectral coefficients then
[35:53] that is our that's our play
[35:56] so it's a way to basically uh do look up
[35:59] right necessary registration is
[36:01] so
[36:03] that's the two-dimensional case now the
[36:04] natural questions that come out of this
[36:06] is what is like a stopping and starting
[36:07] criterion how do i build plays so i've
[36:11] just talked about two trajectories here
[36:13] right so i have one player goes up so
[36:15] i'm gonna get one signature there i have
[36:16] one player comes down that's the
[36:18] signature uh what we miss here is the
[36:20] temporal information so this screen has
[36:22] to happen before this screen right
[36:23] because if they don't happen it looks
[36:25] kind of goofy
[36:26] so you're going to see this guy come and
[36:28] this guy go
[36:29] so the way that we do that is we build a
[36:32] waterfall plot
[36:34] and the way to do a waterfall plot is
[36:36] the
[36:37] one way to do it is
[36:39] we set the temporal domain going north
[36:42] and south
[36:43] and then east and west is going to be
[36:46] the spectral coefficients
[36:47] so
[36:49] as the time goes we're going to take
[36:51] each each row is going to be like a
[36:52] frame effectively
[36:54] and uh a frame being a
[36:56] sample segment of tracking data and then
[36:59] we're going to um
[37:01] and then uh we're going to put the
[37:03] coefficients for that for that
[37:04] particular frame
[37:06] so what you can do is you can go
[37:07] backwards you can lead backwards to
[37:10] some stopping and starting criterion for
[37:12] the player um the obvious one that
[37:15] pretty much everyone that i know that
[37:17] does this uses is they look at the
[37:19] velocity of a player so if the player
[37:21] starts to come at rest or hits some sort
[37:23] of acceleration criterion um
[37:26] that will be the signal to end
[37:29] uh to end a segment and then when that
[37:31] player starts to pick up steam maybe
[37:33] some high load component or they just
[37:36] say velocity gets bigger than x um
[37:39] then they start a new segment for
[37:40] tracking that particular player
[37:43] so you can build those segments you're
[37:44] going to have a running waterfall plot
[37:46] for the entire period of play
[37:48] and then you can just build a uh you
[37:51] just build a window that searches for um
[37:54] like a ram screen because you know
[37:55] roughly how long a ram screen is put a
[37:57] little padding in there um and then you
[37:59] can just run that uh hamming distance
[38:02] from left to right just like we do for
[38:03] irises and you'll see the play pop
[38:06] but the north south would be the uh
[38:09] temporal
[38:10] the
[38:10] left right would be the um
[38:14] the wavelet coefficients so to be the
[38:19] signal like this
[38:21] they're going left right and then you're
[38:22] actually going to have a third dimension
[38:24] that comes out and this is why i didn't
[38:25] want to like display what the
[38:26] coefficients would look like for this
[38:28] thing so it'll look really confusing
[38:29] when you plot them
[38:30] but coming out at you are the different
[38:32] players because you have five players
[38:33] running simultaneously so you're
[38:35] effectively building like a tensor
[38:37] um and then your hamming distance is
[38:39] taking over the tensor space
[38:41] the good news is uh
[38:45] it's actually pretty straightforward
[38:47] it's a sparse setup so you can write a
[38:49] pretty clever way to do that
[38:51] so that's how we would register plays um
[38:54] the important point from this talk again
[38:56] was just to show how to do the
[38:57] integration
[38:59] and you can swap out the numerics for it
[39:01] to show what an orthonormal basis looks
[39:02] like and how we convert a signal to an
[39:05] orthonormal basis
[39:06] um
[39:08] so
[39:08] uh we kind of have that in hand we know
[39:11] what we could do for the next steps
[39:14] the natural questions from that point is
[39:16] okay cool
[39:17] is this a powerful
[39:19] tool and the big takeaway from this tool
[39:22] is
[39:23] it is powerful
[39:25] meaning that it does get you results it
[39:28] is interpretable uh so if you do see two
[39:30] players on the same you can actually
[39:31] crack it open look at the coefficients
[39:33] and be like okay well these are the
[39:34] coefficients that are different that
[39:35] tells me that
[39:37] these uh these basis functions are a
[39:39] little a little off what are those basis
[39:41] functions okay it's the high curvature
[39:43] component that tells me to look at say
[39:45] the acceleration that might tell me
[39:47] intuition of how much does this player
[39:48] actually turn himself
[39:50] uh in a play
[39:51] and you can work with the performance
[39:52] team on understanding how well players
[39:54] can read by looking at the shifts of
[39:55] shoulders but we don't have shoulder
[39:57] data and basketball so it's one way to
[39:59] start inferring body position
[40:03] but
[40:04] it is a computationally exhaustive
[40:07] approach
[40:08] so it is slow it is it is very slow and
[40:11] in 2013 days when we started building
[40:12] this it was even slower than what we can
[40:14] do now with gpus and parallel processing
[40:17] um
[40:19] but uh we can use algorithms like what's
[40:21] called lifting so we can use lifting
[40:23] algorithms to uh more quickly identify
[40:26] the coefficients but we do sacrifice
[40:27] some of the interpretability in doing
[40:29] that
[40:29] um the other natural question asked is
[40:32] what's the benefit of doing something
[40:33] like this versus a neural network like a
[40:34] convolutional neural net
[40:36] the benefit is we get interpretability
[40:38] in convolutional neural networks you
[40:40] lose a lot of the interpretability um
[40:43] and you can get you can start
[40:44] misdiagnosing plays if your job is to
[40:46] just classify plays i would encourage
[40:48] you to use convolutional neural nets but
[40:50] if your job is to diagnose plays
[40:53] um
[40:54] where prediction is no longer king like
[40:56] you want to be able to predict but you
[40:58] need to be able to
[40:59] explain um then convolutional neural net
[41:02] works are not really the way to go um if
[41:06] you do a different style of neural nets
[41:07] some folks will just build boxes and
[41:09] then do heat map counting like look out
[41:11] how many uh uh times the player was in a
[41:13] box and running all night over that
[41:15] you sacrifice the orthonormal basis
[41:19] requirements uh you'll probably get a
[41:21] good prediction but again you're going
[41:23] to fail an interpretability
[41:25] um
[41:27] so um
[41:30] right so
[41:32] that's the other thing is like when
[41:34] curve matching approaches i know there's
[41:35] a few papers out there about curve
[41:36] matching
[41:37] um
[41:39] uh sorry i'm seeing all these chat
[41:41] pop-ups um
[41:43] for curve matching approaches um trying
[41:45] to align those coefficients uh takes a
[41:48] great deal of effort
[41:50] so with trajectories used you have to
[41:52] identify at the stop and start times
[41:54] in the start location and then the
[41:56] associated uh parameters of the curve
[41:59] so you get a great interpretability of
[42:01] those algorithms but they're very
[42:02] sensitive to changes in the distribution
[42:05] so multi-resolution becomes an issue for
[42:07] them
[42:08] so that's pretty much all i got here
[42:11] so i guess i should open the floor for
[42:13] questions
[42:14] so i appreciate everything that um
[42:17] uh i appreciate you guys having me here
[42:19] and allowing me to to ramble my way
[42:21] through the talk at
[42:23] six something in the morning
[42:31] yes thank you dr jacobs um
[42:34] any
[42:35] questions that we have please make sure
[42:37] you put them into the chat
[42:44] dr yann did you want to go through the
[42:46] questions or would you like me to do
[42:47] that
[42:49] you go rob thank you
[42:53] all right so
[42:55] we we do have a question for me from
[42:58] lyle danley which i will answer separate
[43:00] uh to this
[43:02] but there
[43:03] there are um
[43:09] there is a question here from mr zang it
[43:13] says thanks for interesting presentation
[43:14] i wonder if you could give some more
[43:16] details on the interpretation of the
[43:18] coefficient and the k parameter
[43:22] oh sure
[43:31] yeah apologies if this feels like a fire
[43:33] hose
[43:34] um
[43:36] i wanted to get as much information out
[43:38] there as possible to tell the story
[43:40] um typically when you learn fourier
[43:43] series in undergrad it's
[43:45] between two and four classes so
[43:47] a uh 10 minute
[43:49] fire hose is not quite enough all right
[43:52] so each k
[43:54] is effectively the frequency
[43:58] so
[43:58] if i have k equals zero k equals zero is
[44:01] just going to be a straight line
[44:04] if i have k equals one
[44:06] um i'm doing cosine so it's actually up
[44:08] here it's going to be just that usual
[44:10] cosine function but you're just going to
[44:12] see that just one period through
[44:15] and then if i have two you're going to
[44:17] see two periods so the k is
[44:20] effectively
[44:22] the number of periods that go through
[44:25] the space the domain so here my domain
[44:27] is like 0 to 10.
[44:30] because i have
[44:32] a
[44:33] sinusoidal function and i know it's a
[44:35] sinusoidal uh
[44:38] actual sinusoidal function by
[44:40] construction
[44:42] that tells me that i can integrate over
[44:43] negative pi to pi
[44:45] but in reality if i'm over like 0 to 10
[44:48] i should be putting 0 to 10 in here and
[44:50] i should be putting in whatever that
[44:51] period is here so it's really like um
[44:54] 2 divided by the period so i would have
[44:56] 2 over um 2 over 10 so i should have
[44:59] like a 1 5 here
[45:00] and that will actually pull out those
[45:02] coefficients
[45:03] all right that was the k part what was
[45:05] the the interpretability so
[45:08] if i get a
[45:10] a0 so like for instance here i know i
[45:12] have a one period cosine like the one
[45:15] period cosine builds this and i can
[45:17] realize it and again i apologize for
[45:19] this this is the first
[45:20] fourier coefficients this is a1
[45:23] um
[45:24] i actually see
[45:26] that cosine period come through
[45:30] and um
[45:32] so that's that k one
[45:34] now
[45:36] if i go for the sine seven
[45:38] sine seven i'm gonna have seven periods
[45:39] that are ringing through here
[45:41] and um ten is just the amplitude so when
[45:44] i look at the coefficients the
[45:45] interpretability is telling me how much
[45:47] weight
[45:48] how much weight do i have of that
[45:50] frequency
[45:52] so this tells me that i have like three
[45:53] units worth of
[45:55] a um
[45:56] a period one cosine function
[45:59] in the wavelet domain
[46:07] it's the best way to put it in the
[46:08] wavelet domain
[46:09] the alpha 0 is going to tell me how much
[46:11] weight exists for this so let's suppose
[46:13] that um
[46:16] we have a flat function that's coming
[46:17] through here so it's like zero all the
[46:19] way until
[46:21] uh it moves then i expect all these
[46:24] coefficients here to offset whatever the
[46:26] first father wavelet's going to do
[46:28] so if i see a zero function and then i
[46:31] see like a y equals x function out here
[46:33] um
[46:35] it's this father wave it's not going to
[46:37] be zero because there is a positive
[46:39] weight here the function goes up like
[46:40] this so it's going to find wherever that
[46:43] average is and put it let's just say
[46:44] it's right here then i know that the
[46:46] blue is going to pull this .5 back
[46:49] towards zero because i need to estimate
[46:51] that zero
[46:52] and then i know that these and these
[46:54] blue guys will do a really good job of
[46:56] it like they're they're going to um
[46:58] probably flip and and have uh whatever
[47:01] the approximate value of this to pull
[47:03] down and then the black these black
[47:06] portions if this pulls it all the way
[47:08] down to zero everything below it is
[47:10] going to be zero so i know immediately
[47:12] i've captured the locality of this
[47:14] region and i can go and look at those
[47:15] coefficients and i'll see them all as
[47:17] zero so if i see a bunch of zeros within
[47:19] a subset because it's called a
[47:21] multi-resolution basis if i see
[47:23] everything in the sub resolutions to be
[47:24] zero then i know that i have a locally
[47:27] flat uh position which means my player
[47:29] is running in a straight line at that
[47:31] point
[47:32] um
[47:33] and approximating straight lines is you
[47:35] know we can already do that but
[47:37] keeping that idea in mind now tells me i
[47:39] can start that these coefficients are a
[47:41] little different are actually capturing
[47:43] the curvature of the play
[47:44] which is effectively how much that
[47:46] player is bending how how quickly
[47:47] they're turning um
[47:50] it gets us into the subtleties of the
[47:52] actual player player reaction capability
[48:00] we have one more question here um
[48:02] from kevin it says
[48:04] do you think it is possible to create a
[48:07] one-number catch-all metric in
[48:09] basketball
[48:11] no
[48:13] no
[48:14] um
[48:15] i think i think they're always fun but
[48:17] um
[48:19] no
[48:20] it's it's the job in basketball is not
[48:23] to
[48:24] rank players with a single number
[48:25] ultimately you have to say how much a
[48:27] player is worth or valued um you know x
[48:30] amount of dollars over so many years
[48:32] kind of thing because that's ultimately
[48:33] how you
[48:34] uh put players on your team
[48:36] but um
[48:38] you need a lot more that goes into that
[48:40] effort and and uh catch all it's going
[48:42] to miss how well a guy boxes out how
[48:44] well a guy disrupts passing lanes
[48:47] if you optimize for one uh aspect of the
[48:50] game you're going to
[48:51] undersell other players
[48:53] so what number metrics are fun for uh
[48:56] bar discussions um but
[48:59] they're they don't really uh they're not
[49:02] they're not the most important thing
[49:06] dr jacobs in response to your first uh
[49:09] question
[49:11] there was a follow-up from the same
[49:12] individual it says thanks for your
[49:14] explanation
[49:15] and i also would like to ask how it
[49:17] could be used as guidelines for
[49:19] basketball players in real basketball
[49:22] court or coaches a kind of curious
[49:25] question
[49:27] so going back to your coefficient and k
[49:29] parameter interpretation explanation
[49:32] could i can i ask how to
[49:34] i don't know how to interpret that
[49:36] question so like guidelines like uh
[49:39] like to try and instruct coaching
[49:42] staff from players or what its
[49:44] guidelines mean
[49:47] mr zhang if you wouldn't
[49:49] mind
[49:50] adding
[49:54] maybe helping to
[49:56] detail out that that question
[50:01] so if
[50:02] if it's my interpretation as he starts
[50:04] to put it in if i interpret is like how
[50:06] do you relay these results to a coaching
[50:08] staff or players or someone who's
[50:10] interested um like say a front office is
[50:13] interested in quantifying
[50:14] um
[50:15] then
[50:16] you do not you know under no
[50:19] circumstance do you take any of this
[50:21] work and go and put it in front of a
[50:22] player or a coach or any anyone but
[50:24] pretty much yourself and the analytics
[50:26] person you're working with um what you
[50:29] do
[50:30] or what i what i've done in the past is
[50:33] um
[50:35] you work with another analyst or you
[50:36] work with your director and you have a
[50:38] discussion about all right this is what
[50:40] i'm seeing this is how i interpret it um
[50:45] how like how do we want to frame this to
[50:47] have that discussion and more times than
[50:49] not like when i started talking about
[50:50] like this is how a player curves
[50:52] the the next logical steps that we do is
[50:55] we go and since we now know exactly
[50:56] where those plays are and we can find
[50:58] those plays without having to search
[50:59] video
[51:00] um we can go to the video because we now
[51:02] know when they happen and extract out
[51:04] those plays and then we say okay so we
[51:07] see what the subtle differences are in
[51:08] our coefficients what do we see in the
[51:11] play that matches to that
[51:13] and we'll we'll somehow convince
[51:15] ourselves that that might be the right
[51:16] answer and we'll once we put together a
[51:19] good story of okay we see this bend
[51:21] radius that's coming out and
[51:23] you know we might convince ourselves
[51:25] that this is how the player is
[51:27] navigating a particular screen because i
[51:29] didn't put i didn't put i was showing
[51:31] you offensive player trajectories i'm
[51:32] not showing you defensive player
[51:33] trajectories
[51:35] uh if it's just offense only that
[51:37] curvature when we pull the video it's
[51:38] like oh
[51:40] these screeners are taking an extra step
[51:42] left and they're doing that to disrupt
[51:44] the action and in these cases the
[51:46] screeners not there the screener is
[51:48] behind the player doing a chase
[51:50] and we can go we can now say okay well
[51:52] what does that mean for that player to
[51:54] to be setting those screens what what is
[51:56] it that they're picking up on and then
[51:57] we'll go to the next layer of analytics
[51:59] which is um how does that how does that
[52:02] affect whether or not we make that pass
[52:03] if it's an off-ball action um does this
[52:06] lead to a shot
[52:07] so if we have the action with no
[52:09] screener it's out do they shoot do they
[52:10] not shoot
[52:11] and we can start building like a
[52:13] diagnosis of how does that action
[52:15] disrupt our plays
[52:17] but we wouldn't know that that screen
[52:20] would be the case until we saw that
[52:22] deviation say okay what's really going
[52:23] on here and pull the video
[52:25] um
[52:26] so
[52:27] we would then craft that story to uh we
[52:30] would craft that story to come back to
[52:31] the coaching staff saying hey
[52:33] we're noticing this type of action have
[52:35] you seen this nine times out of nine the
[52:37] coaching staff already knows that that
[52:39] action's occurring but we're already
[52:41] armed with all the supplementary
[52:42] material this is what happens when that
[52:44] action is occurring and we can now color
[52:46] in the details of uh our our probability
[52:49] of pass goes down 56 which then
[52:51] translates to we're like half as likely
[52:54] to make those passes and you know this
[52:56] this is what happens next
[52:58] and um those little dialogues allow
[53:01] those coaches to be like all right video
[53:02] team
[53:03] go back and check to see how this play
[53:05] this defensive player interacts with our
[53:06] team and then they'll come up with their
[53:08] scheme to to either change it if they
[53:10] think it's detrimental to their game
[53:12] plan if it's not detrimental they'll be
[53:13] like all right that's cool thanks for
[53:15] the knowledge keep up the good work and
[53:17] you know that's pretty much where this
[53:18] would enter itself but i would yeah if
[53:21] you sho if you're showing yourself if
[53:22] you're showing this model to a coach you
[53:24] are
[53:25] in such the wrong direction of having
[53:27] that conversation
[53:33] i i actually have a
[53:34] question for you as an athletic trainer
[53:36] uh and someone who's constantly trying
[53:38] to
[53:39] you know prevent injury and or
[53:43] you know
[53:44] maybe highlight areas of dysfunction
[53:47] that i can work on to through
[53:49] rehabilitation and or with the coaching
[53:51] or strength conditioning staff to
[53:53] improve a player's performance what can
[53:56] you speak to maybe an example that where
[53:58] your work has has maybe assisted in in
[54:01] that realm or the behavior of a player
[54:04] as they approach
[54:05] you know a specific move uh within
[54:08] basketball or on the court
[54:12] um
[54:14] not with this work necessarily
[54:17] this work was pretty much
[54:19] specific for
[54:20] um
[54:22] this was pretty much specific for trying
[54:23] to find plays
[54:24] without having to write
[54:26] 7000 filters for each different play
[54:28] type um and find them robustly um there
[54:32] are other ways that we've done this so
[54:35] um if i do look at a trajectory there's
[54:36] some areas where i've looked at
[54:37] trajectories it'll be the next level
[54:39] after doing this but it's to look at um
[54:41] like how do players navigate screens
[54:43] that's why i brought it up because i
[54:44] worked on that quite a bit
[54:46] but um there's a newer algorithm that
[54:48] came out from carnegie mellon i think i
[54:50] want to get i'll give them props whether
[54:52] or not they made it or not um
[54:54] but it's called part affinity fields
[54:57] and um it basically is modeling the
[55:00] joint connectedness of a player and you
[55:03] can actually see like their limbs move
[55:04] around
[55:06] and there's some work that i've done
[55:08] where i've tinkered with their algorithm
[55:10] to try and build uh distributional
[55:12] tendencies of players because you can
[55:13] actually see them like twist when
[55:15] they're going around screens and you can
[55:17] see like how much how much acceleration
[55:20] of their shoulders like twists when they
[55:22] get hit when they're coming around the
[55:23] screen um
[55:25] and it was it was curious because you
[55:26] know the the first guy i always look at
[55:28] is steph curry because he gets just i
[55:31] don't just watch him on a play even if
[55:32] he doesn't have the ball just watch him
[55:34] get rocked on some of these screens
[55:37] um like he'll come in his his uh
[55:40] sorry he's on defense usually but these
[55:42] guys will come in and hit him when he's
[55:44] on defense and you'll see him just spin
[55:46] hard whereas like you see another guy
[55:49] like um
[55:50] eric gordon he doesn't get hit that hard
[55:53] and the question is like could we
[55:54] identify the way like we use loads
[55:57] sometimes to measure how much an athlete
[56:00] is burning energy out on the court but
[56:02] like loads don't capture how much these
[56:04] guys get rocked and it's like can you
[56:07] know we found like
[56:08] uh we've tried building like energy
[56:10] methods to see um
[56:13] to see how much energy or energy models
[56:15] like work models to see how much energy
[56:17] is expended by a player and we've tried
[56:18] to say all right well we don't know the
[56:19] heart rate like we don't know their
[56:21] internals so we can't quite measure it
[56:23] but let's let's just say the amount of
[56:25] rotation is just some amount of work and
[56:27] we'll do the physical model and treat
[56:28] them like a simple system and then just
[56:30] add that work on and then we'll look at
[56:32] things like their field goal percentage
[56:35] um or their uh their plus minus in a
[56:38] play and when i say plus minus i mean
[56:39] points i mean their amount of speed
[56:42] versus the speed of the play so if guys
[56:44] are like zipping down the court and one
[56:46] guy is like a negative three percent or
[56:48] negative 30 percent for speed that means
[56:51] the play is moving fast and the guy's
[56:52] trotting behind the play he's probably
[56:55] tired he's probably given up on the play
[56:57] um
[56:58] and we want to try we've looked at to
[57:00] see if if uh
[57:02] those guys are getting hit if they're
[57:03] getting hit and we're seeing that
[57:04] decline in those numbers like their
[57:06] their negative differential speed their
[57:08] field goal percentage or their their
[57:10] field goal plus if we see those drop
[57:13] um
[57:14] then that might tell us that we need to
[57:15] get that guy out or more importantly how
[57:17] do we re-scheme our defense so he's not
[57:19] getting hit as hard
[57:22] but that's like the closest that i get
[57:23] to the performance side rehabilitation i
[57:27] don't i haven't quite worked with on
[57:29] that
[57:31] thank you
[57:32] there is one other question here
[57:34] from nick it says how much total impact
[57:37] do you think maximizing play calling has
[57:40] in nba basketball
[57:42] it depends on who your players are
[57:45] i mean if we if we go to 1989
[57:47] um what was the what was the play called
[57:50] give michael the ball and get out of the
[57:51] way
[57:52] um you know there's it depends on the
[57:56] personnel
[57:57] um
[57:58] there are some teams that are just
[58:00] phenomenal at scheming
[58:02] um but sometimes the talent of a player
[58:04] will will over dominate the scheme
[58:07] so it really depends from situation to
[58:10] situation uh if you're if you're more of
[58:13] like a middling team who doesn't have
[58:16] a breakout player that can just take
[58:18] over a game
[58:19] um and i don't wanna i'm hesitant to
[58:21] name team names because you know i don't
[58:23] want to
[58:24] put any teams on blast but um if you
[58:27] don't have that that team then schemes
[58:30] um
[58:31] at least at least just a simple scheme
[58:33] like a first action
[58:35] like i'll pull one on blast so for
[58:37] houston
[58:38] um
[58:39] one thing that that we always want to do
[58:42] with houston is we always want to run
[58:43] pistol every chance we can get we want
[58:45] to run pistol because that would disrupt
[58:47] disrupt the parameter the perimeter
[58:50] defending guards and if we could disrupt
[58:52] them then that allows us to get quick
[58:54] open looks early or creates driving
[58:56] lanes to attack
[58:58] and uh if that didn't happen the next
[59:00] logical thing after that was to reset
[59:02] and set up brimrod when we have clinton
[59:04] so
[59:06] we know that those actions were going to
[59:08] occur like out of 100 possessions you're
[59:11] going to see each of those like 70 times
[59:15] but that wasn't like the first scheme
[59:17] after that it's kind of like all right
[59:18] diagnose how the defense is we have our
[59:21] set methods to go and attack and at the
[59:23] end of the day
[59:24] james is going to do what james is going
[59:26] to do
[59:27] he's going to read the play
[59:29] chris and russ were going to do the
[59:31] things that they needed to do
[59:33] and they knew how to adapt they knew how
[59:35] to play within
[59:36] d'antoni's scheme
[59:38] but um
[59:40] you know ski schemes are pretty
[59:41] important but you know it really depends
[59:43] on the roster
[59:47] all right um doesn't look like we have
[59:50] any more questions at this time and i
[59:51] believe we are
[59:53] at our time for the end of this session
[59:55] so
[59:56] um dr jacobs thank you so much for your
[59:58] presentation
[60:00] and i will turn it back over to dr yan
