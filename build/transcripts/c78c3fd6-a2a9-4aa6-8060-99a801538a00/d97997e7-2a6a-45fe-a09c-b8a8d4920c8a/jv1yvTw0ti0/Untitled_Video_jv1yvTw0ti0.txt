[00:00] uh they've all been finalists at the the
[00:02] big data ball did did you win is any did
[00:06] you win so they're only finalists so
[00:08] it's not that big a deal uh so sorry we
[00:11] couldn't get we couldn't get the
[00:12] finalist they all turned us down so
[00:13] we're stuck with these guys uh that's
[00:16] that's too mean isn't it I'm sorry are
[00:17] you are you coming to attack me over
[00:19] here I didn't win either no thank well
[00:21] thanks for robing all right uh I'm also
[00:23] a finalist also not a champion all right
[00:26] uh so the first Speaker we have today is
[00:28] a finalist from two years ago and that
[00:30] that two years ago it was a a talk about
[00:33] uh it was about lineman play um and this
[00:36] is uh how do you say batchelder this is
[00:39] Nick batchelder he is from I'm gonna say
[00:42] duke because it says Duke on his thing
[00:43] and we should also give Nick a round of
[00:45] applause because you recently finished
[00:47] slightly ahead of me in the kaggle NCA
[00:50] March Madness pool top 81 money he
[00:53] finished 12th I finished 15th so once
[00:56] again we're still just kind of
[00:58] losers what an intro Nick all right yeah
[01:02] and we are we were definitely not first
[01:03] so we were also last so that's the
[01:06] world's greatest intro that anyone's
[01:07] ever given anyone uh so let's welcome
[01:10] Nick bachelder to talk about end of play
[01:12] spatial density estimation in American
[01:13] football where are you right now though
[01:15] atke no he still a Duke yeah for two
[01:17] more weeks I'm a Duke um 2ish minutes 23
[01:22] is minutes okay I'm gonna set my
[01:25] timer okay sounds good I I like to look
[01:27] at it I don't know why do I have to talk
[01:29] into this is that like is that
[01:32] mandatory
[01:36] okay okay okay sounds good I'm setting
[01:39] my time give me one second all right um
[01:43] like Greg said uh I'm a master student
[01:45] at Duke University in biostats for about
[01:48] two more weeks so I'm G to say that as
[01:49] many times as I can um but I was a
[01:52] finalist two years ago in the big
[01:53] datable and then this year I was an
[01:55] honorable mention um for mostly this
[01:58] work this is kind of a part of my
[01:59] project this year because it it turned
[02:01] out to be what I spent most of my time
[02:03] on um and that's um end ofpl spatial
[02:06] density estimation obviously in American
[02:08] football um I think all of these will
[02:10] have to do with American football unless
[02:11] I unless I'm missing something um and
[02:14] also a deep learning approach to
[02:16] estimating uh spatial player influence
[02:26] um all right how do I AR
[02:34] down they don't teach gr school I
[02:38] know hey which one did you press press
[02:41] down okay sounds good um we'll see if I
[02:44] get that next time okay so we'll get
[02:46] started um so what is end of play
[02:48] prediction and why is it so important um
[02:50] right off the bat NextGen and Amazon and
[02:52] the NFL use end of play prediction for
[02:54] all types of things right um the most
[02:57] obvious ones being expected rushing
[02:59] yards rushing yards OV expected first
[03:01] down probabilities touchdown
[03:02] probabilities all things that U most
[03:04] people have heard of before essentially
[03:06] how how many yards are you preventing as
[03:09] a a Defender how many yards are you
[03:11] gaining as a rusher these types of
[03:12] things so um this is obviously an
[03:15] important part of a lot of the metrics
[03:16] that are created for nextg and that sort
[03:18] of thing right um and there's kind of
[03:21] four levels of complexity that I like to
[03:23] think of um when it comes to end of play
[03:25] estimation and I'm gonna kind of go
[03:27] through those so we can kind of get to
[03:28] where I did most of my work um so level
[03:31] one is just making a point estimate for
[03:33] end of playay yardage um so all this
[03:35] really is is you're taking a set of
[03:37] features those being movement features
[03:39] um of the defense the offense the ball
[03:42] carrier these might be velocities they
[03:44] might be images they might be spatial
[03:46] there's tons of things that these
[03:47] features could be but really all you're
[03:49] doing is you're feeding them into some
[03:50] sort of model with some assumptions
[03:52] these being maybe an XG boost model or a
[03:54] regression model or a neurl net
[03:55] depending on your linearity assumptions
[03:57] and your variance assumptions but at the
[04:00] end of the day all you're really getting
[04:01] is a sample mean in some sort of
[04:03] situation so you're saying I expect at
[04:06] the end of this play um we're going to
[04:08] end up at the 33 yard line and basically
[04:10] where is the tackle where is the
[04:12] touchdown where is the out of bounds
[04:13] going to happen right um and you're
[04:16] getting a point estimate and what I need
[04:18] to emphasize here is this is a mean
[04:20] right um and we that'll be important as
[04:22] we go on and I'll also say that I would
[04:23] say that this is about 90% of end of
[04:25] play models that I see right because um
[04:28] this is all you really need to create
[04:29] most most of those metrics that I talked
[04:30] about before um but I'm going to say
[04:33] that I don't think that this should be
[04:34] 90% of use cases I'm going to say that
[04:37] level two should be 90% of use cases and
[04:39] this is just adding one more component
[04:40] you're still getting a sample mean Point
[04:42] estimate with the same type of models um
[04:45] but now you're doing some sort of
[04:46] confidence estimation for your sampling
[04:48] error right so you're doing some sort of
[04:50] bootstrapping or standard error
[04:51] estimation if your model's linear um
[04:54] you're making some assumptions and
[04:55] you're saying now I can say my sample
[04:57] mean in this situation with this set of
[04:59] features
[05:00] um is it's going to be the play's going
[05:02] to end at the 33 yard line with some
[05:04] confidence right and this 95% confidence
[05:07] interval if I say uh the sample means
[05:09] between 31 and 34 yards I'm not saying
[05:12] that the play is going to end with 95%
[05:14] confidence between 31 yards and 34 yard
[05:17] the yard lines right I'm saying that the
[05:19] mean is somewhere in there and that's
[05:21] also something that I want to emphasize
[05:22] as I go on because that's going to be
[05:24] important um and that brings me to level
[05:27] three and now we're at multivariant
[05:29] Point for end play location so now we're
[05:31] doing the same thing we're still
[05:32] estimating confidence we're still
[05:34] estimating error but now we have some
[05:36] sort of multivariate model um and what
[05:38] that means multivariate not
[05:40] multivariable is we're taking well it's
[05:42] probably multivariable too but we're we
[05:44] have two dependent variables we have the
[05:46] downfield yard lines and we also have um
[05:49] the lateral yard lines meaning X and Y
[05:51] right um and most you use cases you
[05:54] don't need to do this right because
[05:56] usually for most of those metrics that
[05:57] we talked about um you're you're mostly
[06:00] caring about downfield yardage right but
[06:02] we're going to kind of find a use case
[06:03] where this is going to be cool and and
[06:04] pretty important um so now you have
[06:06] confidence estimates for X confidence
[06:09] estimates for y but we're still working
[06:10] with sample means right so this is the
[06:12] sample mean of where the play is going
[06:14] to end end up on the play and that
[06:16] brings us to level four which is what
[06:17] I'm going to talk about and that's um
[06:20] multivariate still it's still endep
[06:22] playay location but now we're talking
[06:23] about outcome distributions we're not
[06:25] talking about sample means we're not
[06:27] predicting a mean well we we are
[06:29] predicting mean but we're predicting a
[06:30] mean and we're pred predicting more
[06:32] right we're predicting the actual
[06:34] downfield outcomes um so this is now a
[06:37] distribution you can think think in the
[06:39] basian setting like a like a posterior
[06:42] predictive distribution right um and
[06:44] you're saying you can now make
[06:45] statements like I'm 95% confident that
[06:48] the play is going to end between X and Y
[06:50] yard line right we still get expected
[06:53] end of plays but now we can make
[06:54] statements about exactly the probability
[06:57] that if I take an area on the field
[06:58] what's the probability the play ends
[07:00] between this area right um and we're
[07:02] still going to do confidence estimation
[07:04] because I already emphasized that I
[07:05] think it's really important um in all of
[07:07] sports analytics but in this case
[07:09] especially when we're working with um
[07:11] limited data um but how are we going to
[07:14] model this and that's what I'm going to
[07:15] talk a little bit more
[07:16] about um so I want to mention some past
[07:19] work so in the in the 2020 Big Data Bowl
[07:21] the it was actually um a metric based
[07:24] Big Data bow where they had a
[07:25] leaderboard and that sort of thing um
[07:28] based on your um it was some sort of
[07:31] loss metric it was continuous rank
[07:32] probability score and they had people
[07:34] predict essentially end of play for
[07:37] rushers on Rush Plays and credit to
[07:40] nextg Stats Philip singer and Demitri
[07:42] Gord they came up with this
[07:43] convolutional architecture where they
[07:45] took some input features and they made
[07:48] um a cool set of movement features and
[07:51] they fed them through a series of
[07:52] convolutional networks and what they
[07:54] essentially got out was a distribution
[07:55] like I'm talking about um it was
[07:57] discreet meaning it was kind of a multi
[07:59] variant distribution um where you have
[08:02] basically a probability that um you the
[08:06] end of play is at the negative 20 yard
[08:08] line so on and so forth all the way up
[08:10] to 50 right so it's very high
[08:12] dimensional but they ended up winning
[08:13] the competition and there's some pros
[08:15] and cons to what they did right um the
[08:17] pros some of the pros being um it's a
[08:19] distributional estimate so we're to that
[08:21] level four level um there are no
[08:23] distributional assumptions in terms of
[08:26] what type of distribution is this it's a
[08:27] neural net that's essentially just out
[08:29] logits in a nonlinear way um and
[08:32] generally it has a great accuracy in
[08:33] terms of the the score that they used in
[08:35] the competition um but I'm going to
[08:37] point out a couple cons um not that this
[08:39] is a bad model at all it's probably
[08:40] better than I could do in terms of
[08:41] predictive accuracy right um but um it's
[08:44] downfield only um it doesn't have
[08:47] confidence estimation and the last one
[08:49] I'm going to talk a little bit more
[08:50] about um and that's the fact that it may
[08:52] struggle with multimodality and what do
[08:54] I mean by that so the way that I see the
[08:57] football tackle is by definition
[09:00] multimodal and what that means is every
[09:04] especially on Breakaway plays each
[09:07] tackle attempt is successful or if it's
[09:09] not right and if it's successful then
[09:11] the tackle is going to occur for the
[09:12] mean of that tackle with some variance
[09:15] dependent on yards after contact right
[09:17] and if it's failed then another tackle
[09:19] is going to be successful down the field
[09:20] or score score a touchdown right and
[09:23] it's going to have some other mean and
[09:25] some other variance dependent on a
[09:26] different yards after contact so that's
[09:28] kind of shown this in this image right
[09:30] here you see the ball carrier has a
[09:32] chance to be tackled in that first
[09:33] distribution let's say it's 60% chance
[09:35] with some variance around that mean but
[09:37] if he breaks that tackle and continues
[09:39] down the field then it's going to be
[09:41] some other distribution and so on and so
[09:43] forth right um and it's not really just
[09:45] going to be a continuous decline like we
[09:48] see here right this looks pretty normal
[09:51] there's a peak and then it's a
[09:52] continuous decline but that's not really
[09:54] the way intuitively the tackle process
[09:56] works right um even though
[09:59] obviously it's it's a fantastic model
[10:01] for accuracy um so let's summarize the
[10:04] general goal here we want to estimate a
[10:06] multimodal distribution of end of playay
[10:08] outcomes based on current player
[10:09] movement and position and there's a
[10:11] couple hurdles we have to jump over in
[10:14] terms of our data science process for us
[10:15] to do that we obviously have to estimate
[10:17] distributions as multimodal we have to
[10:19] generate input features that capture
[10:21] signal and spatial signal um and
[10:24] modeling must take in features um we
[10:26] have to have a model that take in the
[10:27] features that we design obviously
[10:29] and we still need to account for that
[10:31] sampling error that I emphasized earlier
[10:33] so how are we going to do that um
[10:34] conceptual Solutions and modeling um so
[10:37] that brings us to our first solution
[10:39] which is um a solution for the
[10:41] multimodal data and that's the mixture
[10:42] distribution and if you haven't seen
[10:44] this before uh the formula can look
[10:46] scary but it's really not so I've kind
[10:48] of broken it down here so the function
[10:50] on the right side is just the density of
[10:51] end of play right and all we're saying
[10:55] is that our density is going to be a
[10:56] mixture of K normal distributions and
[10:59] will we cross validate K right um with
[11:02] each distribution having some weight um
[11:05] PI right or P it should be PK um meaning
[11:10] what's the probability that this
[11:11] particular tackle attempt is successful
[11:13] and we're going to assume our distribu
[11:15] each of our distributions is normal for
[11:16] Simplicity and then for each normal
[11:18] distribution we're we're we're going to
[11:21] um basically estimate a point estimate
[11:23] for the mean in The X Direction the y
[11:25] direction and then perspective variances
[11:28] for the X Direction and Y Direction two
[11:30] um so we're going to get a coari matrix
[11:31] we're going to assume the co-variances
[11:33] are zero also for Simplicity because we
[11:35] have limited data and it's going to turn
[11:36] out to look something like that right
[11:38] that we're basically just estimating
[11:40] these means these variances and the
[11:42] probabilities of these distributions
[11:43] which are also shown
[11:45] there um so in order to do that we need
[11:48] to just uh generate some sort of spatial
[11:50] input right just like um the winners of
[11:52] the 2020 Big Data B did so I made these
[11:55] things I like to call movement Maps so
[11:57] they basically just represent their
[11:58] matrices of offensive position defensive
[12:01] position um just different velocities
[12:03] different accelerations and it basically
[12:06] turns into what I like to call an eight
[12:08] channel image so there's eight channels
[12:10] here representing these these different
[12:11] things and we can feed this into some
[12:13] sort of model or we want to feed this
[12:15] into some sort of model to capture the
[12:16] variance that I'm talking about and
[12:18] predict these parameters of that mixture
[12:20] distribution we talked about so how are
[12:21] we going to do
[12:23] that okay gets a little complicated here
[12:25] but I'm going to break it down um so in
[12:27] order to do that there's something
[12:28] called deep convolutional mixture
[12:30] density networks and their ways of
[12:32] estimating mixture distributions um in a
[12:34] nonlinear way from some input in this
[12:38] case image input right so we're going to
[12:40] take our movement feature maps and we're
[12:41] going to run it through an autoencoder
[12:43] and if you've never heard that word
[12:44] before the way I like to think about it
[12:47] is we're basically taking a bunch of
[12:48] information and we're reducing the
[12:50] dimensionality to keep um to keep
[12:53] basically signal there uh you can kind
[12:56] of think of it as a very nonlinear
[12:59] um like principal component analysis
[13:01] right um so that's the the purple
[13:03] segment there and we basically get this
[13:05] Vector that's an auto encoded version of
[13:07] our
[13:09] movement and we take that vector and we
[13:11] run it through three different neural
[13:12] Nets and that sounds crazy but it's not
[13:14] as crazy as it sounds um to get three
[13:16] different things and these are just the
[13:18] parameters that we already talked about
[13:20] and we can talk about them in a way
[13:21] that's not super mathy and really simple
[13:23] right so we're estimating our our means
[13:25] our M uh which just means where the
[13:28] distributional center for each possible
[13:30] tackle attempt and we're going to do
[13:31] that for each of the K distributions um
[13:34] and then we're going to do the same
[13:35] thing for coari matrices what's the
[13:37] standard deviation for each possible
[13:39] tackle attempt I.E yards after contact
[13:42] and then finally what's the probability
[13:44] of each tackle attempt being successful
[13:45] that's just the mixture um in our
[13:48] basically the p in our um in our mixture
[13:51] distribution and this perfectly fits
[13:53] into all the parameters of that mixture
[13:54] distribution right um and what we get in
[13:58] return oh well one more step sorry um
[14:00] there's one more hurdle right which is
[14:01] we still need to um estimate uncertainty
[14:05] and the way we do that is the same way
[14:07] we would for any other um Point estimate
[14:10] like our level one or level two model
[14:12] right we're just going to we're just
[14:13] going to um Ensemble model or use
[14:15] bootstrapping and we're going to fit
[14:17] maybe 10 of these models right and we're
[14:20] GNA um basically samp resample our data
[14:22] for each of the models um so we have
[14:25] let's say 12,000 plays with 30 uh frames
[14:27] per play we just sample one frame per
[14:29] play and feed all of those models into
[14:33] um basically different reinitialized
[14:35] versions of What I Call tackle net which
[14:37] is that that model on the last slide and
[14:40] what we get in return is 10 different
[14:42] estimates right of end of play
[14:44] distribution so that's what that um kind
[14:46] of the red heat map is there um just
[14:49] bootstrapped versions of a density
[14:50] estimation and what we get into return
[14:52] is on the right which is basically a
[14:56] distribution with confidence which is
[14:58] the shadow
[14:59] o over the course of the entire field in
[15:01] the X and Y direction of basically the
[15:03] density of where the end of play is
[15:05] going to occur and we can kind of
[15:07] visualize this for an example here so
[15:09] here's saquan making a breakaway tackle
[15:12] right this is a great example of why
[15:15] multimodality is really important here
[15:17] when he breaks that first tackle there's
[15:19] no chance he's going to get tackled for
[15:21] that entire mid segment Until the End
[15:23] right and you can see um you can see
[15:25] that in the plot here there's a chance
[15:26] at the very beginning he gets tackled
[15:28] right there but if he doesn't it already
[15:29] knows that he's almost going for a
[15:31] touchdown at the very least right and
[15:33] that's something that you you're not
[15:34] going to capture without that mixture
[15:36] distribution um that's not always the
[15:38] case so I have another example here um
[15:41] here's a case where it's not super
[15:43] multimodal right and that's why those
[15:45] mixture distri the mixture parameter so
[15:47] important sometimes your mixture
[15:49] parameter for one of your distributions
[15:51] is almost one meaning that you don't
[15:53] have a mixture and that's still a
[15:55] possibility here right like we're not
[15:56] saying that it has to be multimodal
[15:58] we're saying that we're giving our model
[16:00] a chance to estimate multimodality right
[16:03] um so this is another example where
[16:05] maybe multimodality isn't necessary and
[16:07] those other models might perform just as
[16:10] well um so what's the applications why
[16:13] are we estimating lateral field why do
[16:15] we need to do this is there any real use
[16:17] case for this right um and there is and
[16:20] the point is to make metrics and I feel
[16:22] like that's why we build models for most
[16:23] things so um I made a metric it's called
[16:25] percent field influence and the way I
[16:27] did it is I took a spatial basically you
[16:29] take a density estimation with a player
[16:32] um so that the one on the left is
[16:33] basically a basic density and then I did
[16:37] the same thing but I removed the
[16:38] defensive player and then I subtract the
[16:41] matrices of probabilities um to get what
[16:43] I like to call a contribution map and
[16:46] all that is is where is a particular
[16:48] player by removal affecting um where the
[16:51] end of play is going to occur so the red
[16:54] section is where that player is
[16:55] increasing the probability of end of
[16:57] play and the blue section is where he's
[16:59] decreasing the end of play so in this
[17:01] case the play is going toward the
[17:03] direction of like away from you so he's
[17:06] basically preventing yardage you can see
[17:07] the blue section is in the end zone
[17:10] basically so he's he's probably going to
[17:12] have a high expected yardage saved um so
[17:15] and then percent field influence is just
[17:18] the percentage of field area that um a
[17:20] defender's inclusion in density
[17:21] estimation influences so that doesn't
[17:23] mean it's positive influence it could be
[17:25] negative influence as well um and the
[17:27] point is that it's supposed to capture
[17:28] something different than expected yard
[17:30] saved expected yard saved is where is is
[17:33] is your influence good or bad this is is
[17:35] your influence strong right um and to
[17:38] make that point um and kind of
[17:41] annotation
[17:42] request um I'm going to decline The
[17:44] annotation request um but what's the
[17:48] relevance to this to tackling we said
[17:50] the Big Data B was tackling um the point
[17:53] is that expected yard saved and uh
[17:55] percent field influence capture
[17:57] different variability right so if you
[17:59] put both of these metrics in a model
[18:02] that predict whether a player is going
[18:04] to be involved in a tackle they're both
[18:06] independently significant and we can say
[18:08] the odds of tackle involvement increase
[18:09] by
[18:10] 243 for each expected yard prevented
[18:13] which is a metric we've had for a long
[18:14] time right but in addition to that the
[18:16] odds of tackle involvement increase by
[18:18] 6% for each percentage of field
[18:20] influenced and 1% of the field is about
[18:22] 60 square yards so you can basically say
[18:25] that for every 60 square yards um if you
[18:28] assume linearity then your odds are
[18:30] going to increase linearity of the log
[18:32] Gods um your odds are going to increase
[18:34] by 6% of achieve or being involved in a
[18:37] tackle right so independent variability
[18:39] for expected yard saved and um percent
[18:42] field influence um and I have just two
[18:44] more examples where you can kind of
[18:46] visualize this if the key will
[18:51] work
[18:53] maybe cool okay so here's just two
[18:55] examples um so on the left is just the
[18:58] basic distributional prediction of the
[19:00] end of play this play is going toward
[19:01] the end zone ball carriers in red you
[19:04] can see the mixture density that's
[19:06] estimated for this particular frame and
[19:08] then I put two Defenders here that are
[19:10] closest to the ball and along with their
[19:13] expected yard saved and their percent
[19:15] field influence you see that the
[19:16] defender on the left Edmonds they're
[19:18] both preventing um preventing the
[19:21] chances of a touchdown so they have both
[19:22] have positive expected yards saved by
[19:24] removal um but you can see Edmonds is
[19:27] massively decreasing the probability of
[19:29] a touchdown and you can see that
[19:30] visually in terms of the X and the y
[19:32] direction from that blue area that he's
[19:34] massively decreasing In The End Zone um
[19:36] Jones is is not doing quite as much um
[19:39] but you can kind of see how both
[19:41] expected yard saved and percent field
[19:44] influence are Vis visibly kind of
[19:47] different and also capture different
[19:49] types of variability right um I have
[19:52] this one more example it's it's pretty
[19:54] similar to the last one um I just kind
[19:56] of included it to have more more content
[19:58] and to like kind of show off what what
[20:01] is kind of the point of every bit of
[20:03] math that I just talked about um but I'm
[20:06] going to leave this up while I take
[20:07] questions so that um everybody can look
[20:09] at it um but thank you guys so much for
[20:12] listening um I'm Nick and I forgot to
[20:15] put contact information on here so if
[20:17] you want my contact information then
[20:19] just ask so yeah thank you guys does
[20:22] this work I'll walk around with the
[20:24] microphone for questions I'm not giving
[20:27] you the mic does anyone else have a
[20:29] question does anyone have a
[20:32] question okay um I have a question about
[20:35] the uh the bootstrap so you just
[20:40] randomly sample like a frame at the
[20:44] frame level basically right like do you
[20:47] have any concerns about that like with
[20:50] something like sampling at the play
[20:51] level or even the drive level be more
[20:55] reasonable cuz feel like with just
[20:57] sampling frames sampling well the reason
[21:00] why I sampled frames is because in my
[21:03] mind each frame in a play is um
[21:07] dependent right so for my neural net I
[21:09] want independent observations um and if
[21:12] I'm sampling multiple frames from the
[21:14] same play then I'm going to have a lot
[21:16] of dependence in my observations which
[21:18] is somewhat of a assumption killer um
[21:22] but yes you probably could U make
[21:24] bootstrapping potentially better by
[21:26] having more plays and having the
[21:27] autonomy to um be able to do that um
[21:30] again I also want to emphasize going
[21:32] along with that question that
[21:33] uncertainty for a lot of these
[21:35] predictions is massive and the reason
[21:37] why is this is a big model right and I'm
[21:38] using big data B data which is again
[21:40] 12,000 plays um in this particular case
[21:44] um so this is a big model and the idea
[21:47] is that you could run this with a lot
[21:48] more data and it would be your your
[21:51] estimation would be a lot more precise
[21:53] your um confidence intervals would be a
[21:56] lot smaller um but that's kind of the
[21:58] point of why we estimate confidence
[22:00] right I could just throw this up on the
[22:01] board and be like here's my density um
[22:04] but really in a lot of cases and you can
[22:05] see it right here the density is super
[22:07] variable and because we're working with
[22:09] a limited sample size even though 12,000
[22:11] sounds massive it's really not not that
[22:13] big right does anyone else have any
[22:15] other
[22:17] questions I'm gonna ask I'm gonna ask
[22:18] one
[22:20] then no questions
[22:23] I um you showed the multivariant normal
[22:26] distribution with zero on the coari MH
[22:29] did you um is that an assumption you
[22:32] made or it's definitely an assumption so
[22:34] you never you never checked to see I'm I
[22:36] I wonder I was wondering if you could
[22:38] talk about like what would the
[22:41] Practical implications be of including a
[22:44] covariant structure here and do you
[22:46] think yeah so I tried what it would look
[22:48] like or did did you try it at all and
[22:50] just too much computation I tried it so
[22:52] I decided at the end it wasn't it wasn't
[22:54] necessarily worth it um because it's a
[22:56] lot more parameters you're thinking
[22:58] let's say I select if I allow K to be up
[23:01] to 10 so which is really high I don't
[23:03] think I let it be that high let's say
[23:04] even five right if I include two more
[23:07] parameters per mixture that's another 10
[23:10] parameters I have to estimate right yeah
[23:12] um and this is a massive model with a
[23:14] obviously a ton of parameters here so
[23:17] it's not just 10 more parameters it's a
[23:20] bunch more layers with a bunch more
[23:21] information right um ideally if you had
[23:23] more data you would do that but to
[23:25] answer your what would that look like
[23:28] know if it would actually add that much
[23:29] to the model yeah right I don't know so
[23:31] I I did do it and basically what it does
[23:34] is instead of having you can instead of
[23:36] having just vertically if I drew on
[23:38] these distributions a vertical line and
[23:40] then a horizontal line they would be
[23:42] perfectly like this right but it it
[23:44] would basically allow me to take these
[23:46] distributions and shift them on a
[23:47] diagonal right is is how that would look
[23:50] which I think is more realistic like I
[23:52] can imagine there being a correlation
[23:54] between like you get further down the
[23:56] field you're probably going to be
[23:57] further to the to the on average it'll
[23:59] be further towards the lines because
[24:00] you're going to go away from stuff but
[24:01] I'm not sure it makes I'm not sure it
[24:03] would add enough to yeah make it all
[24:05] that in our limited data situation I
[24:07] would say I I'm hesitant to do it if I
[24:09] had more I would but the other thing is
[24:11] like there's plenty of assumptions here
[24:13] that you can be play you can play with
[24:14] right like um and if I had more data I
[24:17] would for example I don't necessarily
[24:19] think that the mixture should be normal
[24:21] it's just kind of a it's kind of a
[24:23] simple uh way to kind of implement it
[24:25] for the first time but really if the
[24:27] tackle mean here then there's probably
[24:30] more of a of a like a like a flashlight
[24:33] type distribution from that sample mean
[24:36] right it's probably skewed so there's a
[24:37] lot of assumptions here for sure that if
[24:40] I had more data I would love to try new
[24:42] things with um but I will say that um I
[24:45] don't have that luxury right um so we'll
[24:48] talk to Mike Lopez we'll see what yeah
[24:50] I'll I'll send him an angry email and
[24:51] see how that goes um we'll tweet at him
[24:54] yeah okay sounds good but but yeah
[24:59] we're go we're going to Mike Lopez's
[25:01] house where does he live con he lives in
[25:02] Connecticut that's pitchforks or yeah
[25:05] yeah with some pitchforks I have another
[25:07] question if no one else has any I'm just
[25:08] going to keep asking questions
[25:18] until I can hear
[25:26] yeah yeah maybe like something laian or
[25:29] something like that there was actually
[25:31] in the lineman Big Data Bard there was a
[25:34] submission where somebody used a
[25:35] distribution that was was it the Dorito
[25:38] distribution that they called it I can't
[25:40] remember but it basically looked like a
[25:41] Dorito like it was it was like the mean
[25:44] was here and then it was like some gamma
[25:47] normal distribution basically the idea
[25:48] is I mean who cares what the
[25:50] distribution is the point is that the
[25:52] first point of contact you shouldn't
[25:54] have an equal likelihood of going
[25:55] backwards as you do go forwards right so
[25:57] that's I mean we can get mathy with it
[26:00] but at the end of the day that's what
[26:01] you want so you're looking for a
[26:02] distribution that does that
[26:04] probably I just I just have a fin what
[26:07] um so every for every play You're
[26:10] estimate you're not estimating a single
[26:11] K you're estimating a k for every
[26:12] different play uh or is there so there's
[26:15] a set K that you cross validate right
[26:17] well what is the value of K that you end
[26:19] up with so I cross I cross validated it
[26:21] to be so I initially cross validated it
[26:24] to be pretty high but um I limited it to
[26:26] a Max of five mhm because obviously the
[26:30] more mixtures the more parameters um but
[26:33] the the one thing I do want to emphasize
[26:34] and that was the point of those examples
[26:36] is that just because you have five
[26:37] distributions doesn't mean you're using
[26:39] five distributions it just means for for
[26:41] any given play you have the chance to
[26:44] estimate five distributions but for
[26:46] another play four of them the the
[26:48] mixture values there the weight
[26:50] distributions of K could be zero meaning
[26:52] that those tackles are basically
[26:55] completely impossible to happen but in
[26:57] Cross validation you chose a value of K
[27:00] what was that value that ended up five
[27:01] it was five okay okay I think it it did
[27:03] cross valid validate to be uh higher a
[27:06] couple times but I limited it to five oh
[27:08] so five is just five is not what the
[27:10] cross validation told you it was you cut
[27:12] it off because computationally you
[27:13] didn't want to fit 10 I think I did
[27:15] maybe one through 10 and it might have
[27:17] selected seven and I said five and you
[27:19] were just like okay okay and there was
[27:20] like probably not much of a difference
[27:21] between five and seven because most of
[27:23] these are going to be exactly I would
[27:24] imagine most of them are unimodal or
[27:27] bodal at most yeah it would have been
[27:29] sacrificing uh okay we got move it would
[27:31] have been we're getting yed at
[27:33] sacrificing bias for variance is what
[27:35] you would have been doing by estimating
[27:37] more parameters is what I would say but
[27:39] yep
[27:44] anyway after I finished all this coding
[27:47] I didn't consider anything else I I
[27:48] threw the code in my backpack and called
[27:50] it a day but maybe next time that's a
[27:53] it's a good idea though you should you
[27:54] should look at that all right sorry all
[27:56] right we're getting yelled at we're
[27:57] getting yelled it's time to move on
[27:59] who's I don't know my phone's dead who's
[28:01] next next Smith's next okay uh Smith our
[28:05] next speaker is uh Smith bage is that
[28:07] right um and you are I'm gonna say an
[28:11] undergraduate at
[28:15] um Duke NC State is it South is it South
[28:19] is it down there Wake Forest Northeast
[28:21] oh not even close um NYU of course
[28:25] obviously NYU uh this is Joint work your
[28:28] your partner is in London right now
[28:31] living he's living the dream living the
[28:33] high life in London he couldn't be here
[28:35] so you're stuck in stores instead not
[28:37] that nothing's nothing wrong with stores
[28:39] but stores is great you have to live
[28:41] here you know whatever I was here for
[28:42] four years um there anything else you
[28:44] want me to say about you before you all
[28:46] right Smitha Josh is gonna talk about we
[28:47] need to get your slides up don't we yeah
[28:49] I think we
[28:50] can we can get them
[28:55] up which one to do this no you're not
[28:58] tackles is it
[29:01] f11 control F control
[29:04] L the presentation thing all right go
[29:07] SMI is GNA talk about spatial Edge
[29:09] technique a framework to evaluate Edge
[29:11] sets please welcome Smith
[29:19] bage it's fine it's fine it's fine thank
[29:21] you all right hi guys um thank you for
[29:24] the uh incredible introduction Gregory
[29:26] I'm SMI undergrad at NYU and today we're
[29:29] going to be talking about set it's a
[29:31] metric to evaluate Edge Setters
[29:33] curiosity how many of you are familiar
[29:35] with the concept of edge setting or
[29:36] setting the edge in football okay so
[29:39] just about just about half more than
[29:41] half that's good so we're going to watch
[29:42] some football and kind of discuss what
[29:44] this process is like so the first play
[29:49] here if the GIF will
[29:51] load which I'm wor it might not okay I'm
[29:55] going to walk through this just with a
[29:57] still image so so you can see where the
[29:59] cursor is at right now this player is
[30:01] Dar Holmes he's the edge Setter on this
[30:04] play uh right here's running back Travis
[30:06] etn He makes his way over to the left
[30:08] side and so the defensive back in this
[30:10] in this position his goal is to restrict
[30:13] access towards the outside part of the
[30:15] field because you can see just off the
[30:17] pre- snap distribution in the middle is
[30:19] where all the linebackers and interior
[30:21] defensive lineman are on the outside is
[30:23] accessing space that's open space that
[30:25] you want to get to so the job of a Dar
[30:27] homes
[30:28] um in this scenario is to restrict
[30:31] access to the outside space you can see
[30:33] at the top of the screen it did not
[30:35] happen Travis etn ran for a 40 49 yard
[30:38] run um and the next example I'm going to
[30:40] show was the opposite where Aiden
[30:43] Hutchinson of course I wish we had the J
[30:44] F but Aiden Hutchinson kind of stormed
[30:47] through the defensive line uh restricted
[30:48] Tony PD from going to his end for some
[30:51] numbers on it uh changed Tony Po's
[30:53] Direction by 50° and he decreased his
[30:55] acceleration by 25% so we saw him like
[30:59] shuffled his feet stopped and then went
[31:01] to the left side ultimately losing one
[31:03] yard these two plays were very different
[31:05] the one thing I'd like to point out is
[31:07] in neither of these examples Aiden
[31:09] Hutchinson doesn't appear in the uh in
[31:11] the description here and darn Holmes is
[31:14] name doesn't appear here but they were
[31:15] very pivotable pivotal um players to
[31:18] this end result and so this highlights a
[31:22] broader result a broader disconnect
[31:24] between the film room and the
[31:25] spreadsheets where basically they told
[31:27] different stories on the spreadsheets on
[31:29] the one hand Deshawn Elliot got credit
[31:31] for a tackle for loss and he can go to
[31:33] contract negotiations and say he got
[31:35] this credit for tackle for loss when in
[31:37] reality Aiden Hutchinson was the one who
[31:39] impacted the play in the first place and
[31:41] then in this example darne Holmes kind
[31:42] of gets out unscathed when he was the
[31:44] one who made the mistake it was a 49
[31:46] yard run um but that discredit doesn't
[31:48] get come back to him now you can watch
[31:50] film um and if it was loading you could
[31:52] see like and manually attribute or
[31:54] distribute credit accordingly but one
[31:57] this process is very labor intensive it
[31:59] requires hundreds and hundreds of manual
[32:00] film watching that may be but may be put
[32:03] to better use and two it's
[32:05] non-quantifiable so you can't compare
[32:08] across different teams and see which
[32:10] players are better or worse at this
[32:12] specific um this specific task so our
[32:15] solution was to quantify off ball
[32:17] contributions and more specifically we
[32:19] wanted to see okay how well does a
[32:21] player set the edge how well do they
[32:23] restrict the running back from getting
[32:25] to their intended destination on the
[32:27] outside third of the
[32:29] field and so we started thinking about
[32:32] it as a film evaluator might we asked
[32:34] two questions the first of which is how
[32:36] well did the edge Setter actually get
[32:37] into
[32:38] position and then how well or did the
[32:40] runner change direction to the inside
[32:42] because ultimately that's your goal here
[32:43] you don't want the running back to get
[32:45] outside of you you want to force them
[32:46] back inside to where all that traffic
[32:48] and congestion ultimately is and so we
[32:51] thought it we watched film on it we
[32:52] thought about it logically and then we
[32:54] kind of moved towards um we moved
[32:56] towards the math so this is a voro
[32:59] region and you can basically think of
[33:00] this as what space does a player
[33:02] currently control in at a certain frame
[33:04] and time and so this example was Dar
[33:08] Holmes who was highlighted in red and so
[33:10] you could
[33:11] see I really wish we had the moveing J
[33:14] really wish we had it um but you can see
[33:17] as Travis etn turn the corner uh this
[33:20] voro region kind of grew to the size of
[33:23] what's on the bottom here and then
[33:25] shrunk to being very little so basically
[33:27] we use this as kind of a method of um of
[33:29] describing how much space does the Ed
[33:31] Setter currently
[33:32] control this is a 2d gausin
[33:35] distribution you can kind of think of it
[33:37] as like a highlighter for valuing space
[33:40] so this is a Runners you take their
[33:42] speed and direction and you project out
[33:45] where they want to be five frames in the
[33:47] future half a second in the future so
[33:49] because you can project where the
[33:50] running back's intention is to be you
[33:52] can project okay what space should the
[33:54] edge shutter control as a
[33:56] result and and then for us it was as
[33:59] simple as just overlapping these two
[34:01] basically saying okay how well did the
[34:02] edge Setter get into position all you
[34:04] need to do is see the overlap on display
[34:06] so you can see for whatever reason the
[34:07] Aiden Hutchinson score the overlap
[34:09] percentage does increase um the GIF
[34:12] underneath it I think it was too big of
[34:13] a gif it's it's not loading here um but
[34:16] in a frame by frame scenario you can see
[34:19] these two start to converge and then
[34:21] you're left with a percentage and that
[34:22] percentage is ultimately answers our
[34:24] question of how well did the edge that
[34:25] are getting to position so Aiden Hutchin
[34:27] reaches I think like 15% um on this
[34:31] plan so with that first question decided
[34:34] you can move towards a second question
[34:35] which is did the runner change direction
[34:37] to the inside this is more the action
[34:39] phase of our investigation like what
[34:40] actually happened so you can see how way
[34:42] you're in position but now what and so
[34:44] this middle graphic I think displays it
[34:46] well where this red Vector is where Tony
[34:49] PD's intended destination was when he
[34:51] received the handoff once he saw Aiden
[34:53] Hutchinson then he kind of veered to the
[34:55] left and then you can calculate angle
[34:58] change I think it was something it says
[34:59] 32.4 de something along those lines so
[35:02] you continually calculate okay what
[35:04] direction uh or to what extent did the
[35:06] runner change direction to the inside
[35:09] and then from there you can standardize
[35:10] this we just did a 0o to one scale
[35:11] anything below zero means the running La
[35:13] is going outside and you don't want that
[35:15] so we just labeled that a zero and then
[35:18] 90 degrees is a complete perpendicular
[35:21] change in Direction and that's as good
[35:22] as a one in our score um and then you
[35:24] just normalize it so 45.5
[35:27] UH 60 would be 66 etc
[35:31] etc this one's loading cool okay so to
[35:35] get our final score you take the overlap
[35:38] percentage that we discussed and now you
[35:40] can kind of see it in a more frame by
[35:41] frame scenario you take the standardized
[35:43] angle you add it up for Simplicity we
[35:46] just added it up and then you get a
[35:47] final cumulative set score and I'll let
[35:50] this run because I think it displays
[35:51] kind of our step-by-step thinking but
[35:54] this is an example of looking at this in
[35:56] the film room thinking about how to
[35:58] solve it using numbers and then getting
[36:00] to getting to a number basically because
[36:02] once you get to this number we just ran
[36:04] basically this iteration through every
[36:05] single player that qualified for this
[36:07] and you get a ranking um of the top
[36:10] players for this and so this passes a
[36:13] sniffs test because you can see Josh
[36:14] sweat is at top he's like a 65 like 250
[36:18] run stopper and the guys on the left
[36:20] generally fit that M right Aiden
[36:22] Hutchinson's there montz sweat's there
[36:24] these are generally run Stoppers as
[36:26] opposed to maybe premier pass rushers
[36:28] they're still good pass rushers but um
[36:30] it fit the sniff sniff test there and
[36:33] then on the right side is more binary
[36:34] this is kind of easy to understand where
[36:35] it's like Brian Burns 86% of the time
[36:38] set the edge successfully so this is a
[36:40] one or a zero and if we go back to the
[36:42] process of this it's did the Ed Setter
[36:46] have influence or have overlap and then
[36:50] did they force the runner to the inside
[36:52] so you don't calculate the extent to
[36:53] which they did perhaps so someone like
[36:55] an Aiden Hutchinson when he forced Tony
[36:57] significantly towards the inside we get
[36:59] a better score um but it calculates just
[37:03] kind of a binary success score and then
[37:05] this is set GPT that we made before the
[37:08] combine for fun so you could throw into
[37:10] it and ask hey I'm game planning for the
[37:12] Broncos what should I do it says to
[37:14] Target Bradley chub and if the GIF would
[37:17] run which it won't and Travis etn got
[37:20] another like 50 yard run here which you
[37:21] wouldn't expect Bradley chub is a
[37:23] decently good Edge Defender um and yeah
[37:26] this was this was was fun um but that
[37:29] about concludes what I'm going to be
[37:31] talking like what I talked about for the
[37:32] project again I apologize for the gifs I
[37:35] think it would have been a lot more
[37:36] intuitive with the gifs but um feel free
[37:39] to talk to me afterwards or anything
[37:41] about about the project as well but I
[37:42] did want to get
[37:44] into a more personal side of it which is
[37:47] lessons from the Big Data B and just
[37:48] kind of general like learnings because
[37:50] it was a very like transformative
[37:52] process from start to finish and I think
[37:53] there's a lot of kind of takeaways and
[37:55] I'm sure you two can talk about it as
[37:56] well um
[38:01] um Ronald
[38:05] yes yeah I just had a
[38:10] question hello hello Ronald hello can
[38:14] you hear me yes I just had a question
[38:17] yep well through through your research
[38:19] what do you see as like the big picture
[38:21] outcome for This research like the the
[38:24] Practical um application this would this
[38:26] be something for the just fantasy
[38:28] players trying to figure out who they
[38:29] should put on their team or the roster
[38:31] for the week or it be something that
[38:33] like a team would use to overlook
[38:35] highlights when they're preparing for
[38:36] the next game or would this be something
[38:37] that opponent would look at to see how
[38:40] to better defend it's a good question I
[38:42] think this is probably one of the best
[38:45] applications you're going to have if if
[38:46] you're struggling on run defense because
[38:48] you notice that you know your
[38:50] quarterback are getting exposed too
[38:51] often play after play you're going to
[38:53] want a a more quality Edge Setter you
[38:55] can find some value within this
[38:58] um where Chris Wormley for example isn't
[39:00] going to be super super expensive and he
[39:02] might improve your run game um or your
[39:04] run defense more than your your
[39:06] replaceable uh person so I think it's on
[39:09] the team side for the most part I think
[39:10] game planning as well this was obviously
[39:12] like a tried example using GPT but I
[39:15] think the concept remains where Bradley
[39:17] chub was surprisingly like 110th out of
[39:20] all Edge Setters and and you could see
[39:22] why when you look at the next week okay
[39:23] like what was happening he kind of shot
[39:25] inside in this play so I think for those
[39:27] two things I think it's definitely team
[39:29] side I don't think it's consumer side
[39:30] but it's it's recognizing holes in
[39:32] opposing teams run defense and then from
[39:34] there um maybe you want to make some
[39:36] value ads in in free
[39:38] agency is that answer your
[39:43] question I'll take your silence as a yes
[39:46] yeah okay so I'll move on to the to the
[39:48] more um personal lessons here and I'll
[39:51] start with a story I I told you I'm from
[39:54] the Northeast grew up outside of
[39:56] Philadelphia go Birds um
[39:58] and uh about two years ago there's a
[40:01] conference Wen Sports business
[40:03] conference um I'm I told you originally
[40:06] from outside of Philadelphia go to
[40:08] school at NYU so I figured why not take
[40:10] the train over um about an hour and a
[40:12] half train get there at like 9 9:30 and
[40:16] settle in and then this man Mark lazri
[40:19] anyone familiar with Mark lazri thr fans
[40:22] nice so one person I wasn't either but
[40:25] apparently he was the co-owner of the
[40:26] Milwaukee box and more more and more I
[40:27] looked into him um CEO of Avenue Capital
[40:30] Group which is a head hedge fund that
[40:32] buys distressed debt and so he was the
[40:35] kind of keynote speaker here and more
[40:37] and more I looked into him the more
[40:38] interested I was it's not every day you
[40:40] can kind of have a somewhat personal
[40:42] conversation with a guy whose net worth
[40:43] is like $2 billion dollar and owns and
[40:45] runs a basketball team and so the
[40:49] conversation went well at the end he
[40:51] asked if there are any questions and
[40:52] raise my hand um I I thought the
[40:54] conversation was really insightful so
[40:56] raise my hand and asked like if he had
[40:58] any lessons for someone who's kind of
[41:00] like us like an undergrad still trying
[41:02] to figure out what to do and kind of how
[41:04] to approach postgraduate career and he
[41:07] said there's two types of people in this
[41:09] world he said there's the number
[41:11] crunchers and the
[41:12] storytellers and the number crunchers
[41:15] think the storytellers are idiots as
[41:16] maybe some of us do um because they can
[41:20] tell a story but it's never grounded in
[41:22] any truth it's kind of untethered from
[41:24] any sort of reality and then he said the
[41:26] Storyteller think the number crunchers
[41:28] are stupid because you can run the best
[41:30] model in the world but if you can't
[41:31] explain the results of it then it's as
[41:33] good as useless and he kept going on on
[41:37] this on there was a binary distinction
[41:39] between the number crunchers and and and
[41:40] the
[41:41] storytellers and afterwards he started
[41:44] talking about professions as well like
[41:46] they either fall into one category or
[41:47] the other and eventually the chat uh
[41:49] kind of ended ran out but this concept
[41:51] kind of stuck in my head that there's
[41:52] kind of two groups of people uh within
[41:54] this world and I did like a little bit
[41:56] of like a mock draft in my head the
[41:59] lawyers go to the storytellers because
[42:01] they talk to people around a fact
[42:03] pattern and kind of make up a story
[42:04] about what happen there's not often very
[42:06] many numbers involved I'm sure there is
[42:09] but you get the point where generally
[42:11] they side on storytelling hedge funds
[42:13] have moved towards a number of crunches
[42:15] right a lot of Quant firms there's
[42:16] billions and billions of dollars being
[42:18] traded on a per second uh volume
[42:20] nowadays when previously maybe that was
[42:23] more on the Storyteller side next up I
[42:26] guess we're doing a snake
[42:27] um we have like software Engineers again
[42:30] more on The Logical thinking sort of
[42:31] side and then after that we have venture
[42:34] capitalist again if you're investing in
[42:36] a startup you're investing in meta
[42:38] Airbnb whatever you're investing in a
[42:40] story hoping that story works out and
[42:42] you get R and so the more and more I
[42:44] thought about it the more and more it
[42:45] made sense where it's like you can be
[42:47] pushed to one side or or kind of pushed
[42:49] to the other and then this was me in the
[42:51] middle I went
[42:52] undrafted because I was thinking about
[42:54] where I was in here because I liked I
[42:56] really loved coding but I liked
[42:59] storytelling I like to write I like to
[43:00] kind of Express that and like in high
[43:03] school that was a common um barometer
[43:05] that even Lazarus said who was a lawyer
[43:07] himself he said that if you want to
[43:09] figure out which one you are in high
[43:11] school was your favorite subject English
[43:13] or was it math mine was English but I
[43:15] really like to code I study data science
[43:17] so where where do I fall um and
[43:20] ultimately thinking about getting a
[43:22] career in sports I thought about it in a
[43:24] sport setting you have sales corporate
[43:26] sales sponsorship sales that's more
[43:27] storytelling right you're in the trench
[43:29] is dealing day-to-day with people as
[43:31] opposed to numbers and then finally
[43:33] analytics obviously the theme of this
[43:34] conference number crunches like that's
[43:37] very clearly or so I thought always
[43:39] always always on on the left hand side
[43:41] on this pioner distinction and I think
[43:44] the biggest takeaway from this
[43:46] competition for me is
[43:49] that it's more of a spectrum I'm
[43:51] surprised that worked it's more of a
[43:53] spectrum it's not a binary distinction
[43:55] and analytics I think is is in the
[43:57] middle more than anything else and I
[43:59] have a little bit of logic I think
[44:01] backing this up this is the kagle
[44:04] competition from Google and two Sigma
[44:05] more on that left hand side with number
[44:07] crunchers the primary score or the
[44:10] metric here that they kind of grade you
[44:12] on is an accuracy score it's log loss
[44:15] Brier score whatever it is but it's just
[44:17] a very simple score um top to bottom
[44:20] leaderboard no story behind it you
[44:22] submit your code your jupyter notebook
[44:24] and then kind of that's that big data B
[44:26] is very different where I think 20% of
[44:28] it 25% of it was your submission was the
[44:32] 2,000w essay effectively that you submit
[44:36] um and I think 10 to 20% was also in
[44:39] data visz so it's not just about your
[44:42] Jupiter notebook or what you submit in
[44:44] Python but it's also how are you
[44:45] expressing it right what story are you
[44:47] telling with the
[44:49] data I think there's three kind of Lang
[44:53] three translations you have to make
[44:55] versus if you're submitting in a Google
[44:57] or two Sigma competition it's all just
[44:59] your code again you submit your duper in
[45:01] a notebook you call it a day hope to get
[45:02] the best accuracy score and then move on
[45:05] but here you have to translate it to
[45:06] English because you have to think about
[45:07] it in that kind of logical way and then
[45:09] you have to make that one more
[45:10] translation which I think is pretty hard
[45:11] is translating it to football and I put
[45:13] a picture of Bill bich here because I
[45:15] think he's he is pretty analytical but
[45:18] like if you look at him you don't think
[45:19] that at all and so it's like the bill
[45:21] bich test test if you present this to
[45:23] bill bich would he understand it does he
[45:26] care about your normalization of
[45:27] features or whatever no he just cares
[45:28] about the output and how well you
[45:30] communicate
[45:32] that and I think this is an example of
[45:36] like we did not want to present this
[45:40] because who wants to look at that right
[45:42] and and we can explain that and it and
[45:44] it makes sense and this crowd I think
[45:46] understands that more than most but you
[45:47] want to see the pretty visualization
[45:49] that should move on the right hand side
[45:51] um because that's what a coach and and
[45:53] and player and front office would would
[45:55] really understand there's of action will
[45:57] take away and I think I think at least
[45:59] for me my ego gets attached to the left
[46:02] because you want to show look this is
[46:03] the formula I created I feel so good
[46:04] about it but in reality you want to make
[46:06] it look pretty um with with different
[46:09] visualizations and things of that
[46:11] nature here's another example and this
[46:13] is a St immage so I can explain this one
[46:15] a little more going back to the to the
[46:17] Big Data Bowl as well this is the darney
[46:19] Holmes I example I brought up in the the
[46:21] first slide but you can see um this is
[46:25] the formula we use it's just a shoelace
[46:26] algorithm it's nothing too crazy but
[46:28] again kind of looks complicated but in
[46:30] reality it's just attributing area to a
[46:33] certain player on the field and then
[46:34] from there we chose voro regions for the
[46:37] purpose of that yellow line is kind of a
[46:40] leverage line you can see if that
[46:42] Defender is outside leverage or inside
[46:43] leverage and you don't really need a PhD
[46:45] in math or anything to understand it it
[46:47] makes a lot of intuitive sense you see
[46:49] it where's the angle facing and then
[46:51] from there you can determine okay what
[46:52] kind of Leverage does this defensive
[46:54] back have and in this case you can see
[46:56] how much space Dar Holmes lost in the
[47:00] frame 30 he controls all of that outside
[47:02] space as you can see indicated by the
[47:04] red um area and then as what we call the
[47:07] door getting swept open when he loses
[47:09] his his leverage um it gets overtaken by
[47:11] the pulling offensive tackle I think it
[47:13] was cam Robinson then etn got outside
[47:15] and got got a 50- yard run but again uh
[47:18] hope this displays the the purpose of
[47:20] turning that into what's hopefully
[47:23] actionable and
[47:24] understandable so this is kind of how we
[47:26] thought about it where I I played
[47:28] football I was the guy I was darney
[47:30] Holmes when I played I was on the
[47:31] outside um trying to set the edge
[47:34] because my coach said if you have to
[47:36] make a tackle then we probably messed up
[47:37] on the play which didn't feel too great
[47:40] but um thought about it first in
[47:42] football language right thought like how
[47:44] a coach might and there was a really
[47:46] really good video it got taken down for
[47:48] some reason I think it was copyright
[47:49] issues but um there was a really good
[47:51] video where all like 32 coaches were
[47:54] talking about this exact thing setting
[47:56] the edge and they got really really
[47:57] animated and excited about it and so
[48:00] that was a good signal to where okay
[48:01] this matters like we as fans may not
[48:03] think it matters that much but if
[48:04] they're getting this excited about it
[48:06] then it likely does matter so then from
[48:08] there it's okay we want to think about
[48:09] setting the edge thought back to to my
[48:11] playing days and we came up with these
[48:13] questions are you in position and did
[48:15] you change the angle because when you
[48:16] watch the game those are the kind of
[48:18] thoughts that come in your head and then
[48:20] afterwards then we finally moved it to
[48:22] to python or whatever language you use
[48:25] but then you use the math and numbers to
[48:26] kind of figure it out and then this
[48:28] workflow worked well for us and I do
[48:32] think it's football or baseball whatever
[48:34] sport you want to think specific where
[48:37] you have to think about the problem in a
[48:38] very logical like application sense
[48:41] first and then you can move back to to
[48:43] using math using the numbers to kind of
[48:45] get to a to a sound conclusion um does
[48:48] anyone know this
[48:51] play okay yeah just to jog your memory
[48:53] the article title is did the officials
[48:55] screw Eagles with questionable hoing
[48:58] call the answer is yes and I thought
[49:02] this was a good kind of closing slide
[49:04] because it demonstrates the Dual nature
[49:07] of it where the Eagles are seen as a
[49:09] very analytically sound organization
[49:12] they got to this point joean Herz is on
[49:13] a rookie contract whole point being
[49:15] there you pay him $4 million Patrick
[49:18] Mahomes is making $50 million but
[49:20] Patrick Mahomes is not like 12 and a
[49:22] half times better than Joe and Herz so
[49:23] you get some value there James Bradberry
[49:26] good value sign he's on the screen here
[49:28] um and throughout the season the Eagles
[49:30] made little little moves and little
[49:31] changes that contributed to a to a
[49:33] Powerhouse of a season meanwhile the
[49:35] Chiefs on the other hand lost their star
[49:37] receiver come in with Patrick Mahomes on
[49:39] effectively one ankle at this point um
[49:42] but yet because of a random and
[49:45] arbitrary decision like this on a third
[49:47] and eight the Chiefs ended up winning
[49:49] the Super Bowl um and and then I was
[49:52] really sad that night but I I'd like to
[49:55] emphasize that
[49:57] throughout all of this like solving of
[49:58] the game and using these numbers A
[50:00] Moment Like This or just a very
[50:01] arbitrary moment where just like a
[50:03] display of of human error human Humanity
[50:05] 50/50 you you don't really know right
[50:07] like this thing is unsolvable and going
[50:09] back to software engineering or or Quant
[50:12] trading or all these other kind of
[50:13] disciplines it's it's very solvable you
[50:15] get to an answer you move on you're very
[50:16] happy with it or you get to within a
[50:18] decent confidence interval and you feel
[50:20] good about it but here that there is no
[50:22] model there is no kind of number that
[50:24] could have been used to predict this
[50:25] play happening or the Chiefs winning as
[50:28] a result and so this I think this game
[50:30] is very very random and I think that's
[50:32] why like it exists in the middle between
[50:34] the numbers and the narrative because
[50:36] there just is an element of Randomness
[50:38] that we can't control and I think the
[50:40] one thing we did in this this big
[50:42] datable kind of um process was lean into
[50:44] that Randomness and I think that's why
[50:47] why we did
[50:48] well yeah that's it all right thank you
[50:54] guys does anyone have any question
[51:04] questions hey um I was just curious if
[51:07] your like set um grades match similarly
[51:11] to like the run defense grades of like
[51:12] PFF yeah ESPN has one too run block win
[51:16] rate it did it did I I we we ran some
[51:19] like exact analysis to get a number but
[51:21] qualitatively yeah like the names you
[51:22] saw at the top of the list another group
[51:24] did Edge setting as well and they
[51:25] presented another
[51:27] very shared names so that that I think
[51:29] validated our
[51:31] process anyone
[51:33] else yeah I have another question yep go
[51:37] ahead you talked about your takeaways
[51:39] from the actual conference itself and
[51:41] what it taught you about the the um the
[51:45] careers and the um whole idea of sports
[51:47] analytics as a whole do you do you think
[51:51] that that that was something that you
[51:53] wouldn't have um figured out it had you
[51:56] not gone to that conference and is this
[51:57] invaluable information to you now that
[52:00] you as you go forward in your career
[52:03] yeah it's a good question I think so
[52:04] yeah I think what you learn by doing and
[52:07] oftentimes you can like try to
[52:08] appreciate the randomness or whatnot but
[52:11] you you really can't um so yeah I think
[52:14] actually getting in the weeds of a
[52:16] project kind of helped me understand
[52:18] that um like it this kind of sits in
[52:20] between the numbers and the
[52:23] narrative um my question is just kind of
[52:26] about like backdooring blocks like how
[52:28] you showed darn Holmes try and back door
[52:30] it and fail but like what about players
[52:32] like I mean anecdotally like JJ Watt
[52:34] would back door the block and get the
[52:35] tackle does your metric account for that
[52:38] it it punishes it if it's not successful
[52:40] which I think it should again this
[52:43] example I'll go back um jeez last
[52:47] slides this example with Bradley chub
[52:49] exact situation I think that's why he
[52:50] got penalized by it so much because he
[52:52] tried to backo it maybe does play he
[52:54] tried to backo it um and it was
[52:56] unsuccessful Travis CN got the edge so
[52:59] it generally is pretty harsh on it but I
[53:00] think it should because that is going to
[53:02] be a risk or reward type of play so does
[53:04] it reward it when they do make those
[53:06] tackles because then they're very
[53:07] heavily in the influence area um or they
[53:10] can force running back inside either or
[53:11] and and we did a sign um I didn't get to
[53:13] it if you did make the tackle on a play
[53:15] where you're supposed to set the edge
[53:16] you got a score of one as well which is
[53:19] just as good obviously as forcing the
[53:20] run in the other direction because you
[53:22] achieved the outcome thank you
[53:24] yep anyone else
[53:28] can I ask a question or do we have a
[53:30] little bit of time okay
[53:32] um you go back to you have the there's
[53:34] the two components of the I probably
[53:36] asked this a big data ball there's the
[53:38] two components of your your metric and
[53:41] are you you're waiting them equally yes
[53:43] so we are what we thought about doing
[53:46] was manually flagging plays where a
[53:49] Defender did successfully set the edge
[53:50] and then waiting these variables
[53:52] accordingly uh based on which matters
[53:54] more which doesn't it's very again and
[53:56] this is kind of why we created in the
[53:57] first place a very manual process so it
[53:59] just became too tedious to flag 50 to
[54:01] 100 exact examples and then kind of get
[54:03] comfortable waiting behind this um but
[54:06] yeah yeah because I I would just think
[54:08] that there's some I have no idea which
[54:11] one it would be but I would imagine that
[54:13] like you're basically saying that 1% of
[54:15] overlap is the same thing
[54:18] as 01 of an angle right and I would
[54:21] imagine that one is more important than
[54:22] the other I have no idea which right but
[54:25] I think that'd be a really cool uh like
[54:27] next step to make it a little bit more
[54:28] interesting right 100% yeah 100% all
[54:30] right anyone else have any
[54:31] questions all right let's thank
[54:38] Smith I haven't called you up yet it's
[54:42] my turn
[54:44] so ready for ready for your
[54:49] introduction I want I want
[54:52] to all right I'll stall I'll stall for
[54:54] you uh our our third speaker in this in
[54:57] this session is uh future Dr Kang hin um
[55:02] well maybe not maybe you're going to
[55:03] fill some stuff Quang was a uh ma
[55:06] undergraduate student at I don't
[55:08] remember Quang Wittenberg University he
[55:10] was a graduate student he did his
[55:12] Masters at lyol University of
[55:14] Chicago uh in the Department of
[55:16] Mathematics and statistics where I am
[55:18] the greatest day of my life was when he
[55:20] graduated and left uh and went to do a
[55:23] PhD at Carnegie melon in uh the
[55:26] department of statistics and data
[55:27] science is that what their department is
[55:29] called now uh I've worked on several
[55:31] papers with Kang we did some stuff that
[55:34] uh made the finals at the Carnegie melon
[55:36] Sports analytics conference um we worked
[55:40] on some the talk I gave earlier today
[55:42] was joint work with Quang and um we did
[55:45] a big data Bowl two years ago where we
[55:46] made the finals I was not involved in
[55:49] this one he dropped me from the team
[55:51] thought he could move on and be better
[55:52] without me and he made the finals
[55:54] without me which is that you don't need
[55:56] me to win anything um I've saw long
[56:00] enough uh this is Quang win he's going
[56:02] to talk about uh fractional
[56:05] tackles let's welcome
[56:10] Quang all right uh thank you GRE for the
[56:14] uh kind
[56:15] introduction um so yeah I today I'm
[56:18] going to talk about um fractional
[56:20] tackles um which is uh my submission to
[56:24] this year's big durable competition
[56:26] um uh this belongs in the metric track I
[56:29] should say um so nix's uh submission was
[56:32] also metric track this year and Smith
[56:34] was the undergraduates track um yeah and
[56:38] I'm from K like Greg said um and I'm
[56:40] second year PhD student in a statistics
[56:43] and data science
[56:44] department okay let's get started um
[56:48] so I'm going to quickly give you an
[56:51] overview of traditional metrics for
[56:54] tackling so the most basic um tackling
[56:59] metrics um out there are tackles solo
[57:03] tackles or assisted tackles such just
[57:06] assists um these are binary outcomes
[57:10] observed at the end of the play so these
[57:12] are just box score statistics and
[57:14] surprisingly these are not official
[57:17] statistics um from the NFL so at each
[57:20] game the home team sort of
[57:23] designates um a scorekeeper to um keep
[57:27] track of these statistics um one thing I
[57:30] I should say also is that if you combine
[57:32] these two if you just add tackle synesis
[57:35] together some people sometimes call
[57:37] those uh combined uh tackles and then
[57:41] there exists a few versions of uh
[57:44] statistics that sort of try to improve
[57:47] uh these binary outcomes so stats bombs
[57:49] um when they calculate their combined
[57:52] statistics uh combined tackles um they
[57:55] treat uh
[57:56] an assist as a half as opposed to just a
[57:59] one um originally PFF um created
[58:03] something called stops which um um I
[58:06] think only tracks uh the tackles when
[58:09] the play does not end in a positive
[58:12] yardage gained 40 offensive team and PF
[58:15] also tracked something called Miss
[58:16] tackles which um the name itself is
[58:18] pretty
[58:19] explanatory the common theme of these
[58:21] meas is that these are only discreet
[58:24] outcomes um measure at the play level um
[58:28] thus are and some of them are like for
[58:31] tackles for example it's pretty um
[58:33] pretty it's based on sort of subjective
[58:36] judgment um from the scorekeeper so
[58:38] there are definitely um lots of
[58:40] limitations with these
[58:42] statistics so in order to
[58:46] um evaluate tackling Within the play um
[58:50] we decided to think first think more
[58:52] carefully about the purpose of tackling
[58:54] in American football so if you go
[58:57] through the um NFL rule book this is the
[58:59] screenshot I took uh from the website um
[59:02] you see that um that is phrase saying
[59:05] that tackling is an attempt by a
[59:06] defensive player to hold a runner to
[59:08] hold his advance or bring him to the
[59:11] ground okay so to quickly sum summarize
[59:15] so the purpose of tackling is what that
[59:18] is to Halt the forward motion of the
[59:20] ball
[59:21] carrier and this Forward Motion can be
[59:24] measured uh
[59:26] Thea the velocity of the ball carrier
[59:29] towards the end zone which can be um
[59:31] directly derived using the player track
[59:33] since we have information about the
[59:35] velocity of player and also the angle
[59:38] they are U
[59:40] motioning okay so the goal of this
[59:42] project is to propose a framework to um
[59:46] meal tackling contribution throughout
[59:47] the play and we also want to assign
[59:50] defensive credit um to Defenders for
[59:53] haling the ball car's uh forward motion
[59:56] and this would allow us to uh eventually
[59:58] derive a continuous metric for um
[60:02] defensive performance that sort of moves
[60:04] beyond the um traditional um binary
[60:07] tackle Des
[60:09] designation okay so um touch on the data
[60:13] a little bit so again data the data came
[60:16] from the uh 2024 Big Data bow has the
[60:20] theme of tackling so we have play
[60:21] tracking data so data collected at uh a
[60:24] rate of 10 measurement per seconds um
[60:27] the NFL put um RFID chips inside of uh
[60:30] the shoulder pads of each player and
[60:32] also the football we have data from the
[60:34] first uh nine weeks of the 2022 NFL
[60:38] regular season and um throughout this
[60:40] talk I will be using an example play uh
[60:43] which is a seven yard run by New York
[60:45] Giants running back St cor Barkley um
[60:47] against the Tennessee Titans from week
[60:49] one of
[60:51] 20122 so the data would look like this
[60:54] if you will actually view it um so you
[60:56] know um we have the time Stam for each
[60:58] play frame ID X and Y so those are just
[61:01] 2D locations of uh the players um then
[61:04] we have speed
[61:06] acceleration distance travel from the
[61:08] previous frame we have the orientation
[61:11] and also the angle motion of the players
[61:13] and one um sort of crucial feature here
[61:18] is the event annotations associated with
[61:21] um each frame um display so we know um
[61:26] when the ball is snapped when the ball
[61:27] is handed up to a running back um when
[61:30] the first Contact is made um and then
[61:32] when his tackle is made and um for U
[61:35] this analysis we will focus on um
[61:37] everything between the ball snap and an
[61:40] end of play event so here we have tackle
[61:41] you can also have like touchdown um out
[61:44] of bound fumble
[61:47] Etc and here's what the um example play
[61:51] um looks like so you know we have saquin
[61:55] barckley when the ball's handed off
[61:57] there are clearly Defenders that
[61:59] contributed to slowing down the running
[62:02] back but was not credited with a tackle
[62:07] previously by the scorekeeper so there
[62:09] are multiple Defenders involved here in
[62:11] this process as you might see so it is
[62:13] necessary to um measure this type of
[62:16] contribution um at a continuous level
[62:19] and so this is the goal of our project
[62:21] so a framework um for within play
[62:26] tackling evaluation consists of the
[62:29] following steps uh the first step is to
[62:32] identify what we call contact windows so
[62:35] these are um sort of time intervals
[62:37] within a play where um the defender has
[62:41] the chance to um possibly make contact
[62:44] with the ball carrier and our definition
[62:46] is that a contact window is a set of
[62:49] consecutive frames where at least one
[62:52] Defender is within one and a half yards
[62:55] the ball carrier
[62:57] and we chose this um one and a half
[62:58] yards threshold since it captures a
[63:02] pretty high proportion um of the
[63:04] distance between the ball carrier and uh
[63:06] the closest Defender at the moments of
[63:08] first Contact and tackles observe ter F
[63:10] Track area as you can see from uh this
[63:13] histogram right here um I will say that
[63:15] this is a very um heris definition um
[63:19] but I think this is the best we can do
[63:21] with the player tracking given we only
[63:22] have the 2D um information of the player
[63:26] um with better information like CL data
[63:29] um data generated from computer vision
[63:31] um you might be able to come up with a
[63:33] better definition of uh contact window
[63:37] but the the other nice thing about this
[63:38] definition is that it can easily be um
[63:41] implemented in a media broadcast um so
[63:44] since this is doesn't require any
[63:45] modeling test here um but again if you
[63:48] have a better definition you can simply
[63:51] plug this into our whole framework and
[63:54] simply replace our definition and
[63:56] hopefully doing a s better job um so um
[64:01] let's go back to uh the example play so
[64:04] um here I'm just plotting it with um um
[64:08] these this animation so on top we have
[64:11] the locations of every players so Giants
[64:15] uh it's in red on offense uh Titans in
[64:19] blue it's on defense and notice that um
[64:22] The Defenders are the colored for each
[64:25] Defender are
[64:26] can change if they are in the contact
[64:29] window of the ball carrier so it changed
[64:31] to Gold here um and so the concept
[64:34] window that was sort of like so if you
[64:35] draw like a circle of radius one and a
[64:37] half yards around the ball carrier then
[64:40] if the Defenders within that threshold
[64:42] then uh we say that they're making
[64:44] contact with the ball carrier and also
[64:47] in the bottom here we have the velocity
[64:50] of the ball here towards the end zone
[64:52] for this play um where again that's y-
[64:56] axis and on a aais just time um and so
[64:59] for this play we observe three separate
[65:02] contact
[65:03] windows and again you can see that um
[65:07] multiple Defenders can be involved um um
[65:11] um in um the contact window and so is
[65:14] necessary to measure this type of
[65:15] contribution and sort of assign
[65:17] appropriate credit um among these
[65:19] Defenders for sewing down the forward
[65:21] motion of the ball
[65:23] carrier well so this brings us to step
[65:26] two which is after we have defined this
[65:29] contact window we want to measure the
[65:32] tackle value of those each of those
[65:35] windows okay so in particular we want to
[65:39] look at the change in
[65:41] velocity relative to where the peak
[65:43] momentum or the peak velocity of the of
[65:46] the ball carrier is Within the play so
[65:48] that triangle right there is for Peak um
[65:50] so it's it's a triangle you know it's
[65:52] peaking um okay so that's first look at
[65:56] the first um contact window okay notice
[66:00] that the peak ball velocity occurs after
[66:04] the window okay as the ball cater
[66:07] continues to um um speed up and gain
[66:11] more velocity towards the end zone after
[66:13] this window so do we say that this
[66:14] window has zero value since the since
[66:17] the ball carrier continues to um gain
[66:20] velocity but but for the second window
[66:23] since the of velocity
[66:27] occurs prior to this window we can take
[66:31] the difference uh in velocity towards
[66:33] the end zone of the ball carrier between
[66:35] the starting and ending time points of
[66:38] this um window and then divide that by
[66:41] the peak M the peak velocity value um um
[66:47] achieved by the ball carrier within this
[66:49] play and this fraction of reduction in
[66:53] velocity relative to the peak veloc
[66:55] values to give us a notion of the value
[66:58] for this um whole concept window I
[67:01] should note that um this is like the the
[67:03] base equation and we had some
[67:05] modifications to this um um B given
[67:09] different sort of trajectories of the U
[67:11] velocity um of the ball carrier but for
[67:15] this specific play we um this
[67:18] calculation can be achieved with this uh
[67:19] simple equation and we can do the same
[67:22] thing for um concept window number three
[67:24] as well but but for um so the same
[67:27] equation but for um illustration purpose
[67:29] um I'm going to move on um and use
[67:31] contact window number two to illustrate
[67:34] our last step which is um dividing the
[67:39] value of the whole contact window into
[67:42] um what we call fractional tackles for
[67:45] um each Defender involved so again so
[67:48] here's contact window two and to give
[67:50] you some context this window spans uh
[67:53] four different frames display so we have
[67:56] those four frames spotted down the
[67:58] bottom
[68:00] um and this window involves two total
[68:04] players um as you can see these uh BTS
[68:08] The these circles in Gold um we have
[68:10] number 37 in the first three frames and
[68:14] number 51s are in the the the latter
[68:17] three frames okay so they they they
[68:19] overlap in the the the two midle frames
[68:22] here okay so again step two we have the
[68:27] the contact window value
[68:29] already the first step here is to divide
[68:32] that window value equally across all
[68:35] frames we in the window okay so each
[68:37] frame would receive a quarter of the
[68:39] credit here and then within each frame
[68:42] we equally divide the the frame level
[68:46] value across uh the the the players
[68:50] involved in that frame based on how many
[68:52] players there are so for the first frame
[68:53] it's only 37 so that
[68:56] um so 37 would get all the credit for
[68:57] this Frame second and third frame uh 37
[69:01] 51 so they each get half of the credit
[69:03] for uh the the frame frame level credit
[69:06] and then for the last frame 51 is the
[69:08] only only player in the contact window
[69:10] and so they get um all credit for that
[69:14] frame okay and then for then we can sort
[69:17] of aggregate across um the window level
[69:20] by adding the frame level credit for
[69:22] each player to get their specific um
[69:25] window level tackle value and then you
[69:26] can Agate across across uh the whole
[69:29] play um uh the game the season
[69:33] Etc okay so so here's the uh the summary
[69:36] of our fractural tackles metric um for
[69:39] the example play of uh the SE brck play
[69:42] I shown earlier um so previously if you
[69:45] just look at the box score um statistics
[69:49] um only three players had um sort of
[69:53] like these labels so the
[69:56] one person got a tackle Credit One got
[69:58] credit with an assist and one got a Miss
[70:00] tackle but here we are able to credit
[70:04] four additional Defenders for um sort of
[70:08] contributing to slowing down the um the
[70:10] ball carrier so and which effectively
[70:13] down weights the uh the contribution of
[70:17] um the the people that previously got um
[70:20] attack when
[70:22] assist okay so so far I've presented our
[70:25] framework and so what I'm going to do
[70:28] now is to present um a few um sort of
[70:31] validation tests to what we just
[70:34] proposed so first we have uh the
[70:36] leaderboard of
[70:39] uh of fractional tackles for all players
[70:42] uh so the The Columns here are the what
[70:45] what we're going to focus on here are
[70:47] the the last two columns so first we
[70:49] have total fractional tackles and then
[70:51] average fractional tackles so we we just
[70:53] look at total fractional tackles goals
[70:56] we see that linebackers are those that
[71:00] um have sort of the highest amount of to
[71:03] fractional tackles um so you see names
[71:06] like ran Smith for luon ETC these are
[71:10] names that also U Finish pretty high in
[71:13] the actual tackle reader board in real
[71:16] life in 2022 but if you just look at the
[71:19] average fractional tackles we see that
[71:21] defensive lineman so defensive tackles
[71:24] uh defensive Etc they they actually have
[71:28] higher fractional tackles value on
[71:31] average um than the linebacker so
[71:34] although the linebackers accumulate
[71:37] tackles um a metric captures how the
[71:40] defensive lineman um sort of tend to
[71:44] record more consistent stops on the ball
[71:46] carrier and hence this metric sort of
[71:48] provides a more measurable statistics
[71:50] for defensive lineman which uh the a
[71:53] position that um sort of been lack in
[71:56] sufficient um objective measures
[72:01] previously next up we have um let me try
[72:03] to hide this
[72:06] oops I hide
[72:11] this oh there we go all right so we have
[72:14] this scatter plot here so what are these
[72:18] uh axes and data point so on on the y-
[72:20] axis we have the total fractional
[72:22] players for these Defenders um which are
[72:25] the the the Dots here and on that should
[72:29] be the y- axis on the x-axis we have the
[72:31] total tackles and assist over two for
[72:33] these Defenders as well and again each
[72:35] these data points are the players
[72:36] calculated by their position group and
[72:39] the dash line here is the identity line
[72:41] which means that if the total fractional
[72:43] tackles for a player exactly equals the
[72:46] total tackles and assists data point
[72:49] corresponding to that player would fall
[72:51] on the dash
[72:52] line so what we can see here is that
[72:55] despite the strong correlation total
[72:58] fractional tackles are lower than the
[73:01] total tackles in assist since most of
[73:03] these data points sort of lie below the
[73:06] dash line um so this suggests that the
[73:08] traditional stats of tackles in ass say
[73:10] sort of overstate contribution of um a
[73:14] defender in terms of halting the forward
[73:17] motion of the ball
[73:20] carrier the the the last thing that we
[73:24] have here is some stability plot so
[73:27] question of Interest here is does a
[73:29] metric measure the same quantity over
[73:31] time so in other words um this um
[73:35] previous performance
[73:37] predictive uh of uh future performance
[73:40] according to our metric so in the top
[73:43] row here we have um on the y axis total
[73:48] fractional tackles for the last five
[73:51] weeks of the 2020 our data um and then
[73:55] on the x-axis the first four weeks um
[73:58] and then the first part is just the
[73:59] overall correlation among um these
[74:01] players and then we also separated um
[74:04] this plot um by position so the lad
[74:06] three plots are the within position um
[74:10] correlations um and then for the of
[74:13] comparisons we also show the um to Total
[74:16] tackle and assis um um the the exact
[74:20] same with the exact same plots in the
[74:22] bottom row and overall the trend here is
[74:25] that we see that um first of all
[74:27] fractional tackles is repeatable among
[74:29] these Defenders as reflected by this
[74:32] sort of moderately strong correlation of
[74:35] 69 in the top left um plot we we we also
[74:40] see that overall and also within
[74:41] correlation a metric um is more
[74:44] predictive of future performance
[74:46] compared to um uh tackles and assists
[74:49] across the board um we just compare
[74:51] these correlation values um a metric
[74:55] um um all um had um higher values and
[74:59] hence uh it has a higher um prict
[75:01] performance of
[75:03] um um then um tackles and
[75:07] assist okay so uh so want to quickly
[75:11] wrap up with some discussion so in this
[75:14] project we have introduced uh fractional
[75:17] tackles which is a new simple continuous
[75:19] metric for defensive performance one key
[75:22] stat that we uh we found s fascinating
[75:24] is that players that made a tackle um
[75:27] based on just the the play level data do
[75:30] not have the highest fractional tackle
[75:33] in more than 20% of the place in this
[75:36] sort of N9 we sample um so which is uh
[75:40] kind of interesting and one limitation
[75:42] that as I sort of touched on earlier is
[75:44] we only have the 2D tracking data so we
[75:47] don't know whether or not the players
[75:48] are actually making contact with one
[75:51] another but um if we have access to
[75:55] better data like post data Compu V
[75:59] Vision data Etc we might be able to
[76:03] um um get a better sense of um this
[76:06] whole making contact and maybe come up
[76:09] with a better definition of the contact
[76:12] Windows fut Direction so if you happen
[76:16] to check out our big derable submission
[76:20] the title of the submission is momentum
[76:21] based fractional tackles but notice when
[76:24] this uh talk the ttle is only fractional
[76:26] tackle so we dropped the momentum stuff
[76:29] but so to sort of talk about future
[76:33] directions here's a a picture of uh two
[76:36] running backs that play for the Tennesse
[76:38] Titans back in I think 2018 so on the
[76:41] left we have Dion Lewis who is only 195
[76:44] pounds on the right we have Derk Henry
[76:46] who is
[76:48] 245 is pounds so what what what I want
[76:51] to emphasize here is that size does
[76:53] matter here because you know tackling
[76:55] someone like Deion Lewis is not the same
[76:57] as tackling Derek Henry and so momentum
[77:01] is actually a better measure of forward
[77:03] progress than just velocity towards the
[77:05] end zone since the concept momentum is
[77:08] essentially mass in motion where it's
[77:10] the product of um the players's weight
[77:13] times the velocity um but I want to note
[77:16] that in a framework of uh creating
[77:19] fractional tackles replacing velocity
[77:22] with momentum with resul in the same
[77:24] answer was just you know having one
[77:27] quantity on top and we're dividing by
[77:29] that quantity so the mass of the player
[77:30] would get cancelled so um someone
[77:33] pointed out to to us at Big dat bowl and
[77:35] we were like yes that's correct mean we
[77:38] should think about simple math in the
[77:40] first place but we do think there's lots
[77:42] of interesting um applications we can do
[77:45] with momentum um we have a project going
[77:47] on right now looking at the change in
[77:49] momentum um um for the contact window
[77:52] and sort of trying to um
[77:55] um look at different factors that impact
[77:58] that and so on so um stay tuned for that
[78:02] I guess so I want to quickly uh
[78:05] acknowledge uh a few people we have a a
[78:08] full team from CMU uh Larry Jang uh M
[78:12] Ellingwood and uh Ron Yoko someone on
[78:14] Twitter gave Ron a nickname I think the
[78:16] Nick Sabin of football analytics
[78:18] something like that which U I guess
[78:20] appropriate because um but I want to
[78:22] acknowledge them for uh the uh this
[78:25] whole the whole involvement in this
[78:28] project guess thanks to Greg for early
[78:31] conversation at work in uh Chicago when
[78:34] I was visiting uh before uh I think it
[78:37] was during Thanksgiving last year and S
[78:40] of got a few ideas out of that also want
[78:43] to acknowledge uh the big dat organizers
[78:46] uh the uh data analytics team from the
[78:49] NFL so
[78:50] Mike um Ali Blake Tom Bliss and the rest
[78:54] of the crew for yet another year of sort
[78:56] of fantastic um competition great lots
[79:00] of great submissions this year and I
[79:02] would encourage everyone to um you know
[79:05] participate in the Big D Bowl in uh
[79:07] future competitions it's a great way to
[79:09] be involved um not just in sports
[79:11] analytics but to Showcase your data
[79:14] science skill in general um that would
[79:16] be a amazing thing to put on your um
[79:19] portfolio
[79:21] um um so going to close out with with
[79:24] some links so we have a paper release on
[79:27] archive I think I put it up there two
[79:29] weeks ago three weeks ago maybe um it's
[79:32] under review um check out our notebook
[79:34] uh big d bow this year all the code are
[79:38] proba available on on GitHub um you want
[79:41] to contact me that's my website uh free
[79:43] to reach out if you have any questions
[79:45] and if you interested in sports
[79:47] analytics which I think most of you are
[79:49] as soon as you're here check out what
[79:50] CMU has to offer um we have our conf
[79:54] annual confence every November um and
[79:59] lots of other uh fun initiatives so
[80:02] that's all I have and thank you for your
[80:10] attention so we got a
[80:18] question uh I have three question
[80:20] actually uh so the first one is like um
[80:23] when you draw the circle C is where
[80:25] wrong do you need to consider some
[80:27] directionality when you attribute the
[80:28] value for example if a defenseman is
[80:31] behind the person maybe not but like
[80:34] probably you don't want to for now no
[80:36] but I guess we could but take that into
[80:39] account that it's possible so again like
[80:41] I mentioned earlier uh a definition is
[80:43] very very simple it's just like distance
[80:45] based but you can come up with like a
[80:47] better definition using like you said
[80:49] Direction angle Etc um okay plug that in
[80:53] and R phase you know what we have had
[80:54] and then try to see if the results would
[80:56] change I doubt it would change that much
[80:59] but I don't know I haven't done that
[81:01] sort of s sensitivity analysis okay
[81:03] because um like you're u in your study
[81:06] you're trying to count it as the
[81:08] fraction of the mo like a velocity drop
[81:10] forward velocity drop right yes towards
[81:12] the end zone yeah so I'm just that
[81:15] consider that already consider Direction
[81:17] so I'm just thinking about like when you
[81:19] consider how you say the value
[81:21] distribution should also like for people
[81:24] who behind you don't distribute any
[81:25] value to the person because they're
[81:27] behind they're not stopping the so
[81:29] that's that's first thing that that's a
[81:30] good point yeah okay second thing is
[81:32] about um so if it's a velocity drop
[81:35] right and then does it mean that people
[81:38] outside that Circle doesn't contribute
[81:41] anything for example if there are people
[81:42] already in in front of but they're
[81:44] outside of Zone would they still
[81:46] contribute to the velocity drop no but
[81:50] for now no for now if if they're outside
[81:53] we're not assigning any value to them
[81:55] but um but logically does it like sorry
[81:58] yeah I mean that that that makes sense
[81:59] and I mean we could
[82:02] like try again try different definitions
[82:05] of um the contact window um but okay I
[82:09] think would if we get like 3D positional
[82:13] data like post data that that would be
[82:15] the ultimate goal of making this more
[82:19] like appropriate yeah thank you and then
[82:21] third question is like uh I think you
[82:23] you study the correlation between the
[82:25] fractional tackle and then the com
[82:28] traditional concept of combined tackle
[82:30] which is tackle plus half of the Cy and
[82:33] then you saw there are correlation but
[82:36] um I mean that's that's really good but
[82:39] then the question would be for for
[82:41] example if a Coach or a manager they
[82:44] look at the leaderboard there are two
[82:45] they're facing two leaderboard one
[82:47] leaderboard is the fractional tackle
[82:48] leaderboard another is the sorry the
[82:52] combined traditional yeah yeah then
[82:54] which one should trust more I mean
[82:56] logically fractional tackle May is
[82:59] better because it's continuous but still
[83:01] like is there any evidence or support to
[83:04] say hey you can you should consider this
[83:06] better more than the other one yeah
[83:08] because I think a metric is not just a
[83:11] binary definition we're we're defining
[83:14] it based on like the actual definition
[83:16] of tackling right which is
[83:19] stopping the for motion of the ball car
[83:23] that's what we use to derive the metric
[83:25] um so that that that's I guess that's
[83:28] the pitch to um the coaches out there
[83:31] and so if if there's a good example of
[83:33] showing that what TR combined
[83:36] leaderboard failed to capture but
[83:38] successfully captured in the fraction
[83:40] tle I think that would be very helpful
[83:42] right yeah Pro that is yeah I
[83:45] um I don't think we looked at any
[83:49] example I don't know but that's a good
[83:52] point it's it's a thank should
[83:54] definitely look into that yeah but thank
[83:56] you that's a good
[83:59] point one quick question then my my
[84:02] actual question Wong did you use Greg's
[84:05] ideas or did you just do the
[84:07] opposite um that was not really his idea
[84:11] was it I don't know I mean s talked and
[84:13] then I mean our group also has that idea
[84:15] already but you know where was like Hey
[84:18] velocity towards whatever and yeah and
[84:21] then um we we sort of it toward that
[84:25] specific thing and keyword pivot yeah
[84:27] yeah so uh my my question on the uh are
[84:31] there any like um forward momentum plays
[84:35] where it would be
[84:36] multimodal um so a player gets their
[84:39] Peak speed loses speed and then regains
[84:41] speed and how does how do those come out
[84:44] so for for for our framework currently
[84:46] so you're seeing there are two peaks um
[84:49] what I think the right thing to do is
[84:51] actually splitting that play into sort
[84:54] of multiple plays so so that we can say
[84:56] that this running back has sort of
[84:58] multiple lives instead of just one life
[85:00] um just the idea of like Angry runs
[85:02] where it's just you know running and
[85:04] just running angrier you have a peak and
[85:06] then you're peeking even higher but for
[85:08] now say you have small Peak and then a
[85:10] bigger Peak which is ignoring totally
[85:12] what happened previously to the to the
[85:14] that big peak but that's
[85:16] certainly um what we didn't do but do
[85:20] you know how often though there is
[85:22] multimodal curves like like I don't know
[85:25] the answer but we have def we definitely
[85:28] found like bunch of not a bunch of but
[85:32] several nonzero nonzero yes right who
[85:35] wants to go just want to pass it
[85:37] down um so when you were doing the
[85:40] stability analysis did you consider
[85:42] doing it like on a perap basis because
[85:45] like I feel like there's kind of a
[85:46] confounding variable where if you're
[85:47] like an insign linebacker for the first
[85:50] um how many total games was it like the
[85:52] first eight you compared the first weeks
[85:54] um and I should mentioned that we only
[85:55] consider running back Run play so we're
[85:57] not considering catch plays or
[85:59] quarterback Sam scrambles but just all
[86:01] running back right so you compared like
[86:03] the first eight weeks to the last nine
[86:04] weeks or something right no first four
[86:06] versus last five okay yeah first four
[86:08] versus last five like isn't there
[86:09] confounding variable of just like if
[86:11] you're an inside linebacker like you're
[86:12] going to play more snaps in the first
[86:14] four weeks and you're going to play more
[86:15] snaps in like the SEC the weeks you know
[86:18] five through nine or five through 10 or
[86:20] whatever five yeah five through nine
[86:22] anyway um so I think we did look into
[86:26] first snap I think I looked into that
[86:29] specifically um just like first
[86:32] stability like I feel like give you I
[86:34] get I get where you're coming from yes
[86:36] that that's probably should also include
[86:39] that in like the revision of the paper
[86:41] or something like that but yeah right
[86:42] and then one more so you said you were
[86:44] talking about more like momentum studies
[86:45] you were doing have you looked into like
[86:47] tush push stuff at all and like how much
[86:49] like the guy behind him weighs versus
[86:51] like he's pushing the not that specific
[86:54] speically um because one other thing
[86:57] about the big der issue is that the NFL
[86:59] doesn't want us to do any sort of injury
[87:01] analysis and then tush push has lots of
[87:04] like implications to injury so oh okay
[87:07] um but I don't think the samples for
[87:10] tush p is that high right that makes
[87:13] sense yeah I guess we need a couple
[87:14] years of like Jaylen Herz but
[87:18] yeah uh so when I was looking at um how
[87:22] you were comparing the fractional tack
[87:24] across like different position groups I
[87:26] noticed that you uh grouped both
[87:28] cornerbacks and safeties into defensive
[87:30] backs and usually when you look at like
[87:32] the stat sheet for traditional tackles
[87:34] you see first like in terms of like
[87:36] positional groups there's the
[87:37] linebackers and then there's the
[87:38] safeties and safeties normally have a
[87:40] lot more like tackles and solo tackles
[87:42] than um quarterbacks I was wondering if
[87:44] you um a looked at the difference in
[87:47] fractional tackles between cornerbacks
[87:49] and safeties and B if that match similar
[87:51] trends for tackles and solo tackles no
[87:53] but that's good point I should
[87:55] definitely do that uh at some point but
[87:57] yes your point is well taken yeah thank
[88:06] you yeah I mean about five more minutes
[88:08] until the next session so just keep
[88:11] going okay so I noticed I notic in your
[88:14] fractional like tackle metric you you
[88:17] don't care really much about the time
[88:19] window it takes to complete the tackle
[88:22] um I was wondering if like because for a
[88:25] certain velocity change if the The
[88:28] Tackle window takes longer the um
[88:30] offensive uh person carrying the ball
[88:33] will advance further over that time
[88:35] period is there any way of waiting to
[88:37] fractional tackles that take less time
[88:39] to complete have you thought about that
[88:41] that's a good point I think we we
[88:43] briefly thought about the idea of
[88:45] weighted fractional tackles but um no
[88:49] but we didn't do it um again it's
[88:53] supposedly but I mean all the code are
[88:55] there so if you want to improve upon
[88:57] this feel free to you know go hard
