[00:01] all right we're gonna go ahead and get
[00:02] started with the panel discussion um hi
[00:06] everyone Brian McDonald uh you might
[00:08] have seen me introduce myself earlier
[00:10] today but um I'm uh I'm currently uh at
[00:14] Yale um and with me on the panel here uh
[00:19] we have Emily Wright from volleyball
[00:22] Canada uh Paul Sabin from University of
[00:26] Pennsylvania um Sean ahed from the
[00:30] Pittsburgh Pirates and New Haven
[00:33] Connecticut um Sean fiser from
[00:36] Cincinnati Reds so we got uh you know
[00:40] what is that uh one two onethird of the
[00:44] panel is Sha's I don't know I don't know
[00:47] why I should have just moved on um yeah
[00:51] so
[00:52] ccin and then we have Luke Ben uh at
[00:56] Harvard and so I'm not going to read
[00:59] their full bios they because the first
[01:00] question is basically uh sort of about
[01:02] this about their backgrounds and stuff
[01:04] so I just kind of wanted to start this
[01:06] panel uh is uh
[01:08] basically uh about different careers in
[01:11] sports and also different paths to uh
[01:14] either a career in sports or working on
[01:16] Sports analytics in some way if it's not
[01:18] the main career um we good with audio
[01:22] video
[01:30] okay all right I can scooch
[01:33] over um so I guess uh like I I kind of
[01:37] just wanted to start um just by hearing
[01:40] a little bit about um the career Paths
[01:44] of everyone um including
[01:48] like what kinds of stuff did you like to
[01:50] do in high school and college or junior
[01:54] high or before you even knew analytics
[01:56] Sports analytics was actually a thing
[01:58] what kinds of stuff did you like to do
[02:01] um did that inform what you studied in
[02:04] college uh and and so on so um yeah what
[02:08] what what were your passions I guess
[02:10] growing up as a as a
[02:14] kid no no order we're not going down the
[02:17] line I'm gonna I'll say that now we're
[02:20] not going down the line just you just
[02:23] said we're not going down I'll go fine
[02:25] all right um I I love sports grown up
[02:28] but as I mean as you can tell I was very
[02:31] muscular as a kid as well so um always
[02:35] always tall and skinny and so in a
[02:37] certain point in high school uh you know
[02:39] being a three-point shooter but getting
[02:40] knocked around in football you know had
[02:43] its limits and I I knew knew that I
[02:46] wasn't going to play Collegiate or
[02:47] anything in sports and so I you know I
[02:49] was I was good to math and always
[02:51] enjoyed that but I remember taking
[02:52] calculus in high school and I was like
[02:53] this is math isn't as fun um as like the
[02:56] other math uh where you like you know
[02:59] actually do stuff that like is real
[03:01] world problems in other math classes
[03:03] they would give you like world word
[03:04] problems right and so I realized oh I
[03:06] like I like applied stuff people always
[03:08] told me that I should do engineering
[03:10] because you know my mom was like it's
[03:11] four years then you get a good job and
[03:13] it's like an applied math and then I
[03:15] went to an engineering class I left
[03:16] Midway through the first day and signed
[03:19] up to do statistics so um you know I
[03:23] always always have just LED love sports
[03:26] I always as a kid always would pay
[03:28] attention like the box score stuff which
[03:30] you know is ironic because now we rail
[03:32] against box scores for a living but um
[03:36] anyways that that's sort of my path I
[03:38] studi statistics and whenever I had a a
[03:41] problem or like an opportunity to pick a
[03:43] project uh in a class to apply method
[03:46] that we were learning I you know instead
[03:48] of doing probably more useful work like
[03:50] studying you know cancer or other actual
[03:53] helpful things in the world I I enjoyed
[03:55] Sports so I always picked a sports
[03:57] problem instead
[04:03] um my story is pretty similar to Paul's
[04:06] in that there was definitely a point
[04:08] where I realized not going to be playing
[04:11] baseball football
[04:12] basketball I'm G to run uh that's my
[04:15] skill I so I ran in high school I ran in
[04:19] college um and that was like what I did
[04:22] to engage with sports mostly um I grew
[04:25] up a fan of the big New England teams um
[04:29] you know and followed them but
[04:31] but math was never my my favorite
[04:34] subject in school somewhat ironically
[04:36] now um but when I got to college I
[04:40] wanted to study literature signed up for
[04:43] that major and somebody was like you
[04:45] know sort of similar you might want a
[04:48] job that pays you some money and um
[04:51] they're like why don't you you know they
[04:53] were like you're not bad at math just go
[04:56] it's different than High School like go
[04:57] do that and so I double maj in
[05:00] literature and math and then went to
[05:03] grad school in a completely unrelated
[05:05] field um but that let me get a lot more
[05:08] exposure to statistics uh Hands-On and
[05:11] gave me the opportunity to do research
[05:13] and projects and some of which I
[05:15] eventually just started being moving
[05:17] into that like I'm going to do them
[05:18] about sports I'm going to do them about
[05:20] sports away from the social sciency part
[05:22] of it and
[05:24] um eventually that became independent
[05:26] projects the independent projects turned
[05:28] into job applications
[05:30] enough job applications turned into a
[05:33] job which is you know the
[05:36] goal I'm I'm happy to go next I don't
[05:39] think my story is all that much
[05:42] different I think um I very quickly
[05:45] around the 8th or ninth grade saw three
[05:48] curveballs and realized that I wasn't
[05:50] going to you know make the major leagues
[05:52] or anything like that and um I guess
[05:55] like I sort of had a similar experience
[05:58] where I saw proofs for the first time um
[06:02] in college and I said this math which
[06:05] you know I had liked a lot in high
[06:06] school all of a sudden seems like a
[06:09] waste of time you know you it seems like
[06:11] you do something and it lives on a
[06:13] Blackboard and like who really cares
[06:16] about this stuff and if you do that like
[06:20] all the more power to you it's you know
[06:22] hard and I'm sure that it's important in
[06:25] some context that I'm yet to figure
[06:27] out um but i instead sort of learned
[06:31] like statistics is this toolbox that you
[06:34] can apply towards problems in any area
[06:37] that you're interested in so for me
[06:40] Sports has been one of those things and
[06:42] kind of medicine and public health has
[06:44] been another but I think that that's um
[06:48] my favorite part about you know
[06:49] statistics and data science more
[06:51] generally it's really hard to ever get
[06:52] bored because if you get bored of the
[06:54] problem that you're working on the
[06:56] skills are so transferable you can just
[06:58] work on a different problem and you know
[07:00] thankfully I I'm yet to get bored by
[07:03] working on problems in sports but um you
[07:06] know that's sort of my my path
[07:08] there I can dovetail some somewhat off
[07:12] that um I well to to start from how I
[07:16] first got interested I always wanted to
[07:18] work in baseball I remember the day when
[07:20] I was 5 years old when I fell in love
[07:22] with baseball going to a game at Tiger
[07:24] Stadium uh for a friend's birthday and
[07:26] was obsessed with it ever since not at
[07:28] all from an analytical end it predated
[07:31] Moneyball by some 15 years or at least
[07:33] when Moneyball was set um and I um went
[07:38] to to school um at the University of
[07:41] Chicago I got an economics and a Latin
[07:43] American studies uh minor was the latter
[07:47] and I called that my baseball major and
[07:49] I just did a lot of things in a lot of
[07:51] different ways writing about baseball
[07:53] working with the baseball team um and
[07:55] just otherwise learning and and taking
[07:57] stuff I was interested in and and my
[08:00] first path into the game was actually
[08:02] writing about baseball working in-house
[08:04] Publications with the Chicago Cubs and
[08:06] it wasn't until about six years after
[08:09] that that I was directly using let's say
[08:12] the quantitative economics part um so
[08:15] I've always known I wanted to work in
[08:16] baseball and always taken steps towards
[08:19] doing that and it wasn't until kind of
[08:22] later that uh a lot of the pieces came
[08:27] together I wasn't planning oh can you
[08:30] hear me can you hear me okay um so as if
[08:34] it wasn't obvious and if you haven't
[08:36] heard me say it a hundred times I am
[08:38] Canadian I grew up on the east coast of
[08:40] Canada in a really small town um and if
[08:43] you've ever grown up in a small town you
[08:44] know that there's absolutely nothing to
[08:46] do um so I basically played every sport
[08:49] Under the Sun and I was also kind of um
[08:52] there's different terms for it whether
[08:53] it's boy daughter or your Father's son
[08:56] um I was the son of the family so I kind
[08:59] of like did all the sports my father
[09:01] played we watched Sports together y y y
[09:03] so um that's how I got into sports
[09:05] growing up um I went on and played
[09:08] provincially and then I went and played
[09:10] um volleyball in University I studied
[09:13] pure math when I was in university um
[09:16] kind of coincided with like covid
[09:18] happening retirements injuries and I
[09:21] actually kind of took I guess a
[09:23] different turn than most where I hated
[09:24] Sports I didn't want to touch them I
[09:26] didn't want to go anywhere near them for
[09:27] like three or four years and I went and
[09:30] did my Master's in Montreal and I took a
[09:32] sports analytics course and it was kind
[09:34] of finally that like okay like I like
[09:37] sports again but it was also my first
[09:39] official mix of like oh there's a sport
[09:42] side and there's like a math side um to
[09:44] my life and I can kind of join them if I
[09:47] so choose um so yeah that answer the
[09:50] question
[09:51] right good answer good answer um yeah I
[09:56] mean so some of you touched on this
[09:58] already um um but like just curious um
[10:02] so you know some different paths
[10:05] although everyone was interested in
[10:07] sports I guess as a young at a young age
[10:09] not surprisingly was expecting that
[10:12] answer um but lots of different paths
[10:16] and also you're what you're doing now is
[10:18] different for a lot of people so we have
[10:20] people that are in Academia people are
[10:21] in the sports industry some people work
[10:23] for teams some who don't work for teams
[10:26] um some who used to work in media um
[10:30] and um so lots of different choices
[10:33] there so curious uh you know of the
[10:36] things that you sort of just talked
[10:38] about as far as like your your passions
[10:41] um and and so forth growing up what made
[10:44] you choose to go into sports or stay in
[10:48] Academia or go sports to Academia or
[10:50] back and forth bunch of times um that
[10:54] that's me I guess not you but you went
[10:57] back and forth once I guess
[11:00] um and you know work for a team versus
[11:03] not for a team um so on just so yeah
[11:07] just talk about what sort of made you
[11:10] choose your your current what your the
[11:13] job that you're currently
[11:17] in no can't go in the same order
[11:20] Paul
[11:23] um uh so I went to grad school for
[11:28] communication I have a doctorate
[11:30] effectively in political communication I
[11:31] started that in August of 2016 which if
[11:35] you're um versed in recent American
[11:37] history was a hell of a time to be like
[11:39] yeah let me study us political
[11:42] partisanship especially in online media
[11:45] it was
[11:47] like it was a tough few years uh people
[11:50] weren't that happy um but it was really
[11:53] I mean it was interesting it was
[11:54] informative like it was a great
[11:55] experience but it was challenging right
[11:57] like there are topics in a lot of the
[12:00] I'm speaking from a social science
[12:02] fields that can be really rewarding you
[12:06] can do a lot of it work but make very
[12:08] little impact and I actually when I
[12:12] finished up grad school my first job out
[12:14] was with a federal contractor doing
[12:16] evaluation work um on the federal
[12:21] government's covid vaccination Public
[12:23] Health Campaign which again a little bit
[12:26] different very impactful but like 10
[12:28] times is depressing and so hit a point
[12:32] where I was like I can't keep doing this
[12:34] I do love sports like the goal is always
[12:35] sort of to be in sports um and the
[12:38] sports sort of became this opportunity
[12:40] to be like the parts I like of my job
[12:42] the things I've done over the last five
[12:44] years were data um analysis research
[12:48] communication Sports was the way to do
[12:50] that without it being how do you click
[12:52] on this ad how do you study political
[12:55] partisanship in the United States at a
[12:57] time when it is not good or covid at the
[13:00] time um and then we went 62 in 100 the
[13:05] first season so Rocky first year but we
[13:08] we we rebounded and now it's much more
[13:11] fun um just a quick followup question so
[13:15] you said you studied political
[13:16] Communication in particular yes sir what
[13:21] um what from that I can imagine that
[13:23] would potentially be useful is there
[13:25] anything in particular that um you
[13:27] really use a lot now that you're doing
[13:29] sports analytics and need to communicate
[13:31] with people at your team um because
[13:34] there's sort of not exactly political
[13:36] parties within an organization but there
[13:38] are sometimes different camps no it's a
[13:41] good question um luckily people usually
[13:44] don't fracture quite so extremely
[13:48] um I will I uh the nice part about grad
[13:53] school and communication is you actually
[13:54] study very little about how to
[13:55] communicate so in terms of like this is
[13:59] a good strategy this isn't a good
[14:00] strategy um but so there's a lot of
[14:03] methodological you know you're doing all
[14:05] this stuff that you bring to your job
[14:07] from the stat side but I do think the
[14:09] like takeaways of just like it does help
[14:12] you set some perspective setting to come
[14:14] in and be
[14:15] like we're not arguing about whatever
[14:19] the political issue of the moment is um
[14:23] you know we're arguing
[14:25] over how often should we have Ellie
[14:28] daily Cruz try to steal B you know I
[14:29] mean you you come with some perspective
[14:31] of just like is this the hill I want to
[14:33] die on or is this thing where I can step
[14:35] back sort of go yep I hear you let me
[14:40] like not get I wouldn't say not too
[14:43] invested but not too maybe
[14:46] emotionally uh defensive of everything
[14:49] because you're like nope I've
[14:51] seen that side of it and like this is a
[14:54] thing that is supposed to be hard but
[14:56] fun
[15:01] um to the the question about choosing
[15:04] you know industry or team or not um I
[15:08] think it's always been pretty obvious to
[15:09] me that I want to work for a team uh and
[15:12] it's only become increasingly so uh
[15:15] though I will say that there are a lot
[15:18] more interesting paths in sports either
[15:21] Academia or uh interesting companies
[15:24] like Paul's work for Su um Sports to
[15:28] there's so many options now which is
[15:29] great whatever your path is for me uh a
[15:32] few things one I I realized I really
[15:35] like impacting a team um seeing uh a
[15:39] project directly to the stakeholder uh
[15:42] communicating with those stakeholders
[15:43] trying to anticipate their needs and and
[15:45] seeing the impact on the field and when
[15:48] you win it only becomes increasingly uh
[15:51] I don't know intoxicating and exciting
[15:54] to to be part of that and even now as I
[15:57] think about you know I went previously I
[16:00] was with the Chicago Cubs for six years
[16:02] in R&D and now at the Pirates it was
[16:04] really to me about wanting uh for my
[16:08] second team to to go through a build uh
[16:11] and and it's most fun when it manifests
[16:14] in winning it wouldn't be worth it
[16:16] otherwise but uh I enjoyed that build I
[16:19] enjoy when you do win looking around at
[16:22] your teammates that people have done
[16:23] along with you and thinking we did this
[16:26] together and and and sometimes you know
[16:28] with that kind of naive optimism that
[16:30] you can so for me it's always been
[16:32] pretty obvious uh that a team is my path
[16:36] and uh maybe I'm interested about others
[16:39] uh because there's a lot of other
[16:40] interesting more interesting ways than
[16:42] there used to be now feel like I've done
[16:45] everything that you haven't
[16:47] done which is i' I've worked for ESPN
[16:50] for seven years um so I'm local here to
[16:53] Connecticut from that time and um so a
[16:56] Media Sports media company I know I had
[16:58] a really annoying boss for about a year
[17:00] and a half 2019 to 2020 um just kidding
[17:05] um and uh and worked for Sumer Sports
[17:09] which is like a third party company that
[17:10] worked you know we worked directly with
[17:12] NFL teams and you know I back in
[17:15] Academia so you know for me My Life
[17:19] Choices have always kind of been one the
[17:21] job at ESPN it was a dream like I told
[17:24] you know I tell people like as a kid I
[17:26] watch sports center every day not I know
[17:29] kids don't do that anymore right media
[17:31] has changed you can like look up who won
[17:33] the game on your phone which why would
[17:35] you want to watch an hour of TV just to
[17:37] figure out who won a game but that's how
[17:39] it used to be and um so you know it was
[17:43] a dream like working at ESPN seeing the
[17:45] work that I did show up on TV had its
[17:47] downsides like you know being at dinner
[17:50] and realizing that like something in my
[17:52] model spit out doesn't look right and
[17:54] seeing it on the TV behind behind me you
[17:57] know at the bar at the restaurant you
[17:59] know so there's downsides as well but
[18:01] I've always kind of for me try to
[18:02] prioritize like sports jobs with work
[18:05] like balance and although I haven't
[18:07] worked for a team from the many
[18:09] conversations I've had with people that
[18:10] do that's sometimes harder to have you
[18:13] know stable nine to- five for a team
[18:15] because teams don't play in between 9
[18:17] and five during the day usually unless
[18:19] it's baseball and it's like twice a week
[18:21] they do that but um so you know that's
[18:24] what's kind of led me to different
[18:26] things here but you know I'm I'm the
[18:27] type of person always likes to stay
[18:29] intellectually curious and so you know
[18:31] I've been fortunate to have things have
[18:33] challenged me every step of the way and
[18:35] I would always encourage people to you
[18:37] know not get complacent and always be
[18:39] learning you know no matter what you
[18:41] do so Sean and Shan work life balance
[18:45] any
[18:47] thoughts it it is uh better than it used
[18:51] to be in my observation it's definitely
[18:53] I I'm sure compared to a lot of other
[18:55] jobs and industries uh not the same uh
[18:59] when I was in my time with the Cubs I
[19:01] was probably in the office 330 out of
[19:04] 365 days and I told that to a friend's C
[19:07] co-worker spouse at one point she
[19:08] thought I was crazy until I listed off
[19:10] well there's Thanksgiving there's uh all
[19:13] these other you know holidays or
[19:15] something like that because she thought
[19:16] I was like too low in my estimate so um
[19:20] there work life balance was uh really
[19:24] bad uh in a lot of ways I you know I
[19:27] didn't actually always mind it myself I
[19:29] was all in on on what it was but it
[19:32] obviously has a ton of downsides is
[19:34] exclusionary in a lot of ways and and
[19:36] probably longterm not great now one of
[19:38] the advantage there's uh at least in
[19:42] baseball the the Relentless pace of the
[19:44] schedule has not changed and the fact
[19:46] that there's um different baseball
[19:49] Milestones draft season offseason trade
[19:52] deadline all that are constantly ongoing
[19:54] so you can't escape kind of the yearr
[19:56] round part of it within baseball
[19:59] but as our teams have grown there's more
[20:01] redundancy um there's more opportunity
[20:04] for people to especially in like
[20:06] research and development to um kind of
[20:09] Sprint when inspired and then step back
[20:11] at other times or kind of um you know
[20:14] take secondary roles on things work more
[20:16] on specific projects as opposed to
[20:18] everything so I think this has gotten a
[20:20] lot better um I've had in the last month
[20:23] uh a couple people take one to two week
[20:26] trips and that's as a season start
[20:28] stting and stuff like that and it hasn't
[20:30] brought down the team and and most
[20:33] people really kind of embrace and
[20:34] cherish that all the way up to R GM so
[20:36] all improving um fact it seems like it
[20:38] made the team better yeah that's right
[20:41] that's right don't want to know what
[20:43] happens when I
[20:46] exactly um I don't have quite the same
[20:49] overtime sense but I agree with what
[20:52] you're saying about currently most teams
[20:55] have larger and larger investments in
[20:57] analytics are
[20:59] the more people you have the easier it
[21:01] is to to take time off and step away and
[21:05] and um feel like the world isn't going
[21:07] to fall while you're not there because
[21:09] your teammates will help pick you up and
[21:11] support you um and I think that's a huge
[21:14] thing I think there's a lot of um
[21:16] basically I at the Reds I guess it
[21:18] sounds like at the Pirates too you know
[21:21] there is a culture of like hey you need
[21:23] to like your job shouldn't be your 100%
[21:25] life right and like when that's the
[21:27] priority when people from all the way at
[21:29] the top down are saying that it actually
[21:32] helps you know it lets me go to the
[21:34] people I work with and say hey we just
[21:36] pushed through whatever project we spent
[21:39] four months on it it was a big deal we
[21:41] did crunch probably we probably put some
[21:42] extra time in hey if you need to like
[21:45] this is the window to be flexible and we
[21:47] try to find that identify it um it is
[21:51] not the same as like a normal nine to
[21:53] five you know um billable hour situation
[21:57] or anything like that
[21:59] um you know there are days that are very
[22:06] long Luke you want to um Talk uh sort of
[22:09] uh I guess answering the previous
[22:11] question um getting back to that but you
[22:14] could also talk about work life balance
[22:15] being a PhD student because I imagine
[22:17] there might not
[22:19] be it might not be great yeah I'm not
[22:22] sure if I'm I'm the right one to ask on
[22:25] that yeah
[22:29] no uh to your original
[22:31] question I think like a fair question
[22:34] for me is you know why haven't why don't
[22:37] I have a job in sports right now and you
[22:39] know is that something I eventually want
[22:42] to do I think that's a question I asked
[22:44] myself a lot um why like I didn't pursue
[22:48] a a full-time career in sports uh right
[22:52] out of undergrad say is I have other
[22:55] interests as well and I I I think thing
[22:58] about sports which is becoming
[23:02] um you know bigger and bigger is that
[23:05] there's ways to contribute in it without
[23:07] it being your full-time job and I'm not
[23:09] so sure that that's always true in other
[23:12] Industries you know like if if I I have
[23:15] interest in kind of medicine or public
[23:17] health and I think that you know doing a
[23:21] full-time job in sports and would kind
[23:24] of require me to give up that part of my
[23:27] passion
[23:29] um you know I'm fortunate enough that
[23:32] some of the research that I do as part
[23:34] of my PhD can be on Sports
[23:36] analytics um I work as a consultant for
[23:39] the ivy league on problems related to
[23:41] scheduling and tiebreakers and so I
[23:44] think that that kind of scratches the
[23:46] itch of you know doing meaningful work
[23:49] in sports analytics uh while kind of
[23:52] maintaining my other Hobbies uh but
[23:55] that's not to say that you know it's not
[23:57] still something something that I I think
[23:59] about and consider and you know I'm kind
[24:01] of fortunate that I have a little bit of
[24:03] time left before I have
[24:05] to get a job fulltime um but that that I
[24:10] think that you
[24:11] know even as someone up here on the
[24:13] panel it's like an ongoing debate for me
[24:16] so it shouldn't be like
[24:17] a you know a scary thing if if some
[24:21] people out there are having the same
[24:22] kind of thoughts if you had to estimate
[24:24] the probability Academia verse industry
[24:27] what would it be right
[24:29] now and has that changed over time can
[24:31] you sketch a like a a line uh a Academia
[24:36] probability chart behind you yeah I mean
[24:38] I I actually I actually think that it's
[24:41] it's like probably pretty low and I
[24:42] think that it's it's it's kind of funny
[24:45] I knew going into my PhD that I didn't
[24:47] want to be like a
[24:50] professor I think there's a lot of
[24:52] things I like about Academia and doing
[24:55] research and I I think actually a lot of
[24:57] those um same qualities are kind of the
[25:02] fun things that I would find appealing
[25:04] about working in a sports team right you
[25:06] kind of work on intellectually
[25:07] stimulating problems there's not always
[25:09] a right or clear answer I think that you
[25:14] know like any
[25:16] uh any job but particularly I think in
[25:19] Academia there's a lot of red tape um so
[25:23] I think that whatever I end up wanting
[25:24] to do it will kind of
[25:26] maximize doing research working on
[25:29] intellectually stimulating problems um
[25:31] having really good collaborators from
[25:34] diverse uh backgrounds you know I've
[25:37] actually found that every um team that
[25:40] I've been a part of has had people from
[25:43] kind of uh different paths to get there
[25:46] and and those have been the most fun and
[25:48] most productive teams I've been on and
[25:51] you know whether that's in sports or
[25:53] some kind of like industry research
[25:55] setting um I guess TBD but
[25:59] that's sort of the function that I'm
[26:00] trying to maximize right
[26:03] now
[26:05] cool
[26:10] Emily I was last twice just so you're
[26:13] aware you can be first
[26:15] next um oh okay so um I guess my career
[26:22] path so far is pretty short um but I
[26:25] this might be kind of relatable at least
[26:27] um with was nearing like the end of grad
[26:30] school I wasn't really sure if I wanted
[26:31] to do a
[26:32] PhD um and I kind of had that like
[26:35] enough time I just finished like I said
[26:38] I took a sports sance course I found it
[26:40] really interesting I finished it and had
[26:42] enough time but was also kind of like
[26:43] okay I need to find a job
[26:45] probably um and I gave myself I guess
[26:49] kind of like a little window of like
[26:51] okay I want to try and see if I can do
[26:53] something in sports and if I can't find
[26:54] it okay well then I'll switch gears and
[26:56] just try to find a job in general to pay
[26:59] the bills um and I got I say I got lucky
[27:04] um and ended up getting a job in the
[27:07] window but um got hired still while I
[27:09] was in grad school um at volleyball
[27:11] Canada and I've basically been there
[27:13] since um and they were great kind of
[27:16] letting me finish out grad school while
[27:17] also working for a little while um but
[27:21] yeah do you want me to comment on work
[27:22] life balance at all yes okay um so I for
[27:28] a governing body of sport we call them
[27:30] like national sport organizations um so
[27:33] nsos um we had this is like on a side
[27:37] sorry um what we call high performance
[27:39] Summit which is kind of just like
[27:40] comparing for like high performance
[27:42] Sports and we just did one within
[27:43] volleyball Canada so like beach indoor
[27:45] and sitting um and they made this joke
[27:48] of like in in high performance sport um
[27:51] there's like a ledge or um a peak and on
[27:55] one side of the peak there's like a
[27:56] valley that's like home and on the other
[27:59] side it's like work and that we always
[28:01] struggle to kind of sit equally in the
[28:03] middle um sometimes we're heavy into one
[28:05] and sometimes we're heavy into the other
[28:08] um I work with the beach teams we have
[28:10] 11 months of the year we are in season
[28:12] we have 20 athletes teams within the
[28:14] teams and there's like no off season
[28:16] like I basically feel like I have teams
[28:18] in they have teams in guadara right now
[28:20] where it's just like there's something
[28:21] going on at all moments in time um I
[28:25] feel worse for our coaches where it's
[28:27] like they have a lot more going on and
[28:30] um they don't necessarily have the
[28:32] flexibility that what we call our
[28:34] integrated support team would have um so
[28:36] there are times where it's um not great
[28:40] Paris is probably going to be one of
[28:41] them um but there are times where we try
[28:43] to kind of like capitalize on those like
[28:45] lower moments where it's like um Easter
[28:48] weekend we do the same with our athletes
[28:49] we give our athletes like a longer
[28:51] Easter weekend um internal so taking the
[28:54] longer Easter weekend for ourselves um
[28:57] to kind of like even that out a little
[28:59] bit I would also say that Olympic sports
[29:01] are a lot um Elliot can probably agree
[29:03] with me a lot poorer than um than like
[29:06] professional sports teams um so
[29:09] sometimes we can be worn thin um which
[29:12] isn't fun um but it kind of comes with
[29:14] the territory I guess of like working in
[29:16] Olympic
[29:19] sport I mean besides the fact that I'm
[29:21] shocked that you can play beach
[29:23] volleyball in Canada for 11 months um
[29:26] but we have indoor courts okay
[29:29] no I was gonna say um one of the
[29:32] things okay so
[29:36] snow I I'm I'm teasing I am a dual
[29:39] Canadian citizen so um but um I was
[29:43] going to say work like around work life
[29:45] balance one thing I I struggled with for
[29:47] a long time was you know Sports was like
[29:50] a huge hobby of mine Sports analytics
[29:52] like it was a huge Hobby and then it
[29:54] became a career and then I was like
[29:58] what's my hobby right because like
[29:59] everything I did which used to be my
[30:02] hobby and used to be fun like I I
[30:04] personally don't believe in the well if
[30:06] you love your job you never work in day
[30:07] in your life slogan um because it's
[30:10] still a job like and although I did have
[30:13] you know good bosses at ESPN despite me
[30:15] joking earlier like it's still a job you
[30:17] still have to answer to people you still
[30:19] have deadlines you still have things to
[30:20] do and all those things cause stress
[30:22] even if you love like the actual work
[30:24] there's still stress involved and so you
[30:28] know Accord you know what some of you
[30:30] have also said is you know it's really
[30:31] important to have other Hobbies like if
[30:33] you want to work in sports that's
[30:34] awesome and I encourage everyone to do
[30:36] that but don't let that be like your
[30:38] only hobby or your only passion because
[30:40] then you won't have any left when it's
[30:42] your full-time
[30:47] job um this is I guess kind of tagging
[30:50] on sorry um that like I played growing
[30:54] up so like I play in an indoor recck
[30:55] League like a retired person that I am
[30:58] um and I have friends that are and I
[31:02] have friends that are like oh my God
[31:03] like you never talk about your job you
[31:04] never talk about your job but I don't
[31:05] tell anybody when I go to these things
[31:07] like what I do or where I work or
[31:09] anything because it's kind of that me
[31:11] trying to give a divide of like this is
[31:12] me this is my personal life I'm going to
[31:15] keep my day job out of it um just to
[31:19] give that kind of like divide even
[31:21] though they are related like I said it's
[31:22] basically the same kind of thing um but
[31:25] yeah trying to keep them separate
[31:26] sometimes is hard um sometimes feels
[31:28] like you're keeping secrets but it's
[31:29] really just to give yourself like your
[31:31] own little personal like sanity I guess
[31:35] right
[31:37] incog yeah I don't wear any gear like
[31:42] nothing the only thing I was gonna add
[31:44] on to it actually a lot of that
[31:45] resonated and and uh I suppose I do have
[31:48] hobbies outside of baseball but
[31:51] um for me one thing I I actually have
[31:54] really liked about working baseball and
[31:56] I am someone who thinks about
[31:58] honestly baseball all the time is there
[32:00] is a lot of variety within the sport and
[32:03] um I I do think like your job if you're
[32:06] looking to work in sports you can also
[32:08] seek variety within your role um and and
[32:11] not every role would probably be equal
[32:13] but for for us research and development
[32:15] at baseball season you go from thinking
[32:18] about offseason moves and player
[32:20] evaluation and deeper research to
[32:23] getting ready for a season communicating
[32:25] a lot with stakeholders uh educating
[32:28] people implementing things to the
[32:30] amateur draft where you're thinking
[32:32] about 18y olds and 21 year olds as
[32:34] opposed to fully mature Major Leaguers
[32:37] uh Player Development and things like
[32:39] that
[32:40] so that is not sufficient variety for
[32:44] everyone like that might resonate with
[32:46] some of you and and not others but I do
[32:48] think that's something that like really
[32:50] keeps basball and research and
[32:53] development like very Lively to me if I
[32:54] had to do one exact sort of project
[32:58] every day you know for a year I probably
[33:00] would wear out very fast and not find it
[33:02] so novel all the
[33:04] time so some of you sort of touched on
[33:07] this um we talking about pros and cons
[33:09] and and um and stuff like that but was
[33:13] curious if there's anything that you
[33:14] really miss or you feel like you're
[33:17] missing out on with your current job do
[33:20] you have fomo about anything or do you
[33:23] ever
[33:25] um do you think that at some point in
[33:28] the future you will want to change your
[33:32] career like um it might be hard to to
[33:36] answer if you're you don't maybe you
[33:38] don't want to talk about it publicly I
[33:39] guess if you're currently likeing for a
[33:41] team or something but like I sort of
[33:43] know knew I asked because I knew when I
[33:45] went into the sports industry that I
[33:47] would eventually go back to Academia
[33:48] because I really like teaching and and
[33:51] so I didn't know if it' be five 10 years
[33:54] 20 years or whatever but I knew I would
[33:56] go back eventually so I'm just C ious if
[33:58] there's any anything um anything like
[34:01] that with any of you I know Luke has a
[34:03] fixed decision coming up so you already
[34:06] kind of talked about that but I'm
[34:08] curious you know if anyone else has sort
[34:10] of thought about this you have fomo
[34:12] about other career paths regrets things
[34:15] like that I'll respond quickly and pass
[34:17] off the my big time fomo guy all the
[34:19] time and uh I what I want to work in
[34:24] baseball the next 30 Years um I
[34:28] was really influenced by one of my
[34:30] former bosses uh at the Chicago Cubs
[34:33] theep who uh put a Time onine himself
[34:35] myself 10 years with the team uh and you
[34:38] know I myself uh in research and
[34:41] development specifically with six years
[34:42] with the Cubs but then you know it was
[34:44] about 10 years um total with them across
[34:47] roles and I I think there's something to
[34:50] that when you go somewhere else you
[34:52] create new things you have to create new
[34:54] connections that's revitalizing uh
[34:57] there's it test you in new ways and so
[34:59] um that's that's for me how I in part
[35:02] seek
[35:04] variety I was going to say when I was at
[35:06] ESPN one of the things I felt like I had
[35:08] fomo of is that you know I we it was
[35:12] awesome in the sense that like we worked
[35:13] on different sports and so like I got to
[35:16] do football projects I got to do
[35:18] basketball projects I did a very very
[35:21] little hockey project one time I you
[35:23] know but I got to do a few soccer you
[35:25] know different things but then I always
[35:26] felt like when I would go to conferences
[35:29] I be like oh my gosh look at this
[35:30] awesome stuff that like this person who
[35:32] gets to spend a 100% of their time
[35:34] thinking about just one sport how like
[35:36] smart they are about it or all the like
[35:38] new things that are being done and I'm
[35:40] just like running around like a chicken
[35:42] with his head cut off trying to keep up
[35:43] with like five different sports at once
[35:45] and so then of course my next job was
[35:47] like football and you know so I you know
[35:51] there's pros and cons to both right but
[35:52] like that's one thing I've always kind
[35:53] of struggled with it's like it's fun cuz
[35:55] I love all I love all sports right some
[35:57] more than others but I do love all
[35:58] sports and so it was fun to work in all
[36:00] of them but at the same time I was like
[36:01] oh but like I'm also feeling like I'm
[36:03] never caught
[36:05] up um I feel like i' probably have a few
[36:09] fos but again I get fomo about
[36:11] everything um I am also like not never
[36:15] want to like close a door I love
[36:18] chatting I love whatever so I'm always
[36:20] up like for new things or whatever and
[36:23] like that aspect of the world but fomo I
[36:25] feel like is definitely one I'm always
[36:28] like oh I want to do this and this and
[36:29] this and this and this and then I always
[36:30] get a we don't have the budget for that
[36:33] um so that one's always kind of like a
[36:35] hard pill to
[36:36] swallow um and then
[36:39] fomo
[36:41] great um so why don't we uh open it up
[36:45] to the audience to ask uh some questions
[36:48] of our
[36:49] panelists and we'll pass the mic around
[36:52] because uh this is being broadcast over
[36:54] Zoom um so we'll just ask you to wait to
[36:58] wait until you get a mic uh to ask your
[37:00] question so
[37:09] quickly
[37:12] Police makes me think of hey um so I
[37:16] know when you normally like think about
[37:19] like your interactions with sports you
[37:20] think of it as like a hobby or something
[37:22] you do for fun how has um like working
[37:26] in sports changed the way you view like
[37:29] you view the sport you work in like can
[37:30] you still like work in that sport or can
[37:33] you still like I guess like like watch
[37:36] it for fun in your leisure time or has
[37:39] that kind of
[37:44] changed feel like I sort of kind of
[37:46] answered this already but
[37:49] um I I mean it's it's like yes and no
[37:53] right to both of those
[37:55] um like I said like I I watched the
[38:00] least amount of ESPN of my life during
[38:03] the seven years I worked there um
[38:07] because like yeah I would W and when I
[38:10] would watch it would be to be like okay
[38:12] how how are the anchors using the model
[38:15] that I built and are they using it
[38:18] correctly and like that's a work
[38:20] question you know and it's like okay
[38:22] like you know Scott vanel like good job
[38:24] or oh maybe I should send an email to
[38:26] your researcher so they can explain this
[38:28] to you better um but at the same time
[38:31] right like I still love sports right and
[38:33] it's like it's not like I wouldn't watch
[38:35] like the NBA finals or something just
[38:37] because they would show our
[38:39] probabilities before the game like you
[38:41] know I would still watch but you know it
[38:43] was a little bit more stressful knowing
[38:44] that like oh like if I did something and
[38:47] it gets on TV which is awesome because I
[38:49] remember the first time that happened
[38:50] too and I was like oh my gosh you know
[38:52] like I look like I like I called my
[38:54] whole like called everyone I knew like
[38:57] look at this I like took a screenshot
[38:58] you know and like this like I did this
[39:02] um but yeah you know so it's like it's a
[39:04] mixed bag like yes it's it is work so
[39:06] it's a little bit different experience
[39:07] than it used to be but you can still
[39:09] enjoy it it's just it's like you have to
[39:11] pick your battle sometimes at least
[39:13] that's my
[39:15] experience that moment's exciting when
[39:17] it works and the Fielder's not in the
[39:19] wrong spot um the a few things maybe
[39:23] change one is uh the Sport's way more
[39:26] complex and the the inside
[39:29] decision-making minations are more
[39:31] complex than even a lot of like
[39:34] analytically forward analysis fully
[39:37] realizes um and and probably for good
[39:40] reasons and problematic bad reasons um
[39:44] but it's it's that's one big thing a
[39:47] second thing uh you might not watch
[39:51] games in their entirety anymore uh you
[39:55] might be working during a game you might
[39:57] be catching the first few Innings and
[40:00] then turn into something else so that if
[40:04] um that that just that nature of um
[40:07] enjoying the sport is a little bit
[40:09] different you might be truly watching it
[40:11] through a spreadsheet or video or
[40:13] watching multiple games at a time um
[40:16] trying to
[40:17] think I I think I think those would be a
[40:20] couple things I might
[40:22] miss I think that that's like a pretty
[40:25] fair way though of like when you're
[40:26] working for a team in particular you
[40:28] know you're going to see a lot of game
[40:30] footage you're going to see the game in
[40:32] a lot of different ways but I would
[40:34] emphasize and I would assume it's
[40:36] somewhat similar like when a guy hits a
[40:39] ball really really far it's really
[40:41] really fun still like it doesn't matter
[40:43] when you're like I understand that this
[40:44] is a problem of exit velocity or
[40:46] whatever you know stat cast however they
[40:48] want but you're like he hit ball far
[40:50] that's very cool um which is probably
[40:53] like some selection into like why you
[40:55] work in the sport um if if that that's
[40:58] still really enjoyable no matter how
[41:00] many time how many hours in a week you
[41:02] spend thinking about how do we do this
[41:04] more
[41:08] often I I did remember just one one
[41:11] thing I would add one of the things I've
[41:13] actually enjoyed the most about being
[41:15] attached and and you can do this with
[41:17] your own research as well or as you um
[41:20] put out names if if you're even if
[41:22] you're not working with team is um
[41:24] seeing whatever is black and white in
[41:26] the moment of a decision or a player
[41:28] being better than another how gray it
[41:30] becomes later is I think a fascinating
[41:33] part about just making this your your on
[41:36] you know constant thing um that it just
[41:39] never is so linear clear um and and
[41:42] that's the learning process that that's
[41:44] actually what I've enjoyed the most and
[41:46] how I've evolved the most is watching
[41:47] how results are never quite what you
[41:50] thought at the time uh and and you kind
[41:52] of keep adapting to
[41:55] that you want to I was going to say one
[41:57] of the most interesting things is when
[41:59] you work in sports and you watch games
[42:02] is the internal struggle in your soul of
[42:06] like oh like that was awesome but I know
[42:08] that was a stupid thing for that player
[42:10] to do or maybe it wasn't a bad decision
[42:12] but like that was still awesome because
[42:14] like the ball went in or like it was a
[42:15] home run or like he probably shouldn't
[42:17] have swung at that pitch but like hey he
[42:18] hit out of the park awesome right and
[42:20] you're always kind of like having that
[42:21] internal debate of like enjoying the
[42:24] sport versus like analyzing it at the
[42:26] same time
[42:28] I feel like my answer is probably really
[42:29] different um I grew up playing indoor um
[42:33] I played indoor in University and now I
[42:34] work for the beach teams and although I
[42:36] played Beach like recreationally I
[42:38] wouldn't say I played it as competitive
[42:39] as the athlete so like you'd watch it in
[42:42] Tokyo or I'd watch it in Tokyo but that
[42:43] was the extent of it um so then now I
[42:47] feel like
[42:48] watching like just beach volleyball in
[42:50] general is part of my job because I
[42:53] didn't really watch it leisurely before
[42:56] um but I also work um I don't know how
[42:59] Clos you guys work with like athletes
[43:01] but I work with the athletes close
[43:03] enough that I know them and I know them
[43:05] fairly well so I try to like I guess
[43:07] wear both hats where it's like I'm
[43:09] watching the game and yes I'm thinking
[43:10] about all the things going on at work
[43:12] but I'm also trying to remember that
[43:13] like I know the these people are human
[43:15] and I know them like as people um and I
[43:18] want them to succeed even if it isn't
[43:20] necessarily kind of what the game plan
[43:22] was going in um so you were like kind of
[43:24] cheering for them on on one hand and
[43:27] hoping everything goes well and they win
[43:29] um and yeah it's kind of again I guess
[43:31] an internal battle while you're watching
[43:32] it um but uh yeah I think that's all I
[43:37] have to
[43:39] say oh but I watch other sports and I
[43:41] feel like when you don't work in other
[43:43] sports it's a lot easier to be like
[43:44] Leisure about it
[43:47] yeah so this was kind of just touched on
[43:49] a bit but um kind of a two-part question
[43:52] is one not on a very serious note what
[43:56] is it like watching
[43:57] the sport that you work in with friends
[43:59] that don't work in the industry and two
[44:03] with your co-workers you still have like
[44:05] sport conversations that are super like
[44:08] non-analytical and just like oh I think
[44:10] LeBron's the goat because he
[44:14] is um I guess I'll go um okay the first
[44:18] one is I as much as I love my family I
[44:22] find my family the most annoying to
[44:24] watch with because they start asking
[44:25] questions about like the player spe
[44:28] what's their name and and and I'm just
[44:30] like okay just watch the game um but
[44:33] yeah sometimes I feel like when I'm
[44:35] watching with like friends or something
[44:36] I I try to think of it as like more of a
[44:39] Pastime instead of like work so I try to
[44:41] just keep that part away from me yeah
[44:43] sometimes they'll ask questions but um
[44:46] like try to keep it minimal and then
[44:47] also just like if I don't want to answer
[44:49] it I don't want to talk about it I'm
[44:50] like yeah I can't talk about it um even
[44:53] if I'm just kind of not in the mood um
[44:55] and the second part of the question was
[44:57] was somebody WR emotional debates right
[45:00] oh um we have a lot of athletes and
[45:03] coaches that are super big into betting
[45:05] and I'm really not at all into the
[45:07] vetting world and sometimes they'll be
[45:09] like oh tell me who's going to do X Y
[45:11] and Z and I'm like um this one and I
[45:15] just like spit it out just because
[45:16] that's what I was feeling in the moment
[45:18] and I tell them that I'm like don't take
[45:19] my word for it but like this is my guess
[45:22] sometimes I'll verify and give them
[45:23] whatever if they want sure um but yeah
[45:27] yeah sometimes I'll contribute to those
[45:28] like debates like the recent one was
[45:31] March Madness so they play March Madness
[45:34] um in the wait room when they're working
[45:35] out and they're like always watching
[45:38] something so like sometimes I'll come in
[45:39] and just chime in um even though I
[45:42] probably know nobody's name or know some
[45:44] names but not everybody's name in
[45:46] college basketball and I'll just like
[45:47] make a comment and just to stir the Pod
[45:49] almost and then like
[45:51] leave so then they kind of like have
[45:53] this big debate um which is kind of
[45:55] funny but so yeah sometimes I guess I
[45:59] mean everybody likes to shoot the a
[46:00] little bit so I feel like you do it just
[46:02] for fun oh sorry pleas please no
[46:05] swearing say I I love my father but
[46:09] watching watching sports with him has
[46:11] become unbearable as an adult so um it's
[46:14] just it's just things like you know H
[46:16] complain get my dad actually watches
[46:18] he's he likes to ref and so he actually
[46:20] watches the officials sometimes over the
[46:23] actual game itself which just in general
[46:25] is really annoying but but um second is
[46:29] you know he'll complain about decisions
[46:31] and I'll be like like but actually that
[46:33] like is kind of optimal now like I know
[46:35] we didn't used to do it that way but
[46:37] like it wasn't optimal then and it's
[46:40] still not optimal now to do what you
[46:41] want to do um but he you know I don't
[46:44] want to get into the whole debate
[46:46] because you know we're a stubborn bunch
[46:48] and no one will ever yield so I I
[46:50] typically just keep my mouth shut and
[46:52] enjoy his company
[46:54] so a
[47:01] I would add getting younger family
[47:04] involved is a lot of fun we watch Red's
[47:07] games with my uh nieces who are um born
[47:11] three so like the level of Engagement is
[47:14] not that suboptimal it's like I like him
[47:18] he's he's fast and you're like yep he's
[47:20] fast and like but like it creates those
[47:22] experience like those are like right I
[47:24] think it's like those are the
[47:26] experiences
[47:27] at least for me that got me into sports
[47:29] I was like sitting down and watching it
[47:30] with older family members who are just
[47:32] like yeah isn't it fun and like when you
[47:35] can share that and it takes you a little
[47:37] bit out of that like the anxiety of like
[47:39] I've put some work on the line here it's
[47:45] nice yeah I I'll just say like my um my
[47:50] dad is kind of similar to
[47:52] Paul you know I I think he's open-minded
[47:55] about trying to you know like we'll be
[47:58] watching some game and like he'll he'll
[48:01] complain in NBA they shoot too many
[48:03] threes and you know I like sort of say
[48:06] well like a contestant mid-range jumper
[48:09] while aesthetically maybe more pleasing
[48:11] is not a very good shot and I think he
[48:14] he listens but
[48:16] um it it it resonated me with me what
[48:19] you
[48:21] said exactly
[48:26] I was say I have a son and he always
[48:28] asks me who's the best who's this is so
[48:30] and so better or so and so better and
[48:32] I'm all I mean that also is like uh I'm
[48:35] a statistician so uh it's uncertain and
[48:42] that's so from the academic side so I'm
[48:46] a professor and I teach students and I
[48:49] want to know a couple things uh first
[48:51] question is what statistics or data
[48:55] science skill do you think
[48:57] you use the most and would want someone
[49:00] who is entering your organization to
[49:02] know like to have learned in graduate
[49:03] school or
[49:05] undergrad and the um second one is I
[49:09] always have students ask me how do I get
[49:12] into sports analytics or into a uh make
[49:15] myself known so that I can get a job so
[49:18] one of those two questions and maybe
[49:20] they're related
[49:27] stop on this for a little
[49:29] bit
[49:31] um I don't know that there's one magic
[49:34] Silver Bullet skill um the ones I like
[49:37] to tell people are you should know SQL
[49:40] enough to like select from where Group
[49:42] by join it's helpful um I forget what
[49:46] the tech survey this year was but it's
[49:47] like every team has got some large
[49:51] sequel setup in Major League Baseball I
[49:53] assume it's the same in every other
[49:55] sport I assume it's the same at
[49:57] ESPN uh so you need to be able to get
[50:00] your data and then from there I like to
[50:01] think of it as you need to know
[50:04] regression pretty well um you should
[50:06] know something probably a little bit
[50:08] more advanced than regression so either
[50:10] machine learning but causal inference
[50:12] base like these are all really good
[50:13] Advanced topics know something about
[50:14] that um the more school you do I think
[50:17] the more you should
[50:18] know that advanced skill um and then
[50:22] communication and that that's data viz
[50:26] not actually to the degree of like
[50:27] Greg's art contest at JSM but you know
[50:30] it needs to be like coaches if something
[50:33] doesn't look accessible won't read it
[50:36] right like so if you're working for a
[50:37] team you need needs to meet some minimum
[50:40] standard um but also you're you're
[50:41] writing you need to be able to write
[50:43] about data and Analysis in a way that is
[50:46] um accessible uh both to a technical
[50:48] audience right we write a lot of
[50:50] documentation uh but also to
[50:51] non-technology and you'll hear that
[50:53] about a lot of data science jobs but
[50:54] it's really true in sports where
[50:57] um I'll go from writing for my boss
[50:59] who's a neuroscience PhD to writing for
[51:02] guys who've played and coached baseball
[51:05] for 40 years and those are two very
[51:07] different um backgrounds right I can't
[51:09] write the same thing I always say I'd
[51:11] love to pay and you know to be a fly on
[51:12] the wall if somebody went in and talked
[51:13] about machine learning to David Bell
[51:16] like it'd be an interesting conversation
[51:19] um as to getting a job the biggest thing
[51:21] is to apply um you can do Sports
[51:23] analytics without being working for a
[51:25] team or ESPN Luke is a great example
[51:27] like do it do projects But ultimately if
[51:30] you want a job in the industry um you
[51:34] know talked to a few people today about
[51:36] this right there are 30 MLB teams
[51:38] there's like you know you multiply out
[51:40] by however many leagues you want to
[51:42] potentially work in in American
[51:44] Sports let's say on average every team
[51:46] hires two people a year that might be
[51:49] generous in some leagues and for some
[51:51] teams um in a bunch of different markets
[51:54] uh that's not a lot of jobs every year
[51:56] year that's not a lot of jobs that are
[51:58] necessary fulltime the best chance you
[52:00] have is to keep doing those projects
[52:02] while applying it could take a little
[52:04] while you know I don't mean to
[52:06] be negative about it but like it might
[52:09] take a while you just need to keep like
[52:11] persevering through that and continue
[52:16] applying yeah so I mean I don't work for
[52:18] a team so maybe I won't talk about what
[52:20] it takes to work for a team but I think
[52:22] that I'll just Echo the communication
[52:24] and data visualization part that uh Sean
[52:28] touched on I think that you know a
[52:31] common Pitfall a lot of people fall into
[52:35] is you know to spend like a lot of time
[52:37] working on some sophisticated model
[52:39] because that's what excites you and
[52:42] answers your question and then like the
[52:44] data visualization is just something
[52:46] that you need and like you obviously
[52:49] understand it because you've spent you
[52:50] know countless hours working on your
[52:52] project but ultimately the the person
[52:55] you know was whether you're working for
[52:57] a team or you know just working at some
[53:00] other job in general like the person who
[53:02] ultimately makes a decision based off of
[53:04] your project might look at that graph
[53:05] for 15 seconds and if they can't sort of
[53:09] get the clean takeaway that you spent
[53:11] four months working on in those 15
[53:13] seconds you probably didn't spend enough
[53:15] time working on your data visualization
[53:18] um or you know you didn't like
[53:20] communicate the take-home message uh
[53:23] effectively enough and so um I just
[53:27] think that like you know don't overlook
[53:29] the importance of such a basic um or
[53:34] like Elementary data science skill
[53:37] because it's not like as sexy as you
[53:39] know machine learning or some of these
[53:42] other like hot
[53:46] topics well Eko the the list already
[53:49] given is is great I don't really have
[53:51] too too much to add I feel like probably
[53:53] sport dependent and correct me if I'm
[53:55] wrong um anybody who knows the sport of
[53:57] volleyball knows it's kind of weird
[53:59] there's a lot of it's probably similar
[54:00] to like I find football hard to learn
[54:02] personally but um there there's a lot of
[54:05] like intricate little weird details and
[54:07] they do say every once in a while I hear
[54:08] people say it doesn't matter if you know
[54:09] anything about the sport um I would say
[54:12] that's probably sport dependent and team
[54:15] dependent um when there's not too many
[54:17] in a department I feel like knowing at
[54:19] least some something about the sport um
[54:22] is great um like I said volleyball is
[54:25] super Niche and then Beach on top of it
[54:26] has a lot more intricacies so like
[54:29] knowing those things can be very helpful
[54:31] I'm sure it's might be similar in other
[54:33] sports um so that can help and then I
[54:37] guess getting a job um I mean the worst
[54:40] anybody can do or say to you is no um
[54:43] which to me really isn't that bad so
[54:45] like don't be scared to like put
[54:47] yourself out there say hi talk to people
[54:49] request coffee chats whatever um but if
[54:53] you're GNA like want to talk to somebody
[54:56] um I usually say like do a little bit of
[54:59] research on who you're talking to get to
[55:01] know like them their background their
[55:03] path what they went through or asked
[55:05] them about it um and don't just come out
[55:07] flat and say like hey can I have a job
[55:09] um so like and and even sometimes I
[55:12] don't even mention you can just say I
[55:14] just want to work in sport I want to
[55:15] know how you got in there um that builds
[55:17] kind of like a foundation and a good
[55:19] network of like people in sports so that
[55:22] you know either when you're ready or
[55:23] when something's available maybe that
[55:25] you will be the first person that they
[55:26] think of or at least someone to be like
[55:28] heyy I saw this job I just wanted you to
[55:30] know that it was out there um so try to
[55:32] like build a good rapport and
[55:34] relationship um with people aside from
[55:37] like applying obviously but um and
[55:39] hopefully that will help I
[55:43] guess all right that's unfortunately all
[55:46] we have time for so let's give our panel
[55:48] a hand
