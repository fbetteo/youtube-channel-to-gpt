[00:00] well good morning everyone
[00:02] i'm jun yan a professor of statistics at
[00:06] yukon
[00:07] on behalf of the organizing committee
[00:09] the uconn statistical data science lab
[00:13] and the yukon department of statistics
[00:16] i'd like to extend a warm welcome to you
[00:18] all to the third uconn sports analytics
[00:21] symposium
[00:24] started in 2019
[00:26] a unique feature of this symposium is
[00:29] the focus on students
[00:30] the future workforce of sports analytics
[00:34] we try our best to make the symposium
[00:37] accessible to students in terms of
[00:39] technical level cost and space
[00:43] as of six o'clock this morning we have a
[00:46] 301 registrants
[00:48] about a third registered through our
[00:50] international hubs thank our partners of
[00:53] uh professor marcos preetus in brazil
[00:57] tension one in china and san hook on in
[01:00] korea
[01:02] we have three special guests to give
[01:05] welcoming remarks
[01:07] the first one is dr andy wannabe the
[01:11] interim president of the united
[01:13] university of connecticut
[01:15] please join me in welcoming dr awanabi
[01:26] thank you professor yan for that kind
[01:28] introduction
[01:30] uh it's great to be here uh welcome to
[01:32] all of the the students who are here the
[01:35] panelists the keynote speakers the
[01:37] people who will be running the workshops
[01:40] it's just going to i think it's going to
[01:41] be a fascinating symposium
[01:43] i'm particularly uh excited that our our
[01:47] panelists are all um experts are all
[01:50] women
[01:51] experts uh i i think is is fitting um
[01:55] particularly since at uconn where we're
[01:58] so
[01:59] invested in um as our many universities
[02:02] on our uh uh women women athletes
[02:06] so uh this is wonderful on behalf of the
[02:09] university of connecticut it's my
[02:10] pleasure to welcome all of the
[02:12] participants to the 2021 uconn sports
[02:15] athletics analytics symposium
[02:18] uh
[02:19] now as professor yan said it's in its
[02:21] third year and i know that the symposium
[02:24] has already grown significantly since it
[02:26] began which is a testament to the depth
[02:29] and breadth of interest in the field of
[02:30] sports analytics
[02:32] this is a growing discipline as you know
[02:34] that has applications everywhere from
[02:37] league offices to news media to the
[02:39] average fan in the bleachers
[02:42] as the use of data science and sports
[02:44] becomes more common demand for these
[02:46] skills will only grow
[02:48] this symposium therefore is not only a
[02:51] forum to demonstrate a fascinating
[02:53] application of statistical science it's
[02:56] a platform to shape the future of a
[02:58] growing industry
[03:00] the university of connecticut makes an
[03:02] ideal host we think for an event like
[03:04] this
[03:05] first and this probably goes without
[03:07] saying for this group but we do have a
[03:09] bit of a national profile in college
[03:11] athletics we're very proud of our women
[03:14] basketball players
[03:16] our coaching staffs draw on analytics
[03:19] and data when drawing up plays or
[03:21] filling out lineup cards which is
[03:23] increasingly the standard at all levels
[03:26] of athletic competition
[03:28] and and whether uh athletics teams are
[03:31] are are winning or are nationally
[03:33] recognized or not
[03:35] um they all rely on this to some to some
[03:38] extent and um
[03:40] and it's just very important
[03:42] also uconn is taking seriously the need
[03:44] to prepare students for participation in
[03:48] the growing field of data science
[03:50] with both an undergraduate major in data
[03:52] science and a master's of engineering in
[03:55] data science the university of
[03:57] connecticut is fully engaged in the
[03:59] development of this exciting discipline
[04:02] this symposium is an excellent
[04:04] demonstration of that commitment
[04:07] so in closing i won't say something as
[04:10] cliched as play ball
[04:12] but i will wish all participants the
[04:14] best in today's symposium i'm excited to
[04:17] learn what insights you gain from
[04:19] today's talks and i look forward to
[04:21] seeing how they will come to shape the
[04:23] future of sports analytics so thank you
[04:25] and enjoy the symposium
[04:28] thank you very much dr wannabe
[04:31] our next special guest is paul caddy
[04:34] head coach of uconn field hockey
[04:37] they just won a game yesterday and will
[04:39] play boston university tomorrow
[04:40] afternoon i'm very grateful for pause
[04:43] being here with us at this moment from
[04:45] his very busy schedule let's welcome
[04:47] paul
[04:50] thanks jun i i really appreciate uh the
[04:52] the honor to uh to open the symposium
[04:55] here and following dr aguinalbe is
[04:58] you know super nice of you to invite me
[05:00] um
[05:00] so i want to talk a little bit about uh
[05:02] how we use analytics within our within
[05:05] our program um so we we use a lot of uh
[05:09] video analytics
[05:11] and gps data
[05:13] to forge
[05:14] uh tacticals
[05:16] and
[05:18] physiological things for our team
[05:20] so they become a really key factor uh
[05:23] for us in uh
[05:26] kind of finding the secret the slight
[05:28] edge uh between winning and losing um so
[05:30] we're very fortunate here that we have
[05:32] the statistical department and a great
[05:34] sport science department which are the
[05:35] two factors that have become really key
[05:38] in elite sport um in finding those small
[05:41] edges between the competition
[05:43] um so i just wanted to talk a little bit
[05:45] about the background of how i i came
[05:47] upon jun and his departments
[05:49] so
[05:50] a good friend of mine is the head coach
[05:52] of dartmouth and uh he uh he called me
[05:54] and he's like
[05:56] you have a sports symposium at uconn um
[05:59] and uh with it with analytics um and you
[06:02] should reach out to jun and so i did um
[06:06] and we we developed a nice relationship
[06:08] and we had a conversation with uh myself
[06:10] john and greg one of his former students
[06:13] um
[06:14] and the beginning of the conversation uh
[06:16] we started talking about the gps data
[06:19] um and you know both of them were on the
[06:22] edge of their seats as we talked about
[06:23] gps data
[06:25] and
[06:26] they said how many years data do you
[06:28] have and and i said i think we have
[06:30] about five
[06:32] um and for for for jun and greg it was
[06:35] like christmas day um and
[06:39] you know for all of us within our own
[06:41] individual fields we feel passion and
[06:43] excitement um for what we do in our
[06:46] daily lives and for me to to to feel
[06:49] that passion and excitement from june
[06:50] and greg was was unbelievable um and it
[06:53] made me even more interested in the
[06:55] analytics uh part of our part of our
[06:58] product here at uconn with our field
[06:59] hockey um so it's with my uh uh honor i
[07:04] uh open help uh introduce and open uh
[07:07] this sports uh analytics symposium at
[07:09] uconn and uh and i thank jun uh for um
[07:13] uh uh having me in the uh sports
[07:16] analytics kind of community at uconn
[07:21] well thank you very much paul and good
[07:22] luck tomorrow
[07:24] thank you so much yeah
[07:26] uh
[07:26] our last special guest is seth partner
[07:30] special advisor to the ceo
[07:32] at
[07:34] statsbond
[07:35] seth also provides mba and basketball
[07:38] analytics for the athletic
[07:41] and he was formerly the director of
[07:43] basketball research for the milwaukee
[07:45] bucks let's welcome seth
[07:49] uh thank you for professor yan thank you
[07:52] for having me uh
[07:54] the
[07:54] when i was wondering what uh i should
[07:57] talk about today uh professor yan was
[07:59] kind enough to
[08:01] to give me some advice that the the
[08:03] topic he's most interested in hearing
[08:06] on is what a university like connecticut
[08:09] and and sort of academic institutions in
[08:12] general can do
[08:14] to
[08:15] advance the field of sports analytics
[08:17] but more importantly prepare students
[08:19] uh for for careers for for
[08:23] to enter almost the the workforce in
[08:25] sports analytics and really the the
[08:28] skills and and and traits which are
[08:30] valuable in in sports analytics are
[08:33] uh broadly transferable across the the
[08:36] sort of the wide range of
[08:37] of applications of data in in industry
[08:40] so it's not just sort of the narrow
[08:43] um the the the small yet growing field
[08:45] of people working in and around
[08:48] sports whether professional collegiate
[08:50] well what have you um
[08:53] the first thing and i think this is it's
[08:54] it's really wonderful that this
[08:55] symposium is doing this is is having the
[08:58] the concurrent sessions that are this
[09:00] afternoon which are actually providing
[09:02] uh some some hands-on training with some
[09:04] of the tools that are are very important
[09:07] uh you know there's the i see that
[09:09] there's there's in intros to r and
[09:11] python and um
[09:14] everything up to web scraping just
[09:16] figuring out how to find and manipulate
[09:18] data i think that's
[09:21] that is a key skill uh and it is
[09:23] necessary but it's not
[09:26] it's necessary but not sufficient for
[09:28] performing these jobs uh but
[09:31] um
[09:32] getting the data
[09:33] is is the first step and and really the
[09:36] two traits that i think that
[09:38] should really be focused on uh
[09:40] instilling in the traits and skills i
[09:42] think should the uh academia should be
[09:44] focused in instilling in students are
[09:46] um the ability to communicate and the
[09:49] ability to to be creative um usually
[09:53] when when communication is discussed in
[09:55] the context of sports analytics it's
[09:58] it's about um the presentation whether
[10:00] it's your data visualization your
[10:03] your your written work uh getting in
[10:05] front of of
[10:06] stakeholders whether it's coaches or
[10:08] personnel decision makers or ownership
[10:11] and and speaking i want to talk about it
[10:13] a little bit more as on the other end
[10:15] sort of the the receiving end of
[10:17] communication because i think that's an
[10:19] area where
[10:20] uh the things things can fall down as
[10:23] well um
[10:24] really becoming attuned to
[10:27] um
[10:28] listening to the problem someone has
[10:31] even if they don't
[10:33] exactly have the vocabulary in
[10:37] in statistical or mathematical or data
[10:39] science computer science terms
[10:42] as you progress in those skills you kind
[10:45] of learn the the jargon the term journal
[10:48] the the terms of art um if if you're
[10:50] working with a coach or a player or a
[10:53] general manager they won't know those
[10:55] terms they'll know what they want they
[10:57] might try to ask
[10:59] a question
[11:00] in a statistical format but that's not
[11:02] really what they want to know
[11:04] if if someone asks for who is the
[11:08] the best three-point shooter in the nba
[11:10] they're not asking you who has the
[11:12] highest three-point percentage they're
[11:14] asking something much more complicated
[11:17] uh and much more nuanced uh and that
[11:19] gets to my second point which is which
[11:21] is uh creativity
[11:23] um
[11:24] taking that question that that as you
[11:27] understand and really
[11:29] um
[11:30] engaging your imagination in the the
[11:32] best way to
[11:33] approach an answer to it um
[11:36] sports analytics as a still developing
[11:38] field is
[11:39] uh has both the opportunity and the
[11:41] challenge that we're largely making it
[11:43] up as we go
[11:45] so
[11:46] there isn't always a road map for how to
[11:48] do something or what the right stat to
[11:50] use is or
[11:52] how to create what you want to create so
[11:54] that's where uh
[11:56] as as an analyst you have to engage your
[11:59] creativity in
[12:01] okay here's the data i have availability
[12:04] what is the best approach i can use from
[12:06] a from a technical standpoint from a
[12:08] presentational standpoint from a
[12:10] communication standpoint to
[12:12] uh
[12:13] give the information give the give the
[12:15] answer give a story
[12:17] of of that that properly answers the
[12:20] question
[12:21] that's that that whoever is i'm dealing
[12:24] with has asked um and those things are
[12:26] are are very difficult it's it's it's
[12:29] it's difficult but relatively easy to
[12:31] learn the technique um applying it via
[12:35] you know listening and being creative is
[12:38] much harder and it takes reps it takes
[12:40] humility it takes persistence
[12:42] and i think that the thing i would
[12:44] encourage um in in academia is really
[12:48] creating more opportunities for for
[12:51] students to to try and and frankly to
[12:54] try and fail um and on on on those
[12:57] things
[12:58] so that students can can uh
[13:01] learn to walk before they try to run in
[13:03] in sort of the professional setting um
[13:06] so i think
[13:09] that's the admonishment i guess i would
[13:11] i would leave with and uh and again i
[13:12] thank uh professor yan for for allowing
[13:15] me to speak to you for a couple minutes
[13:21] thank you very much seth
[13:23] this concludes the welcoming remarks
