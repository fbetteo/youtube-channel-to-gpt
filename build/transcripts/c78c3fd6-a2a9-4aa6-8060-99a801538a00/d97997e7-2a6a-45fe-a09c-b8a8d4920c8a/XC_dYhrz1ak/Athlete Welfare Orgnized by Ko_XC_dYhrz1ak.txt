[00:01] okay so so saying was that basically the
[00:06] in in our simulation studies the more
[00:07] highly correlated bordering lead the um
[00:10] the more you are to win right this is
[00:12] this is a very this is an indication
[00:15] that um this is unfair right it there's
[00:18] there's a scale that by waiting this
[00:20] sort of two3 you're giving them you're
[00:23] giving the Bing the Bing lead climbers a
[00:25] uh a bigger Advantage right um oh boy
[00:32] okay and so then we also looked at like
[00:35] um for is the probability of
[00:39] course and for what's the probability of
[00:41] winning a medal if you won any of the
[00:43] events right so if you win any event
[00:45] what's the probability that you qualify
[00:46] and what's the probability that you uh
[00:48] win a medal in in the finals um and this
[00:51] is this is all based on those
[00:52] assumptions uh about uh correlation
[00:56] what's the in this simulation Kong any
[00:58] idea for this for these results don't
[01:01] remember I don't remember either but
[01:02] there was some correlation and these
[01:03] were the finals so basically if you win
[01:05] if you if you win an event you have a
[01:06] very high likelihood of of moving on to
[01:09] um you can see that the rank B eight if
[01:12] you if you win any of the events you're
[01:14] probably going to qualify um and you're
[01:16] but you're less likely to win a medal uh
[01:18] if you win an event you have to really
[01:19] do more than just win one event um these
[01:23] are the these are the placement scores
[01:25] we wanted to know like what if if our
[01:26] assumtions were correct about uniform
[01:28] stuff what was the
[01:30] um what was a score would would sort of
[01:33] get you to the next we found that a
[01:35] score of 453 would usually get you into
[01:37] the top eight and then in the finals
[01:39] scores of things like 9 19 and 33 would
[01:41] would were around the averages for gold
[01:43] silver and bronze just to give you some
[01:44] sort of idea about the scale of what
[01:46] these scores need to be to to um to
[01:49] qualify or to move on okay I this is
[01:54] more this is more interesting stuff than
[01:56] that that simulation study um this is a
[01:58] correlation analysis that we did we
[02:00] really wanted to know about what the
[02:02] correlation between bouldering and Lead
[02:04] um we assumed it was we assumed it was
[02:06] true because of this but let me let me
[02:07] show you actually what this looks like
[02:10] so coration between the overall Rank and
[02:12] the ranks of the individual disciplines
[02:14] uh here's a case study that we're going
[02:16] to use we're going to use Tokyo 2020
[02:17] women's qualification so what we're
[02:19] looking at is what is the correlation
[02:21] between your overall Rank and the rank
[02:23] within an individual discipline if the
[02:25] rank of the individual discipline is
[02:26] very highly correlated with your overall
[02:28] rank that means that that's relatively
[02:29] more importance to your overall rank
[02:31] right and so you can see here is that
[02:35] for for bouldering and Lead we get a
[02:37] kendle uh for for bouldering and Lead we
[02:39] got a kendle's t about 04 with very
[02:42] significant P values and for Speed uh
[02:45] it's basically not significant what this
[02:47] is saying is that if you are doing well
[02:49] and Bing in lead individually you more
[02:52] likely to do overall right so speed is
[02:55] sort of like this it's like this thrown
[02:57] in and it's really um it's hard to do
[03:00] overall if you're good if you're only
[03:01] good at speed right so it is kind of
[03:04] screwing the people who are uh speed
[03:06] Specialists which is a complaint that we
[03:08] heard um uh we can we can to visualize
[03:13] the underlying correlations that exist
[03:14] among climbing disb performances we use
[03:16] speed race time you have to use
[03:19] something called tops in bouldering in
[03:21] bouldering there's different there's
[03:23] different like Puzzles and you can score
[03:25] you can score Tes and then there's these
[03:27] intermediate scores and we used uh that
[03:30] as a measure for how good you did in the
[03:32] event and for lead it's the number of
[03:33] holds so we have that looks like this
[03:35] where you have uh for Speed you have
[03:38] theps and then you have the lead holds
[03:39] and these are all scored differently and
[03:41] so we were looking at uh correlations
[03:43] between these if you do a principal
[03:45] component analysis on these it's so this
[03:48] is a we place to do principal components
[03:50] because it's usually a high dimensional
[03:51] technique we're looking at three
[03:52] different dimensions but what you get is
[03:55] on this bot you see that leads and buing
[03:58] areally correlated and they're very very
[04:01] independent of speed and this is exactly
[04:03] why the speed climbers were like
[04:04] complaining and they were it was a valid
[04:06] complaint right this skill is so
[04:08] different than these skills right and
[04:11] they've weed this twice as heavily as
[04:13] they did uh for Speed all right the
[04:17] competion form is St against speed
[04:20] climbers this is what I think is the
[04:22] most interesting is the Leal analysis so
[04:26] my question
[04:28] was I'll just EXP we go to the next
[04:30] slide and explain
[04:31] it what happen to the overall rankings
[04:34] if one disqualified so in particular
[04:36] we're looking at one of the Medalist was
[04:38] qualified so there's this concept called
[04:41] uh the independence of relevant
[04:43] Alternatives and what this basically
[04:44] says is that um ranking in a competition
[04:49] should not depend on the inclusion or
[04:51] exclusion of someone else right and so
[04:53] if you have a good scoring system it
[04:54] shouldn't matter whether someone else
[04:56] competed or didn't compete your
[04:57] performance should be the same
[04:59] regardless of what other people are
[05:01] doing um so we want to check and see if
[05:03] there was violations of uh the
[05:06] independence irrelevant Alternatives the
[05:08] Assumption um and so what we did is we
[05:10] we basically said let's remove an
[05:12] individual give leave all the
[05:14] individuals with the same score and see
[05:16] would the rankings change should the
[05:18] rankings change no for the same
[05:20] performance if some just was removed or
[05:22] disqualified right you you then change
[05:24] the ranks because that person was
[05:25] removed but the overall ranking should
[05:27] not change if have a good scoring system
[05:32] well there's evidence of violation in in
[05:34] the real data so let's look at this I
[05:36] think this picture is my favorite
[05:38] picture and I think this is crazy that
[05:39] this happened at the Olympics so what
[05:43] what we're saying here is the this is
[05:45] this is um the actual final ranks of the
[05:48] the women in 2020 these were the scores
[05:51] and these were the ranks so then wanted
[05:53] to do was let's say let's take an
[05:55] individual climber out of it so in this
[05:57] one if we removed the person who
[05:58] finished first What would how the ranks
[06:00] change you basically just everyone
[06:01] shifts down nothing
[06:03] changes the ones that with the boxes
[06:05] there is a rank that changes so in this
[06:08] case what we're saying is if the person
[06:10] who finished second was removed from the
[06:12] competition and these four and these and
[06:14] theing five people had the exact same
[06:17] performances the exact same performances
[06:20] based on the changing of the ranks in
[06:21] individual events positions four would
[06:23] have flipped not big a deal were changed
[06:27] right but look at this one right here
[06:29] this is the top six if the person who
[06:31] was fifth simply was disqualified and
[06:34] they reranked everyone with the same
[06:36] exact performance the person who
[06:38] finished finished fourth would have gone
[06:40] up to a silver medal with the exact same
[06:43] performance simply removing someone
[06:46] would have Tak this person from for to a
[06:47] silver medal and this person would have
[06:49] dropped on a and this person would not
[06:50] have won a medal this is insane right
[06:53] it's it's not it's your your score is
[06:56] being like a major life accomplishement
[06:58] is being affected by this ranking system
[07:00] by this scoring system based on ranks
[07:02] right and just simply moving someone it
[07:04] shouldn't change your your it's the
[07:07] exact same performance so it shouldn't
[07:09] change where you're ranked in the final
[07:11] standings and yet it was changing the
[07:12] performance and this isn't theoretical
[07:14] right this isn't like um theorical
[07:17] violations of this is a real example of
[07:19] if you simply remove this person so
[07:21] imagine you go from the 20 qualif the
[07:24] top eight people qualify and then
[07:27] someone gets hurt now there's only seven
[07:29] people left
[07:30] that's a good real situation that could
[07:31] happen this is this is sort of the
[07:32] situation we're working with the leave
[07:33] one would be like someone got we remove
[07:35] them how does the ranks change with the
[07:37] exact same performance that's crazy
[07:39] that's happened to the Olympics anyway I
[07:41] think that's really interesting um
[07:45] takeways so the idea of climbing gives
[07:48] speed climbers a huge disadvantage
[07:50] the was was VI which is an issue of rank
[07:53] prodct scoring a solution to this might
[07:55] be 1 for Speed and one for bouldering
[07:58] and Lead which I believe
[08:00] is what's happening corre this is what's
[08:02] in
[08:03] 2024 it's on the next bll point it is
[08:06] confirmed Paris 2024 there'll be two
[08:07] sets of lead B combin speed
[08:11] only you
[08:13] know and here are the two people I
[08:15] worked with this is he's right there and
[08:18] there's Hannah she's a PhD student at
[08:20] Colorado State and this is how this
[08:23] started um I think this is informative
[08:26] because so this Lally tweeted at or
[08:28] maybe it's to DM but I
[08:30] said it's a
[08:34] tweet a week any interest and that's my
[08:38] old before was banned by
[08:42] Elon and so it started with this tweet
[08:44] and then we eventually wrote a paper and
[08:46] um we submitted it to the the Carnegie
[08:48] melon Sports and LS competition but this
[08:51] is this is how papers like this start
[08:52] just you see something think about write
[08:54] it down and then see where it goes and
[08:56] you know not every tweet that write
[08:58] becomes a paper but
[09:00] do and it's you just these ideas and see
[09:02] where they go and then WR a series of
[09:05] blog posts and then Kang has added this
[09:07] to the last slide oh this is from access
[09:10] 2021 and then here's the links for
[09:13] contacting Quang or myself and then he
[09:15] absolutely put this in
[09:19] here you
[09:24] yourself
[09:25] okay that's it how much time I done
[09:29] do you
[09:31] want you keeping the time or
[09:34] something
[09:36] oh like five more minutes did sure
[09:39] that's never happened before QA or not
[09:46] QA okay good that time
[09:49] back uh I'm not gonna call on you you
[09:51] can talk to me in the
[09:53] office what happened when you try
[09:55] comparing the product R versus the rank
[09:58] like
[10:04] people did we do some rank I don't know
[10:07] we looked at it very early on and found
[10:09] that it wasn't this interesting yeah it
[10:12] so this is this is several years ago if
[10:14] I remember correctly we looked at it it
[10:16] wasn't it wasn't it I believe it will
[10:19] still violate the IIA but nearly as
[10:22] drastic oh I mean like um let's say that
[10:25] hypothetically you were to pretend thatt
[10:27] use a some system would you like would
[10:30] the um results of the Olympics be
[10:33] changed if you switched from AIC to a St
[10:35] rank yeah so I I think the answer is yes
[10:38] but I think it's nearly as drastic right
[10:41] like um there it's it's well known
[10:44] there's there's a whole bunch of
[10:45] literature in sports economics about the
[10:47] violations OFA in like cross country but
[10:50] it's harder to find real examples of
[10:51] them I think it's I think with sport
[10:54] cling it's going to be or with the it's
[10:56] very easy to find examples where this
[10:57] goes wrong because it's
[11:00] the scoring system is so extreme if you
[11:01] finish
[11:02] first when you multip one it stays the
[11:05] same right and so it's it's a much more
[11:08] extreme there's an extreme prize for
[11:10] finishing first whereas in uh a
[11:13] finishing first isn't isn't nearly as
[11:15] valuable as finishing first in in a a
[11:19] Sun versus a rank so that's what I
[11:22] that's what I think if I remember from
[11:23] four years
[11:26] ago yeah have a few comments that's okay
[11:29] sure yeah yeah you gonna tear me down
[11:31] now no Build You Up okay um so I just
[11:34] looked at the results of sport climbing
[11:36] from Tokyo and all three men's medalists
[11:40] won one of the three segments so making
[11:43] your point like each one of them earned
[11:44] a
[11:45] one it was was it was the was the Bronze
[11:49] Metalist the speed climber 's
[11:53] see we looked events and it was it was
[11:56] we it was really hard to so Junior
[11:58] events there was qualifying events and
[12:00] we it was really hard to win uh as a
[12:03] speed climber at these events we were w
[12:05] we were seeing it um and so we were
[12:07] surprised that the speed climber
[12:09] actually did place in the men's side in
[12:10] the women's side none of these none of
[12:11] those
[12:13] three for whatever reason and um okay I
[12:18] can talk to you more later sure I gotta
[12:21] I gotta go she's yeah intimidating me
[12:23] off
[12:27] the one more round
[12:50] sorry yeah yeah
[12:56] y oh okay
[13:07] okay testing can everybody hear
[13:10] me is the mic seem to be working okay
[13:15] cool a little closer all right let's
[13:26] see it was better after you lowered it
[13:29] okay how's that is that better yeah
[13:32] let's people testing one two three can
[13:34] people online hear
[13:38] me
[13:40] [Laughter]
[13:42] something okay okay
[13:47] great there's any issues once I get I
[13:50] mean I I can use my teacher voice that
[13:51] would
[13:53] help
[13:55] okay um all right thank you very much
[13:58] for being here crowding this room this
[14:00] is really great to see this many people
[14:01] interested in Olympic sports um my um
[14:05] this paper this this uh work has
[14:08] actually been published in the American
[14:10] statistician and that QR code there will
[14:12] take you to the paper in which most of
[14:14] what you see here or a section of what
[14:16] you see here is written up this is track
[14:20] and field of course is the original
[14:21] Olympic sport um however um I am doing
[14:25] it at the high school level so um this
[14:29] does have implications for potential
[14:31] college recruitment which might have
[14:33] implications for Olympics in the future
[14:36] so track and field is extremely popular
[14:38] um there are greater than one million
[14:40] High School track and field athletes and
[14:42] that is a 2019 number it's probably
[14:45] larger now I'm sure it went down a
[14:47] little bit with covid and came back up
[14:48] again um trackfield was one of the top
[14:51] it was one of the top three most watched
[14:54] Olympic sports in Rio and the second
[14:56] most watched sport in the Tokyo Olympics
[14:59] can anyone guess what the other two are
[15:02] of the top three that are watched on
[15:04] television
[15:06] Spectators gymnastics is one swimming
[15:09] swimming yes okay I I should have
[15:11] brought fabulous prizes for you but I'm
[15:13] sorry you just get to know that you got
[15:14] it right okay um so and there were over
[15:18] 20 million viewers in these Sports so
[15:20] this is a really important Sport and um
[15:23] it's it deserves some attention as far
[15:25] as some data analytics going with it um
[15:28] so my inspiration for this is the girl
[15:30] on the left in this photo this is a 200
[15:33] meter dash in a track meet um she does
[15:35] actually wind up winning she pulls ahead
[15:37] at the very end makes it all very
[15:38] exciting um but athletic scholarships
[15:41] are perceived as a path to college
[15:43] education and that's why I wanted to
[15:45] look at high school scores and seeing
[15:48] how they might lead to college
[15:50] scholarships and later or what about an
[15:54] High School athlete can help a college
[15:56] coach in their recruiting but there's a
[15:59] lot of aspects to this and I don't
[16:00] intend to say that I have answered the
[16:04] question so if you go to any high school
[16:07] track meet this is how this started so
[16:09] like Greg started with a tweet mine
[16:11] started with conversations at a track
[16:12] meet typically if somebody says
[16:15] something like this after you watch a
[16:16] few races girls don't get any faster
[16:18] after their sophomore year especially
[16:19] for distance events so this begs the
[16:22] question on whether or not boys actually
[16:23] improve their times after their
[16:25] sophomore year and so this is where the
[16:26] notion of the sophomore Peak comes from
[16:29] sophomore being 10th grade in what we're
[16:32] talking about here um now I have this
[16:34] picture here because this is the Tokyo
[16:36] Olympics Allison Felix in the foreground
[16:38] is about 32 years old and this photo
[16:41] Sydney mlin in the background is about
[16:43] 22 years old okay so there's a 10-year
[16:46] difference in these athletes but they
[16:47] are performing at the same level I
[16:49] suppose one could argue that Allison
[16:52] Felix might be past her Peak at this
[16:54] point but I would think that her medals
[16:56] at the Tokyo Olympics might beg to
[16:58] differ with that so um I know that
[17:01] individual performance in athletes is
[17:03] very um well it's individual so um so we
[17:07] wanted to look at that and also look on
[17:09] the impact on recruitment for college I
[17:11] Believe by the way Alison Felix still
[17:14] holds the 200 meter High School record
[17:18] um at least that was true about four
[17:20] years ago in in 200 meter
[17:23] dash so recruiting rules um college
[17:26] recruiting can occur on June 15th after
[17:29] the completion of the sophomore year and
[17:32] my question was is the focus on athletes
[17:34] who have already peaked so if there is a
[17:36] sophmore Peak then we need to know that
[17:39] and if they're pick if the athletes who
[17:41] are recruited have already peaked what
[17:43] are the implications of that for the
[17:45] college sports and the relationship is
[17:48] um there's also this relationship
[17:49] between growth rate and Improvement
[17:51] which is understood but not necessarily
[17:53] implemented by coaches so um that people
[17:58] grow it at different rates we know that
[18:01] right so um and also people get better
[18:04] at their sport at different rates so you
[18:07] might have someone who doesn't Peak say
[18:09] until their senior year who is
[18:11] completely overlooked by somebody who uh
[18:14] by college coaches because they are
[18:16] thinking about the younger players and
[18:18] potenti younger
[18:21] athletes so the literature focus on this
[18:23] though has been in Peak Performance in
[18:25] college there's a lot of literature on
[18:27] that the to the literature though is on
[18:30] Peak Performance for elite athletes in
[18:32] general so not just for your person
[18:34] who's going to participate in high
[18:35] school potentially and not go forward
[18:37] but also for Peak perform but but um so
[18:40] these are people in the Olympics or
[18:42] other world class athletes and of course
[18:45] we find in most of those studies they
[18:47] pretty much all agree that between the
[18:50] ages of about 25 and 30 is where people
[18:54] peak in their Sport and um there is a
[18:58] little bit of Wiggle room there and it
[18:59] also depends on the sports so more
[19:01] explosive Sports people tend to Peak
[19:03] younger um the sports that require a
[19:06] little more skill and technique those
[19:08] people tend to Peak a little bit later
[19:11] in in their sport but again there's not
[19:13] much been done for sports um the
[19:16] evidence for Peak Performance in
[19:18] adolescence is based on adolescent
[19:20] athletes Elite adolescent athletes so it
[19:22] doesn't really apply again to in general
[19:25] a high school athlete or an adolescent
[19:27] athlete and that's the reference for
[19:29] that um paper down there I didn't have
[19:31] anything to do with that paper I just
[19:33] that was a very interesting paper that
[19:34] was part of this um particular
[19:37] Journey so I do want to mention here
[19:39] that there obviously is an effect of
[19:41] puberty on athletic performance
[19:43] individuals mature at different rates
[19:45] obviously you have a a a boy for example
[19:47] who at 14 when he's starting High School
[19:50] is you know 5 foot Zer and 100 pounds
[19:54] and then by the time he's a senior he's
[19:56] 6'1 170 that's a very different I mean
[19:59] that's that's of course obviously going
[20:01] to be a change in the way that that
[20:03] person might perform at a particular
[20:05] Sport and uh typically with women it's
[20:08] seen as a um seen as a detriment um to
[20:13] their sport performance they get hips
[20:16] they don't run as fast their body mass
[20:18] changes it's really hard for them to
[20:21] continue um in their sport at the same
[20:24] level at least that's where the myth of
[20:26] the sophomore Peak I think comes from I
[20:28] do want to mention the female triad here
[20:30] because I do think it's important and I
[20:32] don't want to gloss it over but my data
[20:34] does not have does not have any
[20:36] information on the female triad the
[20:38] female triad is this notion of low
[20:40] energy and U menstrual disturbance and
[20:43] also low bone and mineral density that
[20:45] tends to affect a large proportion
[20:47] according to this little graphic about
[20:49] 78% of female athletes so again it's an
[20:52] important issue but my data do not
[20:54] address that
[20:57] issue so my three questions are do boys
[21:00] and girls Peak and speed at different
[21:01] grades during High School um and is
[21:04] there any difference in those Peaks due
[21:05] to gender or interaction interaction
[21:07] between gender and their distance and in
[21:10] this particular paper I looked at 200
[21:11] meter 400 meter 800 meter and 1600 meter
[21:15] events and the one of the most common
[21:18] trajectories of finishing times for tra
[21:20] athletes across their High School
[21:21] careers this last question came later as
[21:24] I identified or started looking more
[21:26] closely at the data
[21:29] we had a ton of data for this if you
[21:31] didn't know track and field has a lot of
[21:34] websites where you can get data these
[21:36] are two a mil split and Tech and it's a
[21:40] mil split Texas in particular but it's
[21:41] mil split USA and there's a mil split
[21:43] Arizona and a milit Florida there's a
[21:46] bunch of different um mil splits and
[21:48] they have a lot of information um
[21:50] athletic.net in particular actually has
[21:52] the numbers on their website so they
[21:54] have over 85,000 coaches participating
[21:57] in this around 8 million entries per
[21:59] year and over 13,000 events so it is a
[22:03] ton of data waiting to
[22:06] be utilized for this and it goes from
[22:09] middle school all the way up to college
[22:12] in some instances it also uh is across
[22:15] the US and um across events there's a
[22:19] cross country as well as track and field
[22:21] it tracks the running events the
[22:23] throwing events the jumping events so
[22:24] it's it's all there and there's also
[22:27] ters which is for college
[22:29] as well I didn't utilize tiers in this
[22:30] particular study so we had to scrape
[22:33] these data so this is a snapshot of
[22:35] athletic.net in particular that's the
[22:37] one we wound up scraping um you can see
[22:39] that it's divided into regions this is
[22:41] Texas um region one to four there
[22:44] actually eight regions in Texas there's
[22:47] men's top athletes at the top women's
[22:49] performance list all those things you
[22:51] can get from there you can go drill down
[22:53] into a specific High School in a
[22:55] specific season and then you can find
[22:57] all of the athletes that are in that
[22:59] High School in that given season you can
[23:02] also look at the um particular race
[23:05] you're interested in or the event you're
[23:07] interested in men's 100 meters Varsity
[23:09] women's 100 meters Varsity for example
[23:11] drill on into that and get um rankings
[23:14] and other scores you can get scores per
[23:17] meet and all kinds of stuff from this so
[23:19] there's a lot of information here now
[23:22] scraping these data took the majority of
[23:25] the time obviously and the cleaning of
[23:27] it as well this was before for chat GPT
[23:29] could clean your data for you so we did
[23:32] all this um using my hand and a lot of
[23:35] regex expressions and rvest and a few
[23:39] CSE words thrown around mostly at the
[23:41] computer but anyway it was um it was
[23:45] that part was was difficult and we do
[23:47] have the data and I have the data that I
[23:49] used if you go to the website for the
[23:51] paper there's a link there to a GitHub
[23:53] site that has all of the data that I use
[23:55] for this in cleaned form by the way so
[23:59] um this is what we came up with what we
[24:01] wound up with for this paper we looked
[24:03] at athletes that completed four years in
[24:06] the same event and this is from 5A and
[24:09] 6A Texas high schools 5A and 6A schools
[24:11] in Texas are the largest high schools
[24:13] they have over 1500 students per class
[24:17] um and there are these are the numbers
[24:20] of the records I won't bother reading
[24:22] them for you you can read them
[24:23] yourselves we do have very few records
[24:26] for the 800 meter and again we had the
[24:28] stipulation that an athlete had to
[24:30] compete in all four years in that race
[24:32] and that's a very tough event so um
[24:35] that's probably why we have so few
[24:38] records in that one um and oh well I I
[24:43] just almost stole my own Thunder but let
[24:44] me let me go back to this um so we want
[24:48] to take these records and examine the
[24:50] sophomore Peak the idea being that if we
[24:54] examine change from year to year and
[24:57] look at the percentage of say personal
[25:00] records that an athlete that happen in
[25:03] each of these events from year to year
[25:05] then we should see the largest
[25:07] percentage of personal records in the
[25:09] sophomore year if the sophomore Peak is
[25:13] correct if it's
[25:15] true Dro please we don't see that okay
[25:20] what we see is so for every event and
[25:23] both genders we see that the percentage
[25:25] of personal records increases
[25:28] as the years go on and this tracks more
[25:31] with what we know about the data from
[25:33] Elite athletes and college athletes than
[25:37] uh previously because this is the um
[25:39] this kind of goes with that notion that
[25:42] people are still improving as they're
[25:44] staying with it and these athletes again
[25:47] are the oldest of them is probably 19
[25:50] years old so they have a long way to go
[25:52] hopefully to improve their craft a
[25:54] little bit more
[25:58] we also looked at means plus 95%
[26:01] confidence intervals for the percent
[26:02] change between grades and overall so in
[26:05] this particular graphic I have the
[26:07] overall is on the far right and you can
[26:09] see that the the vertical axis here are
[26:12] percent changes at zero Zero's up here
[26:15] at the top so a negative change
[26:17] indicates an increase in speed or a
[26:19] decrease in time however you want to
[26:21] look at it an improvement if you want to
[26:23] talk about it that way and we have from
[26:26] 9th to 10th 10th to 11th so the 10th to
[26:28] 11th would be the relevant one and you
[26:30] can see that athletes are still
[26:32] decreasing their speeds although perhaps
[26:35] not as quickly um and by the 11th and
[26:39] 12th there's a very little change in
[26:41] speed and O but overall you see there's
[26:43] obviously a big difference in their
[26:45] Improvement for both uh boys and girls
[26:48] in this the girls are in pink and the
[26:50] boys are in blue here on this
[26:53] one but this is for the group as a whole
[26:57] so this isn't
[26:58] average looking at every difference in
[27:01] grade as its own um value as its own um
[27:07] independently of the other grades I
[27:09] really wanted to look at what about
[27:11] trajectories so this doesn't connect
[27:14] individual athletes over time it just
[27:16] looks at them independently so I wanted
[27:18] to connect them over time and here I'm
[27:20] just going to look at the 1600 meter run
[27:23] as an example of what we did we did this
[27:25] for all four events that we looked at
[27:27] but this is the 16 100 meter run and um
[27:30] the vertical axes here are inverted so
[27:33] that uh better times are at the top and
[27:37] um there a boys on the right and girls
[27:40] on the left and you can see much much
[27:43] more variant for the girls um if you
[27:46] look at that solid red line in the
[27:48] middle that is the linear regression
[27:50] line that is done for all of these so
[27:52] you can kind of see what the average
[27:54] looks like note that that slope is
[27:55] mostly increasing or is increasing so
[27:58] that means an improvement overall in the
[28:00] high school trajectories um now the you
[28:03] see the the very light kind of grayish
[28:06] brownish shading in the back that's all
[28:08] of the athletes in the 1600 meter the
[28:11] darker brown lines are just 10 random
[28:13] that I picked out to show what typical
[28:16] trajectories might look at like look
[28:18] might look like and you can see that
[28:20] there is a lot of improvement but
[28:21] there's some that don't as well what you
[28:24] don't see is a distinct Peak at the
[28:27] sophomore year and then a plateau you
[28:29] might see kind of a more of a gradual
[28:31] shaping but for a lot of these athletes
[28:34] they are still getting better as they
[28:37] get out of their High School
[28:40] careers so looking at that all of those
[28:43] plots we've got we've got different
[28:45] slopes and different intercepts so I
[28:47] thought I'd do a mixed model analysis to
[28:49] see um if we could glean anything more
[28:53] from this to actually look at the effect
[28:55] of grade on them that's a fixed effect
[28:58] the grade squared which will quantify
[29:00] the peak so of course my time is in
[29:02] seconds we did this for each event and
[29:04] for both genders a separately so
[29:07] separate mix effect models and actually
[29:09] I have to say that this was an an idea
[29:11] from the reviewers that we did this so
[29:14] and and it turned out to be a really
[29:15] good thing actually so this is the model
[29:18] setup and then for the random intercept
[29:20] model I'm just going to look at 200
[29:22] meter and 1600 meter here and the
[29:25] coefficient as you note on the year for
[29:27] all of the is negative so we have girls
[29:30] and boys again analyzed separately um
[29:32] for both the 1600 meter and the uh 200
[29:35] meter we don't really see an Evidence of
[29:38] the peak that the year has a much larger
[29:40] T statistic than the year squared is
[29:42] more important and I actually did at one
[29:45] point take out the year squared and the
[29:47] um the remal statistic for this was
[29:50] actually a was a little bit larger
[29:52] without year squared but it was um not
[29:56] that much difference so you could take
[29:58] out that and still have roughly the same
[30:00] model so if you want to do parsimony you
[30:02] could say year squar is not really
[30:04] necessary for this um and but what's
[30:07] really remarkable about this is if you
[30:10] look at the interclass correlation
[30:12] coefficients they are enormous they're
[30:14] close to one what does that say that
[30:17] means the individual variability is
[30:19] really taking over in this model you and
[30:22] so in some sense the notion of trying to
[30:25] say that there's one Paradigm the
[30:27] sophomore Peak that fits all high school
[30:30] athletes is moot um because it's really
[30:34] more about individual
[30:38] variability um so we back to our 1600
[30:42] meter runs again so we wanted to ask
[30:45] fine we can't say anything about the
[30:47] sophomore Peak we can't really say
[30:48] anything about peak in general so what
[30:50] about clusters of athletes who perform
[30:52] similarly that's what we want to look at
[30:55] but we want to Cluster them over their
[30:57] trajectory so this is time series
[30:59] clustering and we're going to use the
[31:00] KLR package it's basically clustering
[31:03] with using K means for longitudinal data
[31:05] that's where K means longitudinal that's
[31:07] where that comes from it does not assume
[31:10] um a functional form of trajectories so
[31:13] um for example it doesn't assume a
[31:15] linear form so it's a non-parametric
[31:17] clustering and we chose our clusters via
[31:21] a cross validation for each event and
[31:23] each gender separately so I'm going to
[31:25] show you the results for the 200 meter
[31:27] boy boys and girls and the 1600 meter
[31:29] boys and girls so 200 meter is up here
[31:32] at the top and 1600 meter at the bottom
[31:35] boys on the left in red girls on the
[31:37] right in purple and these clusters so
[31:40] these lines each line represents a
[31:42] cluster of individuals within the um
[31:45] particular trajectories in their high
[31:47] school so now these these times on the
[31:49] vertical axis they're not inverted so
[31:51] performance at the bottom is better in
[31:54] this case um and you can see though what
[31:57] we do see is that athletes that stay
[31:59] that tend to start fast tend to stay
[32:01] fast um in the they're at least in the
[32:03] fastest group um they're not a whole lot
[32:06] of switching groups so as a college
[32:08] coach you might look at somebody who's
[32:10] like a boy in the uh 400 meter I'm sorry
[32:13] this is not 200 meter that's 400 meter
[32:15] on the top and you a 200 meter time of
[32:19] 60 seconds would be really bad
[32:22] um this is 400 meter so you see someone
[32:25] in this bottom line here that they have
[32:29] um 52 seconds as their start time and
[32:32] then they're down below 50 seconds by
[32:33] the time they're a senior that's a
[32:35] really good athlete of course as a coach
[32:37] you want to try to catch that person as
[32:39] early as possible so how do you figure
[32:41] out how do you predict that athletes is
[32:44] going to stay there or wind up in this
[32:47] group which has roughly the same
[32:48] intercept but a little bit different
[32:51] slope so that's another question to be
[32:54] answered later
[32:56] on so limitations takeaways this is
[32:59] always the thing that we need to think
[33:01] about um I don't really see evidence of
[33:04] a sophomore Peak maybe a junior Peak but
[33:06] and honestly these people are these
[33:09] athletes in general high school athletes
[33:10] seem to be improving over time which
[33:12] meshes more with the literature that we
[33:14] know about performance and human
[33:17] performance in general for running and
[33:19] throwing events um so this might be an
[33:22] opportunity to use some of these data to
[33:24] hold off and maximize scholarships I'm
[33:26] not saying that I I don't have an app or
[33:29] a shiny app or anything like that that a
[33:31] CO college coach could use yet to look
[33:33] at this um but maybe that's something
[33:35] for the future um some limitations we
[33:38] only used Texas and we only have gender
[33:41] well we have high school and region of
[33:44] the state as other variables but we
[33:47] don't have any other demographic
[33:48] variables for example their height or
[33:50] their weight or anything like that that
[33:52] we might be able to use to improve the
[33:54] model I suppose that we would get it but
[33:56] it would be at a lot of human effort to
[33:58] try to get that information and I
[34:00] mentioned here that Texas is the number
[34:02] two recruiting state for college track
[34:04] and field so it's the second most number
[34:06] of athletes from Texas that wind up in
[34:09] running in college at least in D1 anyone
[34:12] guess what number one is so audience
[34:14] participation time
[34:16] again no
[34:19] Georgia yeah Georgia's number one okay
[34:23] again sorry no fabulous prize for you
[34:25] but you just get to know that you won um
[34:27] so so um the other ones Florida is
[34:30] number three um and I believe this is
[34:32] going to surprise you Iowa and
[34:36] Pennsylvania okay so at least that's
[34:38] according to mil split a couple years
[34:39] ago maybe it's a little bit different
[34:41] now anyway um so for the future jumps
[34:46] and throws same girl here doing a triple
[34:48] jump so I'm very interested in the jumps
[34:51] and the throws as well and also doing
[34:54] this what I told you earlier about this
[34:56] idea of where we have
[34:58] backward analysis using record linkage
[35:00] so let's take the top college
[35:05] performers in that make champ that get
[35:08] championship rings or their they win
[35:11] their conferences and backtrack them
[35:13] through their High School career to see
[35:15] where they were and that's what we're
[35:17] working on right now hopefully we'll
[35:20] have something for you by JSM so um I'm
[35:23] going to leave it there but I do want to
[35:26] um mention a couple couple of things at
[35:28] SMU we have um some Physicians open and
[35:33] so I would love for you to join us at
[35:35] SMU statistics and data science come
[35:37] talk to me we have an open rank position
[35:40] a full Professor uh chair position indow
[35:44] chair position open and a lecture
[35:46] position also and this is our solar
[35:48] eclipse on Monday um taken from the
[35:51] Dallas Hall lawn right in front of SMU
[35:53] and that is peruna our fearsome mascot
[35:55] wearing his eclipse glasses and staying
[35:58] safe okay anyway thank you very
[36:07] much you want to answer some
[36:11] questions no time for
[36:21] questions um he is going to speak on
[36:24] using analytics to drivee
[36:34] absolutely Emily's Canadian but we're
[36:36] we're
[36:42] friends at least some
[36:53] yeah I'll just start talking while J
[36:55] sets up um
[36:57] oh yeah
[36:59] Mike
[37:02] thanks just clip this and hold
[37:17] it James can you hear me okay
[37:21] great
[37:23] um and the other is there any way we can
[37:25] get more chairs in the room and we have
[37:27] yeah yeah let's let's do that now while
[37:30] we set
[37:33] up and I'll just start talking a little
[37:35] bit to entertain everyone
[37:38] um thanks hi Lou nice to see you um
[38:00] but
[38:04] out like there's no
[38:08] so so there's no they already know they
[38:12] good they
[38:15] should that
[38:17] right well I mean those are means right
[38:20] so I didn't really have individual
[38:22] trajectories of athletes over that so
[38:23] it's it's possible that there might be
[38:25] someone who's in that smaller group that
[38:27] I mean things can happen but um yeah
[38:31] that I mean that that is possible I
[38:35] think I would want to do this set of
[38:36] analysis on more States and more data
[38:39] before I actually could make that
[38:41] recommendation but it does seem true
[38:43] that somebody who starts out running 400
[38:46] meters at 70 seconds is not going to be
[38:49] D1 qualifier by the time they're sa so
[38:52] that's something you can
[38:57] are we in business do folks have
[39:00] seats think we're
[39:02] good we're good okay all right
[39:07] great I think everyone's seated oh yeah
[39:10] the guys have seats all right thanks
[39:13] Monty all right um who's the schedule
[39:17] enforcer who's timing me yeah okay and
[39:21] what do I have 20 to talk and five for
[39:23] Q&A is that the idea yeah okay so can
[39:26] you time me for
[39:28] 22 minutes all right so all right so
[39:31] time me for 18 okay okay thank
[39:35] you um all right so I work at the US
[39:39] Olympic and Par Olympic Committee that
[39:41] is the the US organization that's
[39:43] responsible for fielding teams for the
[39:45] Olympics par Olympics um PanAm games and
[39:49] parapan games and we work with all of
[39:51] our national governing bodies across the
[39:53] country to field those teams so pick
[39:55] your favorite Olympic or par Olympic
[39:57] sports like the national governing
[39:58] bodies are like USA swimming USA
[40:01] Gymnastics USA fencing Etc okay um I
[40:06] work on a team called performance
[40:07] Innovation uh We've Come Together in the
[40:09] last few years so it's basically nerds
[40:12] are us it's um we are working in data
[40:16] analytics and Technology to support
[40:18] athlete Health wellness and performance
[40:20] that's our objective we have you can see
[40:23] a fancy purpose there lots of words you
[40:25] can read those later um strategically um
[40:29] you know we're trying to give
[40:30] competitive advantage to our Team USA
[40:32] athletes so our goal as an organization
[40:34] is to make sure that we are the best
[40:37] performance Innovation organization
[40:38] sorry Canada um when we host the Summer
[40:42] Olympics and Par Olympics in LA in
[40:45] 2028 um the three main pillars of our
[40:48] organization are the development of a
[40:52] platform called athlete 360 which is an
[40:55] athlete management system or am so if
[40:57] you ever hear AMS as a buzzword just
[41:00] think One-Stop shopping for all data
[41:02] that relates to an athlete and it's sort
[41:04] of a holy grail for for all
[41:06] organizations there are some commercial
[41:08] companies offering Solutions it's one
[41:11] it's the situation is kind of like it's
[41:14] for everyone which means it's sort of
[41:15] for no one because it's not customized
[41:17] for anybody but customization goes on
[41:20] and then but it's a big effort to create
[41:22] an AMS so we're working with an AMS
[41:25] partner to develop our system and then
[41:27] with customization for us and a lot of
[41:29] other organizations are doing the same
[41:31] thing um the other next pillar is
[41:33] international competitive analytics so
[41:36] thinking about what esan talked about
[41:37] this morning that's all about
[41:39] understanding how good are we compared
[41:41] to other countries so we have models for
[41:44] every Olympic event um and we basically
[41:48] look at the teams or the competitors in
[41:49] those events and what are their
[41:51] expectancies or likelihoods to win
[41:53] medals at the Olympics and we update
[41:55] those based on International competitive
[41:59] results and I'll talk about an aspect of
[42:01] competitive analytics that I'm involved
[42:03] with in my work here the final pillar is
[42:05] technology and Innovation so we operate
[42:07] a fund National governing bodies can
[42:10] apply for we also support them in
[42:12] executing those projects but it's
[42:13] basically extra funding to to do
[42:15] projects that relate to supporting
[42:18] athletes you know technique Health
[42:20] Wellness performance
[42:22] Etc uh some of the challenges uh and
[42:25] opportunities that we have in our
[42:28] Olympic and Paro Olympic movement in the
[42:30] US um is first one is resources so we
[42:34] are not like some countries that have a
[42:36] state sponsored Sports system money is
[42:39] tight and most ngbs are decentralized so
[42:42] we do not receive funding from the US
[42:44] government our funding comes from
[42:46] generous donors and from our television
[42:49] contract with NBC
[42:51] primarily so money is always at a
[42:53] premium we also have a smaller
[42:56] organization than you might have imagine
[42:58] um our national governing bodies have
[43:00] variable budgets and staff sizes so some
[43:02] of them like USA swimming or um USA
[43:07] Track and Field large organizations a
[43:10] lot of members relatively well funded
[43:13] and their staffs will include people
[43:15] working in the analytics and Technology
[43:18] spaces other ngbs are more like high
[43:22] school or small College Programs where
[43:25] there's a handful of people doing
[43:26] everything
[43:28] probably no one with any data analytics
[43:29] or technology capacity or capability so
[43:33] it's a real gamut of different you know
[43:36] capabilities and capacities that we that
[43:38] we support um there are many sports and
[43:41] events so in the Paris Olympics we have
[43:44] 329 metal events in 45 Sports so imagine
[43:49] like a whole bunch of World
[43:50] Championships going on all at the same
[43:52] time and then the par Olympics will have
[43:55] even more medal events uh in 23 Sports
[43:58] uh in Paralympics um they often change
[44:01] classifications so they classify
[44:03] athletes based on their limitations or
[44:07] capabilities in movement and those
[44:10] classifications are often changing so it
[44:12] makes data collection and analytics
[44:14] really challenging in that space and
[44:16] that's something that we're trying to
[44:17] overcome uh getting into Data now so
[44:20] like we heard eston talk about Hawkeye
[44:22] today um some of the other ones that the
[44:25] different major sports leagues have are
[44:26] like Z sport radar Etc second Spectrum
[44:30] we don't have any of that we don't have
[44:33] highres cameras or 19 high-rise cameras
[44:36] around our Arenas um we don't have easy
[44:40] means to do like ball tracking or
[44:43] realtime player tracking data so it's a
[44:45] space that we're trying to develop but
[44:47] it's a much harder effort for us we
[44:49] don't have what the major league major
[44:51] leagues have um another challenge is
[44:54] relatively few data points because many
[44:57] athletes in many sports don't compete
[44:58] all that
[45:00] often um we our data supplier is Grace
[45:03] note which used to be known as
[45:05] infast um they give us data I me to
[45:08] their credit on all Olympic sports but
[45:11] the nature of the data we have is what I
[45:12] would call like metadata it's basically
[45:15] athlete and team names what country they
[45:18] represent birth dates competition type
[45:21] the sport event who won who lost what
[45:23] was the rank what was the result if it's
[45:25] measurable that kind of stuff
[45:27] um competition results are often
[45:29] presented in a PDF format like I talked
[45:31] about with zun's great work um so we
[45:34] have to a lot of scraping and then
[45:36] finally video tagging which is really
[45:39] the the means that you would take to
[45:41] really understand like what goes into a
[45:43] performance is timec consuming expensive
[45:46] and subject to imperfect reliability so
[45:49] we're very interested in automated video
[45:51] tagging Solutions um that is
[45:53] surprisingly a much more difficult
[45:55] problem than I originally thought um and
[45:57] I think a lot of people underestimate
[46:00] how difficult that is to get it right
[46:02] that doesn't mean we're not
[46:04] trying um so the type of competitive
[46:07] analytics that we do or at least some
[46:08] examples here at the usopc and the data
[46:11] sources um one main type of analytics we
[46:13] do is Elo ratings who knows where ELO
[46:16] comes
[46:18] from T good job um so ELO comes from
[46:22] chess so it's basically a way of looking
[46:25] at head-to-head matchups and basic doing
[46:27] a point exchange so if someone beats
[46:30] somebody else they take ranking points
[46:32] from them and it's a way of
[46:33] understanding the relative strengths of
[46:35] different athletes in event we've taken
[46:37] that for head-to-head and adapted it for
[46:40] multi competitor events in order to
[46:43] understand an athlete or a team strength
[46:45] relative to other International
[46:47] competitors our initial data source is
[46:49] that Grace note that I talked about and
[46:52] we basically use that to calculate ELO
[46:54] ratings over time and then use that to
[46:57] calculate you know with a closed form
[46:59] expression how that translates to metal
[47:02] expectancy we also do some Monte Carlo
[47:04] simulation around that to figure it out
[47:06] so that's Row three we use MMI Carlo
[47:09] simulations around those ELO ratings to
[47:11] again estimate our metal
[47:13] expectancies another way we use those
[47:15] ELO ratings is for what we call
[47:16] Performance funnels so Monty I'm really
[47:19] interested in talk to you more because
[47:21] that basically relates to looking at how
[47:23] athletes progress over time and you know
[47:26] what their Peak age are and it's a
[47:28] really important tool for funding like
[47:31] understanding you know what someone when
[47:32] someone's Peak is likely to be I think
[47:35] we have a tendency to reward athletes
[47:36] for past performance and I think we see
[47:39] that in Major League Sports as well and
[47:42] I think it'd be interesting to flip that
[47:43] on its ear and find a way to look at
[47:46] athletes as they progress because once
[47:48] an athlete has won a gold medal they're
[47:50] going to get you know they're going to
[47:52] get sponsorships they're going to get
[47:53] resources they're going to have a lot of
[47:55] funding it's The Athlete on the way up
[47:58] who is unfunded or underfunded who we I
[48:01] think we should be supporting in order
[48:02] to help them maximize their potential so
[48:05] Monty really want to talk to you more
[48:06] about that because that's fascinating
[48:08] work um another aspect of M Carlo
[48:11] simulations and what I'm going to talk
[48:12] about today is instead of using ELO
[48:15] ratings to predict metal expectancies
[48:17] I've developed an approach to using
[48:19] competition results in order to
[48:22] basically run a bunch of my carless
[48:24] simulations and look at potential
[48:26] outcomes as well as what needs to be
[48:28] true for an athlete or a team to win in
[48:30] a given event and I'll illustrate that
[48:33] with an example from gymnastics today um
[48:35] if you're interested in seeing more I
[48:37] gave a similar presentation at the Sloan
[48:39] conference this year focused primarily
[48:41] on figure skating results so if you want
[48:44] to see that Shameless plug go to YouTube
[48:46] and you can find me um and then finally
[48:49] simple is Gap analysis part of
[48:51] understanding how we compare is just
[48:53] looking at different aspects of a
[48:55] performance and understand how our
[48:57] athletes compare to International
[48:59] competitors in each of those categories
[49:02] and that comes from utilizing data
[49:04] available in detailed results protocols
[49:07] so an example in figure skating might be
[49:09] comparing athletes on the points they're
[49:12] attaining from jump difficulty the
[49:14] points they're attaining from execution
[49:16] of quality on the spins points they're
[49:19] attaining from artistic marks all that
[49:21] kind of stuff you know wherever the data
[49:22] is available we're using it to to help
[49:24] our athletes understand where they have
[49:26] opportunity ities to to
[49:29] gain uh so the case study I'm going to
[49:31] show is from I mentioned gymnastics um
[49:34] I've been working a lot with the men's
[49:35] team in the last year and a half so our
[49:37] women have been doing great knocking out
[49:39] of the park they've won the team gold
[49:41] medal and a number of recent Olympics
[49:43] and World Championships um starting to
[49:45] work with them now and that opportunity
[49:47] was created by some of the work that
[49:49] we've had a chance to do with the men uh
[49:51] so the situation with the men at the
[49:53] 2023 World Championships was coming into
[49:57] that our men had not won a team medal at
[49:59] an Olympics or a world since
[50:02] 2014 um we did not so we did not win a
[50:05] medal at the 2022 World Championships
[50:08] that meant we lost an early opportunity
[50:10] to qualify our team um our big rival for
[50:13] that bronze medal was Great Britain and
[50:16] out of the six apparatus that the men
[50:18] compete on we only won one of those in
[50:21] the team event and we tied one um we
[50:25] lost both of the highest Leverage events
[50:27] and I'll talk about how I determine High
[50:29] leverage um and then in terms of
[50:32] difficulty we had more difficulty so
[50:34] gymnastic score very simple is basically
[50:36] difficulty Points Plus execution points
[50:39] difficulty is in theory uncapped but a
[50:41] really good difficulty score in a
[50:43] gymnastics routine is six points and
[50:47] execution is a maximum of 10 and the
[50:50] judges basically take deductions based
[50:52] on anything that's not perfect you won't
[50:54] see a 10 or at least right now you won't
[50:56] see a tend an execution anymore because
[50:59] the level of detail that the judges are
[51:01] scrutinizing with is extraordinary right
[51:03] now so a nine on execution is amazing
[51:07] and in a lot of apparatuses like eight
[51:09] and a half is also really good so in any
[51:12] case um difficulty we actually had a
[51:15] little bit more than half a point more
[51:17] than Great Britain in that competition
[51:19] we had more than eight points higher in
[51:21] difficulty than Italy which is a ton um
[51:24] and we were slightly behind China and a
[51:27] little over two points behind Japan um
[51:30] and that difficulty that was a that was
[51:31] a lot of progress over where we had been
[51:33] in Tokyo and going into that uh so there
[51:36] was big focus in US gymnastics on
[51:38] developing difficulty the problem was in
[51:42] 2022 um execution um the way you can
[51:46] often tell the result of a team
[51:48] competition in gymnastics is how many
[51:51] major and minor disasters the team had
[51:53] and I characterize a major disaster as
[51:56] an execution score less than six and a
[51:58] half and um a minor disaster as an
[52:02] execution score between six and a half
[52:04] and seven and a half and you can see in
[52:06] 2022 we had two of each Great Britain
[52:10] only had one major disaster and one
[52:12] minor and we finished a point and a half
[52:15] behind Great Britain and then the
[52:19] rubbing salt in the wound was losing to
[52:21] Italy as well despite Having Eight more
[52:23] points in difficulty and Italy
[52:27] was incredibly clean in the competition
[52:29] they went for Less difficulty but only
[52:31] had one major disaster in every other
[52:34] routine out of the 18 that count against
[52:37] the
[52:38] score they um they had an execution
[52:41] score of over eight which is amazing so
[52:44] we were asked several questions in 2023
[52:47] what were our chances of beating Great
[52:49] Britain how close was the competition
[52:51] likely to be was our strategy of
[52:54] focusing on difficulty and then
[52:55] improving EX ution working um what were
[52:58] the highest leverage events and then is
[53:01] live tracking of metal chances possible
[53:03] during a competition because in
[53:05] gymnastics it can be challenging because
[53:06] some events typically have higher scores
[53:08] than others and if different teams are
[53:11] on different apparatus at a given time
[53:13] it can be hard to know how a team is
[53:15] really doing so I came up with a way to
[53:18] track that during a competition in the
[53:21] way that you track win probability in
[53:23] like NFL as a game is going on so what I
[53:27] did was I looked at um the athletes that
[53:29] were going to be competing for Great
[53:31] Britain and USA it's five athletes the
[53:33] Team final is what they call three up
[53:35] three count so three compete all scores
[53:37] count the Team final score is just
[53:40] additive it's the sum of all um the
[53:42] scores that are achieved and then our
[53:45] chances according to my calculations go
[53:48] and I use data from the 2022 and 2023
[53:52] season and I used 10,000 L caros
[53:54] simulations to predict the win
[53:57] probability for each athlete I
[53:59] calculated their mean and standard
[54:01] deviation of score I assumed a normal
[54:03] distribution that's not perfect but I've
[54:06] done some exploration of different
[54:08] distributions and I haven't found
[54:09] anything that reliably works better so I
[54:12] stayed simple um and so we are three up
[54:16] three count and then going into the
[54:18] competition I had us at 58% likelihood
[54:21] to beat Great
[54:23] Britain um I also looked at so this is
[54:25] looking at the the total scores you know
[54:28] how close was the competition likely to
[54:30] be and I found that our mean going in
[54:32] was higher but we had higher standard
[54:34] deviation so higher
[54:37] variability and then how close was the
[54:39] competition likely to be you know I
[54:41] could predict you know to give the team
[54:43] a sense how close is it likely to be I
[54:45] said 61% likely that it was going to be
[54:48] less than three points which is
[54:49] relatively
[54:52] narrow um I I also looked at like so
[54:55] this is how I did determine the high
[54:56] leverage events I looked at in my sim my
[55:00] 10,000 simulations what happened in the
[55:02] scenarios where we won and what happened
[55:04] in the scenarios where we lost and
[55:06] looking at what breaking it down by each
[55:08] of the six events so it's um PB is
[55:11] parallel bars HB is high bar FX floor
[55:15] exercise Vault still Rings pom horse so
[55:18] the high leverage events were the most
[55:21] high leverage were floor exercise and
[55:23] vaults um but the other ones were
[55:25] relative ly
[55:28] close actual results our team won the
[55:31] bronze medal uh three of the five guys
[55:33] were first timers at Worlds so that was
[55:36] remarkable um we also won Fred M um Fred
[55:39] Richard won bronze in the individual
[55:41] allaround which hadn't happened in a
[55:43] long time and Coy young won two medals
[55:46] in the individual events which was
[55:48] amazing um so then looking at our team
[55:51] Finals results um you know looking in
[55:55] terms of major minor disasters our guys
[55:58] executed really well we only had one
[56:00] minor disaster um which was a lot better
[56:02] than Great Britain and Italy did and
[56:04] that's how we won the competition um our
[56:07] total score was up almost seven points
[56:10] and all of that came from execution so
[56:12] that was confirmation that our strategy
[56:14] of difficulty and then cleaning it up
[56:17] was working that was really promising um
[56:21] and yeah we won Let's see we won the
[56:24] three most likely events that we would
[56:25] win and then we were close on the other
[56:27] one so that's how we beat Great Britain
[56:30] by almost three
[56:32] points um this is the win probability
[56:35] graph so I talked about like just like
[56:36] in the NFL what I did was I adjust you
[56:39] know I basically took my model as each
[56:42] result was determined I put that into
[56:44] the model um as a determined result and
[56:48] then recalculated the win probability so
[56:50] you can see how that tracks over time
[56:53] even with us and Great Britain on
[56:55] different events at different different
[56:56] times so this gives us a chance of where
[56:58] we are and how different performances
[57:01] affect that win
[57:03] probability so it's all how an athlete
[57:05] performs relative to what's
[57:08] expected um several applications I think
[57:11] to other sports are possible you know
[57:13] pretty much any um any individual event
[57:17] whether there's a score or a result a
[57:20] distance a height Etc I think this can
[57:22] be applied it can also be used for
[57:24] relays where you're looking at the the
[57:26] sum of a bunch of variable inputs to
[57:29] determine a possible
[57:32] outcome and that's that thank you for
[57:35] tting
[57:38] me how long do I have for questions
[57:40] three seconds oh great Okay who wants to
[57:43] ask a three second question Quang you
[57:45] have five minutes that was 18 minutes oh
[57:47] perfect thank
[57:52] you analysis at comption level just
[57:57] between C in other words do you have a
[57:59] good track data within like those races
[58:01] ex swimming and like running
[58:05] Etc we just track based on the result in
[58:08] the competition so we're an athlete
[58:10] placed relative to all the other
[58:12] athletes so basically if I beat you I
[58:15] get points from you if you beat me you
[58:16] get points from me if you're the
[58:18] underdog and you beat someone who's the
[58:20] favorite you get more points than if
[58:22] you're the
[58:24] favorite and we just adjust based on
[58:26] every International competition for
[58:28] which we pull results
[58:31] in was there analysis Nicky of I imagine
[58:35] there's like an optim difficulty to
[58:37] execution like level and you mentioning
[58:39] that more difficult
[58:44] basally correct
[58:48] imagine is that decision that you
[58:53] guys yeah we've done a little bit what
[58:56] Nick asked about was basically the
[58:58] weighing difficulty versus execution and
[59:00] what's the right balance and that's
[59:01] actually one of the key things in my
[59:03] work um so I judge figure skating and so
[59:06] I work with a lot of the judge Sports
[59:09] all the way all these judge all these
[59:10] sports are judged or scored it's
[59:13] basically a risk reward balance so it's
[59:16] something we're working on Nick we're
[59:17] not there yet but it's definitely
[59:18] something we think about is how well can
[59:21] an athlete execute the amount of
[59:23] difficulty you know to achieve the
[59:25] highest maximum final score but what we
[59:28] found in Tokyo was we were so behind on
[59:30] difficulty that there was no hope of
[59:32] catching up and that's why the Mandate
[59:35] came to like do more difficult skills
[59:37] and then we'll get better at them and
[59:39] also Russia followed that formula in
[59:41] Tokyo and that helped them win so we we
[59:44] we took that Playbook and applied it
[59:47] yeah money so there's also this play
[59:50] between difficulty in exe
[59:54] div so thing we're looking at as well
[59:57] we're not there yet but it's sort of a
[59:59] similar story I mean the the points are
[60:01] calculated somewhat differently and
[60:03] Diving the dip G of difficulty is
[60:05] multiplied by the execution score as
[60:07] opposed to added so that changes things
[60:09] a little bit as Greg helped us
[60:11] understand um but it's something I mean
[60:14] we're looking at it in all of our judge
[60:15] sports like artistic swimming just
[60:18] implemented a system very much like
[60:20] these other sports last year they moved
[60:22] from holistic marking to a point system
[60:26] and just based on the way it was
[60:27] initially set up we found that you
[60:30] basically had to max out on difficulty
[60:32] to be competitive so our coaches bravely
[60:34] did that and that basically took us from
[60:37] not qualifying for the last Olympics and
[60:39] not qualifying for the last several into
[60:42] a metal Contender for this coming
[60:44] Olympics um but artistic swimming and
[60:46] I'm actually part of a consultancy group
[60:48] that's looking at it is actually looking
[60:50] at adjusting the different point values
[60:53] in order to restore some of the Artistry
[60:55] to itic
[60:58] swimming yeah what's your first name oh
[61:00] Rosie
[61:09] hi that's a great question I don't know
[61:12] the answer like all this ELO stuff was
[61:14] developed by a colleague of mine named
[61:16] Dan Webb working together with Professor
[61:18] Mark lickman at Harvard and some of his
[61:20] students so I don't know if they tried a
[61:23] true skill rating or not or I know
[61:25] they've tried gcko because of Mark
[61:27] lickman and some of that work has come
[61:30] into our method of doing like multi-c
[61:33] competitor events you know which is an
[61:35] adaptation of the head-to-head but I
[61:37] don't know if we tried true skill yeah
[61:40] it's a good question I'll look into
[61:43] that Sean yeah um I was curious when
[61:46] you're talking about the high leverage
[61:48] events do you also take into account
[61:50] like we kind of just looked at the
[61:52] example of Great Britain head-to-head
[61:53] but yeah you know in the Olympics
[61:55] obviously lot more countries a bronze
[61:58] position do we take those other
[62:00] countries into account or would it be
[62:02] difficult to do so I mean it's possible
[62:04] I was trying to make the problem as
[62:06] simple as possible because based on all
[62:08] previous data like it was very clear
[62:10] that we weren't going to be beating
[62:11] Japan or China on any day and the teams
[62:15] below us were very like very unlikely to
[62:18] beat us so I focus on the Great Britain
[62:20] head-to-head but you know I mean going
[62:23] into into the games now in Paris you
[62:26] know I'll look at who I think is close
[62:27] and that's what I'll Focus my analysis
[62:29] on but we're also developing a tool that
[62:31] will enable us to do this a lot more
[62:34] automatically than the horribly
[62:36] embarrassing manual way that I'm doing
[62:38] it
[62:39] now yeah good question Sean do you think
[62:43] there was a was there a difference or
[62:45] like different strategy employed for
[62:48] optimizing for a team and that
[62:50] head-to-head match up versus optimizing
[62:52] for like highest total team score was
[62:54] there a difference um in like the way
[62:57] that you form the team yeah it's a good
[62:59] question I mean in gymnastics you
[63:02] know it's an additive score so again
[63:04] it's it's three routines on each
[63:05] apparatus so it's 18 scores that count
[63:08] um it doesn't matter where you get your
[63:10] points like every point is equal whether
[63:12] you regardless of which apparatus or
[63:15] whether it comes from difficulty or
[63:16] execution so the team is selected based
[63:19] on who can produce the highest score
[63:21] like we're we're not selecting the team
[63:22] based on a consideration of other
[63:24] countries but when we are you know
[63:26] coaching our athletes developing our
[63:28] athletes we're certainly looking at
[63:29] what's going on out there and seeing
[63:32] what it takes for us to be competitive
[63:33] but once it gets to the point we're at
[63:35] US championships or Olympic trials it's
[63:38] only about our athletes and what can
[63:39] maximize our
[63:42] score Augustus like events and all
[63:46] around scores like are you trying to
[63:48] maximize for a medals achieved in events
[63:51] and like does that do underleveraged
[63:53] events tend to be like
[63:57] yeah it's a great question so Augustus
[63:58] asked basically that was the essence of
[64:00] the data challenge
[64:02] so so the the data challenge is all
[64:05] about like so gymnastics has in the
[64:07] men's there are eight different metal
[64:09] events the women have six right it's
[64:11] team individual allaround and then all
[64:13] the individual events we've historically
[64:17] I'll say overemphasized the team medal
[64:19] and optimized for that and I've said to
[64:22] anyone who will listen like that's one
[64:24] medal and and especially in a case like
[64:27] Tokyo where we were never going to beat
[64:29] China Japan or Russia in the Team final
[64:32] we should have selected a bunch of guys
[64:33] who could make the individual event
[64:35] finals um now that we've won the team
[64:38] medal at the last World Championships I
[64:41] think the team medal has resurfaced as a
[64:43] very important possibility for us but
[64:46] that was a big question that I wanted
[64:48] the folks during the data challenge to
[64:50] answer for us was how do we maximize for
[64:52] total medals as opposed to for just the
[64:54] team
[64:56] yeah so go to the poster session today
[64:58] great work was
[65:00] done I'm done I'm done yes I'm done
[65:05] thank you
[65:09] everybody as I said earlier come talk to
[65:22] me and he's going to talk about
[65:24] optimizing
[65:31] yeah here you
[65:39] go yes okay thank
[65:47] you does this work for the mic okay cool
[65:52] awesome and then just put yeah click
[65:55] anywhere okay awesome thank you
[65:57] appreciate it okay cool awesome thank
[66:00] you for the intro um hi everyone my name
[66:02] is Lulu uh so for context this is a
[66:05] swimming project that I did senior year
[66:07] of undergrad I already graduated but um
[66:09] senior year of undergrad with in
[66:10] collaboration with Professor Brian
[66:12] McDonald and Dr Elliot Schwarz um for
[66:14] content for background I grew up
[66:16] swimming was very bad at it
[66:18] unfortunately but so this project was
[66:20] really exciting to me because it's a
[66:21] combination of not having to swim but
[66:24] being involved in the swim world
[66:26] uh so super excited to be here today
[66:27] thank you for
[66:29] coming so starting with the back some
[66:31] background on the leftand side um as you
[66:34] may know the US has some of the world's
[66:35] best individual swimmers Michael Phelps
[66:37] Caleb drussell many many gold medals
[66:39] unfortunately in the 2021 Tokyo Summer
[66:42] Olympics um we Team USA actually plays
[66:45] fifth in the 4X 100 mixed medley relay
[66:48] the mixed medley relay is a newer swim
[66:50] event so not a lot of data out there um
[66:52] for this event but essentially involves
[66:54] two men two women
[66:56] um back breast fly free 100 meters of
[66:58] each stroke um and the interesting part
[67:00] of this race is you get to pick which
[67:02] combination you want to swim so there's
[67:04] lots of possibilities um different
[67:05] countries do different things we placed
[67:07] fifth um everyone thought we were going
[67:08] to do really well so this was very sad
[67:11] news and that is kind of the um
[67:14] motivation for my project what is then
[67:16] the optimal lineup strategy for the 4X
[67:19] 100 mixed medley relay um specifically
[67:21] who are the two men and two women who
[67:23] should swim it and which order
[67:29] so to answer this question um two main
[67:31] data sets that we looked at here the
[67:33] first one Olympic swimming data provided
[67:35] by Elliot thank you um so this was my
[67:38] definitely my main data set uh it spans
[67:41] 3,000 swimmers nearly 3,000 swimmers
[67:43] across the 8 100 meter individual leg so
[67:46] this is not really data just individual
[67:48] swims um four men's for women's back
[67:50] breast fly free we looked at the data
[67:53] specifically for swimmers who swam in
[67:56] 2021 or later the rationale here is if
[67:59] you're a competitive swimmer and you're
[68:00] very good you're going to the Olympics
[68:02] if you didn't swim in the 2021 Olympics
[68:04] or in 2021 at all you're probably not
[68:07] unfortunately going to compete in the
[68:08] 2024 Olympics so just basically
[68:10] subsetting it to the swimmers who are
[68:12] most relevant um and then also if you
[68:14] only had one swim time throughout the
[68:16] six years you're also probably not going
[68:18] to go to the 2024 Olympics um and as
[68:20] predicted the swimmers who only had one
[68:22] time did have slower times compared to
[68:24] the rest of the group so basically this
[68:26] is just taking the swimmers that are
[68:27] most likely actually going to the 2024
[68:29] Olympics the second data set here very
[68:32] very small but um essentially we scraped
[68:35] some The Limited mixed medly relay data
[68:37] that we did have from um the various
[68:39] most recent World Champs um that did
[68:42] actually do the mixed medley so very
[68:44] very small data set definitely this was
[68:45] the main thing one more thing to note um
[68:48] it says 2022 but actually did this
[68:50] project in first half of 2022 so most of
[68:53] the data is up until 2021
[68:59] so now I just wanted to go through some
[69:00] of the preliminary trends that we found
[69:03] in the data um so starting on the
[69:05] leftand side here this is a graph
[69:07] looking at summer age and then average
[69:09] summer time in this case we're looking
[69:11] at Women's 100 free but the same Trends
[69:13] apply to all of the events that we see
[69:15] here so this is basically showing as you
[69:18] know assumed there is an age curve in
[69:20] swimming like many other sports where um
[69:23] swimmers tend to get faster up until a
[69:24] certain age and then they either get
[69:26] slower or likely retire um so that's
[69:28] just confirming that there is that
[69:30] happening here as well on the right hand
[69:33] side we have um the session description
[69:35] so whether it was a prelim a semi or a
[69:38] final the swim was one of those and then
[69:40] once again the average swim time what
[69:42] this is saying is finals um swimmers in
[69:45] final sessions tend to swim faster than
[69:48] prelims which makes sense they try
[69:49] harder it's the finals the semi- one is
[69:51] a little bit surprising um I would not
[69:53] read too much into this we had very
[69:55] little data for the semi-finals so this
[69:57] is likely just like a faster subset of
[70:00] the data but definitely way more data
[70:02] for prelim and finals um and the trend
[70:04] makes sense for these
[70:09] two so moving on here on the left hand
[70:12] side we have the meat type um we
[70:14] categorize meat type as either an
[70:16] Olympic trial an Olympic game A world
[70:18] championship or anything else um so in
[70:21] this case what this is showing us is
[70:23] swimmers tend to swim faster and Olympic
[70:25] Games and World Championships rather
[70:27] than trials or literally any other meet
[70:29] um which makes sense the Olympic trials
[70:31] and World Champs are iconic very Global
[70:33] swim events um so it makes sense that
[70:35] they would swim faster there on the
[70:37] right hand side this is using the very
[70:39] limited relay data that we had it
[70:41] essentially just looks at the swims that
[70:43] were part of the mixed medley relay
[70:45] versus an individual swim and this trend
[70:48] might be surprising because it shows
[70:49] that a relay swim is you know decently
[70:51] faster than a individual leg this was
[70:54] only like maybe 20 days points so not
[70:56] again not probably super representative
[70:59] it is true though that some swimmers and
[71:00] relays can swim faster it is a really
[71:02] Dynamic um so it's it's probably the
[71:05] difference though is probably not this
[71:07] egregious in real
[71:11] swims cool so the last graph here is
[71:14] looking at the swim meet year over time
[71:16] and then the average swim time this one
[71:18] I found interesting because at least on
[71:20] the news I tend to see articles of um
[71:23] new swimmers like breaking records very
[71:25] frequently um in the individual swims
[71:28] what this is saying is while there may
[71:29] be these like unicorns um overall as a
[71:33] whole um these swimmers tend to remain
[71:36] pretty steady over time year over year
[71:38] with the exception of when covid hit so
[71:41] in 2020 um beginning you know coish um
[71:44] so I think that cohort are the people
[71:46] who were already really good swimmers so
[71:49] they probably had more access to pools
[71:50] so you do see the average time
[71:52] decreasing a little bit um and there
[71:54] aren't as many swims in 2020 either and
[71:56] then in 2021 when there's more recovery
[71:59] we see the swimmers may be readjusting
[72:01] to postco swims so it goes up a little
[72:03] bit and then 2022 we didn't have much
[72:05] data so we not count that too much but
[72:07] essentially the story here is actually
[72:09] stays pretty steady over time the
[72:11] average
[72:14] times so the next few slides here are
[72:17] walking through how we essentially took
[72:19] all that data all those Trends to answer
[72:21] the question posed at the beginning what
[72:23] is the optimal relay line strategy so
[72:26] the first thing we did here is build a
[72:28] model so we fit a linear regression
[72:30] model for each event and gender
[72:32] combination so eight models total eight
[72:34] events um and as for the model itself
[72:38] these are some of the details so as seen
[72:40] from the slides the outcome variable
[72:42] that we really want to predict here is a
[72:43] swim time for a swimmer and then these
[72:46] are the various um predictor variables
[72:48] that we did have I won't go over them
[72:49] since we just went over them and in the
[72:51] slides but the only additional one is
[72:54] the unique swimmer ID so we can account
[72:55] for swimmer to swimmer differences since
[72:57] some swimmers are just faster overall
[72:59] than others so this was a model we used
[73:03] um and then going back to the
[73:04] methodology here um so once we have a
[73:06] mod for every event in every J every J
[73:09] combo um then we predicted swim times
[73:11] for each swimmer under specific
[73:14] conditions that we designated and these
[73:16] conditions are either 2021 or 2024
[73:18] Olympics it had to be a final race um a
[73:22] relay and then the swimmer's age so
[73:25] built the model and then fed the model
[73:27] all these conditions to get the
[73:28] predicted swim times the second box line
[73:32] here is basically us using the model to
[73:34] then simulate individual swims so we
[73:37] constructed normal distributions for
[73:39] each swimmer and event using the models
[73:41] um mean and standard deviation of the
[73:43] predicted times and then we simulated
[73:46] each event using this um so basically
[73:49] it's like each swimmer swam their race a
[73:51] thousand times and so because we have
[73:53] these a thousand simulations
[73:55] we can then rank them over their
[73:57] thousand simulations by taking the
[73:58] average so then for each event we have
[74:01] basically one to however many Summers
[74:03] there are they ranking
[74:08] overall so this is an example um of I
[74:11] think this is women's
[74:13] 1003 uh so we have each swimmer and
[74:17] there are many more swimmers and this is
[74:18] just the top 20ish maybe and then the
[74:21] average time overall is basically their
[74:22] average of the a thousand simulated
[74:24] swims
[74:26] and then last column the
[74:29] rape so basically that allows us to find
[74:32] the fastest swimmers in every single
[74:34] event then next two boxes here really
[74:37] have to do with the relays so now that
[74:40] we have the fastest swimmers we took the
[74:41] top five from each country for each of
[74:43] the eight events and then constructed
[74:45] all possible relay combinations that we
[74:48] could using the top five swimmers the
[74:49] only two real criteria we have here are
[74:52] the swimmers can't repeat as the rules
[74:54] of the mix medly relay and then it has
[74:56] to be two men and two women but other
[74:58] than that all combinations are on the
[75:00] table using the top five stores the top
[75:02] five is just because my laptop couldn't
[75:03] handle more than that so had to restrict
[75:06] it um and then finally um we can now
[75:10] calculate the relay sets by looking at
[75:12] the individual legs so the average relay
[75:14] time then is just the sum of the
[75:16] individual leg averages and then the
[75:18] variance since they're independent
[75:20] swimmers are just the sum of the
[75:22] individual leg variances as well so then
[75:25] using the relay average and relay
[75:27] variance we can then rank the relay
[75:29] combinations based on their summed
[75:35] average so then the last step here is
[75:37] just really looking at now relay
[75:39] simulations we've built all relay
[75:40] combinations we have the predicted
[75:42] averages now we can simulate them so we
[75:45] took the fastest relay combination from
[75:47] every country based on the averages and
[75:49] then all possible us combinations
[75:51] because we care the most about the US in
[75:52] this case um and then simul each relay
[75:55] combination a thousand times based on
[75:57] the stats we just
[75:59] calculated so after we do that you can
[76:01] then calculate each relay combinations
[76:03] probability of winning first to 16th
[76:06] Place based on the number of times that
[76:08] each combination plac that rank the
[76:11] around the 10 thousand simulations um so
[76:14] I know that's a lot I think the most the
[76:16] more interesting part is the actual
[76:18] results so we built the um results of
[76:21] these simulations in kind of a four
[76:23] parter in an application
[76:25] the first section here um so this is the
[76:28] actual mixed medley relay in the 2021
[76:31] Tokyo Olympics so the L most column has
[76:33] a country and then the next series are
[76:36] kind of like the swimmers so back
[76:38] swimmer the name and then the actual
[76:40] Back Time is what they actually swam at
[76:41] the Olympics the simulated Back Time is
[76:44] what our model predicted um after the
[76:47] simulations and then yeah and then it
[76:49] goes breast fly free so the actual total
[76:54] relay time is the actual results of
[76:56] these eight countries and then the
[76:59] simulated average to relay time is our
[77:01] simulated times the actual rank is what
[77:04] they actually place so you see the US in
[77:06] fifth place and then we'll start with
[77:08] the last column here the simulated rank
[77:10] overall this is basically because we had
[77:13] all the combinations um and we ranked
[77:15] them this is essentially how that
[77:17] specific combination placed in
[77:19] comparison to all the simulated
[77:21] combinations so the higher the number
[77:23] like the worse they did in our pred
[77:25] the lower the lower the number the
[77:27] better they did in our predictions um so
[77:29] you can see our model isn't perfect like
[77:31] for example Great Britain placed first
[77:33] and we originally thought them to be um
[77:36] do worse than that China um we thought
[77:39] China would win but in general you see
[77:41] that the teams that placed worse tend to
[77:44] have higher numbers and the teams that
[77:46] placed better tend to have lower numbers
[77:48] so directionally um it is validating it
[77:51] what's most interesting here is the
[77:52] simulated rank within country column
[77:55] what this is saying is um comparing how
[77:58] each combination did in comparison to
[78:01] that country's combinations so most of
[78:03] the numbers are really low here
[78:04] indicating that most countries use their
[78:06] top even one to like top five
[78:09] combinations what stands out is the US
[78:11] according to our um predictions used
[78:13] their 61st fastest combination so a lot
[78:17] of people like China and can't see Italy
[78:20] used their top combination um and they
[78:23] did well and the U uh the did not
[78:26] Australia um people also thought
[78:28] Australia would Place pretty well and we
[78:30] see that they use their 13th fastest
[78:32] combination according to our culations
[78:34] sorry oh oh God it faster okay 13
[78:38] fastest combination so I think this just
[78:40] shows that we did not use our most
[78:42] optimal combination
[78:45] here cool so this second slide looks at
[78:49] the top 10 fastest relay combinations
[78:52] per country so if we didn't use our best
[78:54] combination what would be our best
[78:56] combination this um you can in a little
[78:58] clicker at the top here basically you
[78:59] can select any country that you're
[79:01] interested in and it'll spit out the top
[79:03] 10 fastest combinations um in this case
[79:06] I won't read out the names but number
[79:07] one there would be our um top
[79:09] combination I will copy up that this
[79:11] whole project in general relies heavily
[79:14] on historical data um so since we only
[79:16] have historical data up until really
[79:17] 2021 if I were to redo this project
[79:19] using you know 2022 2023 data I
[79:22] definitely think a lot of these names
[79:23] would change so I won't stand by these
[79:26] names but I'll stand by the general
[79:28] methodology um so these would basically
[79:30] be our top 10 what's interesting here is
[79:33] this is the top 10 within our country
[79:35] and then these are the ranks overall
[79:37] essentially this is saying because these
[79:39] two columns are the same um it's saying
[79:40] that like if we had used any of our top
[79:43] 10 fastest US combinations we basically
[79:45] would have won overall um but we used
[79:48] our 61 so we did not
[79:52] win and then this slide looks at
[79:55] basically a race of the most elite or
[79:57] the fastest so takes every country's
[79:59] fastest relay combination and then races
[80:01] them we only have like the top eight
[80:03] maybe 10 here uh but if we had raced our
[80:06] fastest combination every other country
[80:08] had raced their fastest combination we
[80:10] still would have likely
[80:16] won and then finally um this is probably
[80:19] the most interesting tool so I think
[80:21] it's really great to have the predicted
[80:23] fastest relay combination for every
[80:25] country but unfortunately sometimes
[80:27] you're just not able to race those
[80:28] specific swimmers due to health reasons
[80:30] maybe there's a scheduling reason um so
[80:32] what this tool does is you can
[80:34] essentially select a swimmer um this is
[80:37] for the US only but you can select a
[80:38] swimmer from each stroke so back bre fly
[80:40] free and then simulate how well that
[80:43] combination would have done against all
[80:45] other Count's fastest combination so in
[80:48] this case I think I picked a random
[80:49] combination we would not have done as
[80:51] well I think we would have placed
[80:52] seventh in this case um compared to to
[80:54] every other country's fastest
[80:55] combination this is probably the most
[80:57] helpful tool um because just having the
[80:59] fastest combination can only do so much
[81:02] this is a more like flexible um and
[81:04] versatile tool so this is the thing I
[81:06] think biggest takeaway from this but
[81:08] again it really relies on historical
[81:10] data um and we don't have the most
[81:11] recent historical
[81:13] data yeah
[81:16] okay okay cool okay I'm done um yeah but
[81:20] thank you yeah that's that's it um I
[81:22] want to thank Elliot and again for
[81:25] helping me this project um yeah take any
[81:31] questions so maybe I'm missing something
[81:33] but I didn't really get why doing it
[81:36] like M so you're fitting a normal
[81:37] distribution using the like the aage yes
[81:40] so the simulated data also like will
[81:43] preserve the other magnitude on like
[81:46] alongside of those BR yeah why would we
[81:48] really need uh the Monte simulation
[81:51] instead we could do a constraint
[81:52] optimization linear optimization problem
[81:54] or like
[81:55] the aage and choose the best like sub
[81:58] that like minimize the time yeah you're
[82:00] saying why do we even need to like
[82:01] simulate and and just use like the
[82:03] linear regression yeah that's a good
[82:05] point I
[82:06] think so essentially here like swimming
[82:09] seems to have like a little bit more
[82:11] well okay I'll start with this if you
[82:13] just use the linear regression model um
[82:15] the results aren't as accurate because
[82:17] in general especially with relays
[82:18] there's a lot more variance potentially
[82:21] it's individual swimmers and depending
[82:23] on reaction times I think there's a lot
[82:24] more change in the potential outcomes so
[82:26] the simulations was designed to
[82:28] hopefully capture more of that
[82:29] variability and change rather than just
[82:31] relying on one answer from a model um
[82:34] it's a good question but yes so once we
[82:36] found that we simulated more the results
[82:39] that we were trying to predict came
[82:40] closer to the actual 2021 Tokyo Olympic
[82:43] Results rather than relying on just the
[82:48] model I think I was thinking the same
[82:51] thing about like you want this
[82:53] variability would you recommend you have
[82:55] a team that is pretty good on average
[82:58] but has really low variability yeah or
[83:00] would you rather have a really fast team
[83:01] that has really high variability where
[83:03] it's like you could win and fastest yeah
[83:06] or you could just be the worst right
[83:07] right that's a good question I think
[83:08] that's why we tried to incorporate the
[83:10] probabilities more we actually went up
[83:12] all the way to 16th Place um so I guess
[83:15] in combinations where you see the
[83:16] probability of ranking first because it
[83:18] takes into account the variance in
[83:20] calculating that if that's really high
[83:22] then maybe you have more confidence in
[83:23] that combination if if the probably
[83:26] ranking first and second or third are
[83:28] very close to each other then maybe it's
[83:29] not as confident of a call
[83:34] um noticed on your slide you had the USA
[83:37] teams that the freestyle swimmer was the
[83:41] same
[83:43] yes
[83:45] yeah yes yeah I know um actually I think
[83:49] it's interesting because the US did um
[83:52] the the US actually did really well in a
[83:54] some recent mixed medle relay so we've
[83:56] clearly redeemed ourselves um the
[83:58] swimmers that they I think I did check
[83:59] the swimmers they used uh they were
[84:02] younger swimmers and they did place they
[84:04] were some of the fastest swimmers they
[84:05] weren't included in here because at the
[84:07] time their swim times weren't as fast um
[84:09] but I agree like I think it clearly
[84:11] shows that she's she's very
[84:15] talented yes you have any
[84:18] recommendations for like if you were a
[84:19] worse country I mean I
[84:22] get T USA so you probably would
[84:25] like if you were a worst country and you
[84:26] like the only way they could metal would
[84:28] be like some combination of swimmers
[84:30] that's like has a really high
[84:31] variability and they need like basically
[84:32] a miracle to happen yeah
[84:35] like what would your like
[84:37] recommendation s I'm American so yeah no
[84:40] know I mean I think if you're I think if
[84:43] you're already
[84:44] swimming I think if you're already
[84:45] swimming poorly you don't have like that
[84:47] much to lose so you might as well try
[84:49] the predicted fastest combination even
[84:51] if it doesn't let you wi because I guess
[84:53] if you're approach is playing the safer
[84:56] swimmers that have lower variants but
[84:57] score worse it's not working so far so
[85:00] you might as well try something more
[85:02] wild um but luckily we're the US so
[85:06] don't have that
[85:07] problem thank you
