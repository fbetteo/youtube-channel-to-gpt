[02:31] to thank and that's uh the authors of of
[02:34] the posters um they were
[02:36] uh impressive progressively high quality
[02:38] um and it's everyone absolutely uh who
[02:40] submitted deserves a big round of
[02:42] applause that's just like sarah was
[02:44] saying that putting yourself out there
[02:46] whether it's just on twitter or a blog
[02:49] or or an actual conference or workshop
[02:51] submission is a great and in some way in
[02:55] some sense the only way of of really
[02:56] getting your name out there if this is
[02:58] something that you think you might want
[02:59] to do
[03:00] so congratulations to everyone who
[03:02] submitted um you all did did impressive
[03:04] impressive work
[03:06] um
[03:06] and secondly i would like to uh share
[03:08] our my thanks personal thanks to the uh
[03:10] voting panel um who put in a fair amount
[03:12] of work to uh to get to where we are now
[03:15] so i um
[03:17] wanted to start with some sort of uh
[03:19] general concepts or general ideas about
[03:21] what we thought about the posters um
[03:23] other than being really impressed by the
[03:25] technical uh merit of the posters it was
[03:28] really really awesome to see uh such a
[03:30] diversity in sports uh um and i mean
[03:34] like in the sports they chose to
[03:36] actually cover flat track derby wnba
[03:39] climbing chess beach volleyball which
[03:42] near near my heart um
[03:44] it was great to see uh uh sports
[03:46] represented in from uh you know non
[03:49] non-traditional american sports um
[03:51] that were not non-traditional american
[03:53] sports so that's really awesome and um
[03:56] on a more practical note um for those of
[03:58] you who maybe are thinking about
[03:59] submitting or or or this seems you know
[04:02] potentially really interesting to you um
[04:05] sports that are not necessarily
[04:06] traditional popular american sports are
[04:08] a great opportunity to get a foot in the
[04:10] door specifically because there might be
[04:12] more
[04:13] you know i would call it low-hanging
[04:14] fruit but there might be things that
[04:16] have not been explored and you have a
[04:17] chance to make a real impact and um as i
[04:21] assume you know numerous speakers have
[04:22] said before uh oftentimes these are
[04:25] transferable between sports so try not
[04:27] to stay if you're interested in this um
[04:28] there's a lot of opportunity for a lot
[04:30] of really great sports that absolutely
[04:32] deserve um a little more exposure and
[04:34] there's a chance to really make an
[04:36] impact doing that so that's great second
[04:38] thing i want to comment on was uh it was
[04:40] really great to see uh collaborations
[04:42] between universities and institutions
[04:45] and i think in a few cases countries and
[04:48] uh
[04:49] you know one thing that uh sarah
[04:51] mentioned just a few seconds ago was
[04:54] reaching out to people and
[04:56] you know
[04:57] one thing i love about the sports
[04:58] community is everyone seems very open
[05:01] and amenable to collaboration so if you
[05:02] have an idea um reach out to someone
[05:06] that you think might be relevant to that
[05:07] even if it's only on twitter and and you
[05:09] know i don't know anyone personally that
[05:11] is that is that is not willing to spend
[05:13] a little time uh exploring really
[05:15] interesting ideas so that's where it all
[05:16] starts
[05:18] okay
[05:19] let's talk about a few posters that we
[05:21] uh the panel specifically wanted to call
[05:23] out for having some really really great
[05:25] qualities um first is uh racism and
[05:28] officiating in women's flat track derby
[05:30] association um
[05:32] was really interesting for covering a
[05:35] topic that is not necessarily sort of on
[05:37] court on field and that's another
[05:39] opportunity to really make an impact is
[05:41] to talk about things that are related to
[05:43] sports but not necessarily related to
[05:45] win probability or draft metrics or
[05:47] anything that you might consider
[05:48] traditional so that was really
[05:49] interesting to the panel
[05:51] um secondly um
[05:53] how much luck is involved in getting a
[05:55] hit of study using decision trees and
[05:57] random force to understand the factors
[05:59] influencing batting average on balls in
[06:01] play um the panel thought that was a
[06:04] really great really interesting and
[06:05] broadly applicable um
[06:08] question and
[06:09] potentially a great sort of first step
[06:11] in solving that
[06:12] and um
[06:14] expert elicitation what information do
[06:16] mock drafts provide about the actual nba
[06:18] draft and rule change is affecting uh
[06:21] extra inning game length in the pioneer
[06:23] baseball league
[06:24] the panel really thought those two
[06:26] posters did a really excellent job in
[06:29] framing the discussion of their problem
[06:31] which uh as i'm sure you've heard in a
[06:33] number of different ways throughout the
[06:34] day is in some sense the most important
[06:36] part of all of this uh so if you're out
[06:38] there thinking about presenting
[06:40] something or submitting something maybe
[06:41] next year or to a different
[06:43] conference or workshop um
[06:45] the criteria this year was really
[06:46] focused on how do you properly explain
[06:50] the motivation to your problem how do
[06:51] you explain why anyone would think that
[06:53] that problem is interesting or useful
[06:55] and absolutely focus on that and the
[06:58] last um a bayesian approach to on chess
[07:00] openings was a really really different
[07:02] approach um technically and uh it's just
[07:06] really potentially has a lot of
[07:07] applications uh to other domains so
[07:10] um congratulations to all those folks
[07:13] okay and now the moment we've all been
[07:15] waiting for um the winner of this year's
[07:17] poster competition um
[07:20] hopefully there's no home field
[07:22] advantage bias here but it is uh uh i i
[07:25] won't go so far as to say that it was a
[07:27] runaway winner but it was it was the
[07:28] clear winner that uh the panel uh uh
[07:31] really appreciated so
[07:32] uh concerns regarding sport climbing
[07:34] competition format and scoring system
[07:37] who's suffering by uh quan nguyen hannah
[07:39] butler and
[07:41] gregory matthews so uh congratulations
[07:43] um
[07:44] great work everybody
[07:48] and uh congratulations to kwon i want
[07:50] everyone to know i had nothing to do
[07:51] with this i was not voting i would
[07:53] imagine that most of the people on the
[07:54] panel would be less likely to vote
[07:56] knowing that i was part of the part of
[07:59] the uh
[08:00] the advising for that
[08:02] i didn't give myself a vote and if i had
[08:05] i would have never voted for greg so
[08:07] there was
[08:08] there was no
[08:09] no chicanery involved whatsoever it was
[08:12] just a really great it was a really
[08:13] great piece of work
[08:15] well quang
