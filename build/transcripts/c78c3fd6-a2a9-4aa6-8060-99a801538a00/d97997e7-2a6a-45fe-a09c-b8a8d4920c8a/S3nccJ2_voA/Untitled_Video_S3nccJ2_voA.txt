[00:06] it's 2m let's start our
[00:08] session so good afternoon everyone thank
[00:11] you for coming Welcome to our session on
[00:13] Sports analytics beyond the field I will
[00:17] be the chair for disc session I am Mary
[00:19] salv I am an assistant professor at the
[00:22] department of Statistics here
[00:25] at we will have four speakers in this
[00:28] session each speaker will have 17
[00:30] minutes for
[00:32] presentation followed by five minutes of
[00:35] Q&A if any questions arise during the
[00:38] presentation please reserve them till
[00:40] the speaker is
[00:42] done let's begin with our first Speaker
[00:46] Dr Jackson laier from bethley University
[00:50] his talk is about a new framework to
[00:52] estimate return on investment for player
[00:55] salaries in the National Basketball
[00:58] Association let's welcome
[01:05] thank you very much thank you for nice
[01:07] introduction so as alluded to today's
[01:10] goal is kind of a financial exercise but
[01:13] also statistical so you know we'll try
[01:19] to relate everything together here but
[01:20] really the objective is imagine yourself
[01:22] you're in the financial world you're
[01:23] trying to decides between two asset
[01:25] classes to invest a very natural
[01:28] starting point well let me look at the
[01:30] historically current between fund a and
[01:32] fund B and when you're in the financial
[01:35] World typically what's going in the
[01:37] investment is money and it's coming out
[01:39] with money so it's kind of a finance 101
[01:41] calculation I think where things get a
[01:43] little bit interesting is when the thing
[01:45] going in is monetary like a player's
[01:47] contract and the thing coming out is
[01:49] non-monetary like rebounds points what
[01:52] exactly is that worth how well are you
[01:54] doing relative to others so that's kind
[01:56] of the goal
[01:58] today and I mentioned Finance 101 I know
[02:01] this is one of stats conference so what
[02:04] you're looking at here this is a cash
[02:05] flow timeline and cf0 typically is your
[02:09] investment in so imagine you're buying
[02:10] like a rental property that's how much
[02:12] you purchase the property cf1 cf2 all
[02:15] the way up to CFN those are what the U
[02:18] cash flows you receive so generally
[02:21] speaking kind of a starting point how
[02:23] you calculate how well this particular
[02:25] investment is doing is that equation at
[02:27] the bottom you want the money that
[02:29] you're invested in to equal the
[02:32] discounted present value of cash flows
[02:34] throwing so what you're trying to find
[02:36] is that rate R so our goal is to
[02:40] replicate this equation using salary
[02:43] data and what's happening on the course
[02:45] right so we're going to try to build
[02:47] here now just very high level like
[02:50] review what's out there so there's a
[02:52] this is a basketball and Linux is a very
[02:54] big field it's growing rapidly but
[02:56] there's really three check boxes I tried
[02:58] to hit number one I want to operate on a
[03:00] per game basis and the reason for that
[03:02] is I want to treat each game like a
[03:05] potential cash flow that's kind of Step
[03:06] One also I want to try to use some of
[03:09] the more recent player tracking data
[03:11] that's available and then finally the
[03:13] big one I want to consider salary and
[03:15] oncore performance together and I think
[03:18] this is really kind of the final
[03:20] frontier of where at least professional
[03:22] level analy analytics goes because you
[03:25] know think about it two people sell a
[03:26] house for different amounts who does
[03:29] better well you really have to know how
[03:30] much they paid for that house through a
[03:32] formal calculation so it's a similar
[03:34] type of analysis
[03:36] here so this this slide this is really
[03:38] the entire manuscript and it's a
[03:41] five-part process so I think this is the
[03:44] intended novelty here and then we'll
[03:47] talk about each component and even I
[03:49] think a future is you can kind of take
[03:50] out stuff you don't like put stuff you
[03:52] do like into different spots so the
[03:55] first goal is you want to select a time
[03:56] period this is pretty natural so we're
[03:58] pretty much going to use one NBA regular
[04:00] season but it could be the last five
[04:01] years could be the last month that's the
[04:03] first thing you need to set next you
[04:06] need to do two things at the same time
[04:08] for each game in that time Horizon you
[04:11] need
[04:12] to
[04:14] uh I like okay so you need to do two
[04:19] things for each game in that time period
[04:20] number one figure out a way to
[04:21] distribute credit for each player within
[04:24] each game okay so this is one thing I'm
[04:26] going to spend some time with and the
[04:28] second thing is you need to estimate a
[04:30] dollar value of every single game in
[04:32] that investment rice once you have those
[04:34] two things they kind of smash together
[04:36] in part four where you're basically
[04:38] giving each player a dollar share after
[04:41] the game based on how they perform so a
[04:43] very good game get a big share a very
[04:45] before even negative game might actually
[04:47] owe money in this theoretical metric and
[04:50] then at the very end you have your cash
[04:51] flows you have your salary you can
[04:53] perform your Roi calculation so if we do
[04:55] this right we will achieve this as we go
[04:58] forward
[05:04] okay so part one I'm going to focus on
[05:07] one NBA regular season so now I want to
[05:09] talk a little bit about how to
[05:10] redistribute uh credit so there's a
[05:14] couple things that are out there one if
[05:15] you've been on basketball reference at
[05:16] all there is something called the game
[05:17] score it's a bit of a you know us it
[05:20] just box score statistics has some
[05:22] hardcore coefficients that's fine it's
[05:24] nice it's one game so I'm going to track
[05:26] this as well there's also something
[05:28] that's gone through a little bit more of
[05:29] a peer review this is called a win score
[05:31] similar approach just kind of calculate
[05:34] some statistics at the end try to give
[05:35] you a score based on that game so I'm
[05:38] going to propose something called the
[05:39] wind logic to do this but I'm also going
[05:41] to track these two just as a comparison
[05:45] point so this idea of a wind logic it's
[05:47] kind of a three-step thing just for the
[05:49] sake of time I'm sort of zooming over
[05:51] this at at a little bit higher level but
[05:53] number one I want to fit a logistic
[05:55] regression so the thing I think is
[05:57] important is wins different approach
[05:59] might be champ championships might be
[06:00] maximizing Revenue I'm going to imagine
[06:02] wins is the goal here so you can fit a
[06:05] logistic regression at the team level
[06:07] but then looking at the way Team
[06:09] statistics and basketball accumulate for
[06:11] each player I'm going to try to
[06:12] distribute that logic to each of the
[06:14] players based on that and then finally
[06:17] at the end there do this uh
[06:20] standardization where start with uh an
[06:23] average uniform share and then
[06:25] redistribute away from that average
[06:27] based on the performance in the game I'm
[06:29] going to try to walk through each of
[06:30] these to get our credit month so first
[06:34] of all logistic regression super high
[06:36] level here each game is a brely random
[06:38] variable that probability of success
[06:40] that probability of a win through this
[06:42] linking function is a linear equation
[06:45] based on some coar so like rebounds
[06:48] turnovers things like that what happens
[06:50] on the court so our goal is to estimate
[06:52] the beta coefficient for all the games
[06:55] in our data set at the team
[06:57] level now what's the case for basketball
[07:00] statistics and I think most most the
[07:02] statistics is what happens at the team
[07:05] level so here's the Celtics here the
[07:08] team total for the most part is the
[07:10] total of the individual players so a
[07:13] couple big things here there's some
[07:14] assumptions that I'm kind of loosely
[07:15] saying like Independence but especially
[07:17] this beta zero that intercept term if
[07:19] that's zero then what you can do is
[07:23] translate the team win probability to
[07:26] each of the individual players as their
[07:28] contribution so this is how it's trying
[07:30] to be uh allocated here
[07:34] so from this so that logic PM that's
[07:38] each of the players fitted logic based
[07:40] on reallocating this team contribution
[07:42] the index is changing a little bit here
[07:44] I focused only on players in a game so I
[07:46] apologize for the formulas I'm just
[07:48] talking at at a high level but there's I
[07:50] want to focus on this equation at the
[07:51] bottom because this is how I'm
[07:53] Distributing credit so first of all that
[07:55] logic there equation two at the bottom
[07:58] that's what's fitted from the model what
[08:00] I'm subtracting is the average for all
[08:02] the players versus all the games in the
[08:03] data set and then it's standardized and
[08:06] it's multiplied by one over M Bar what's
[08:08] m it's the average number of players in
[08:10] a game so I'm saying when the game
[08:12] starts everyone gets an average share
[08:14] and then if you have an above average
[08:15] game you get a little bit more if you
[08:17] have a below average game you get some
[08:18] taken away and if you have exactly
[08:20] average game you just get your uniform
[08:23] share so this is basically uh the credit
[08:27] model and you can do the same kind
[08:29] adjustment for game score win score so
[08:31] I'm using this loged approach you could
[08:33] pick your favorite metric and then try
[08:34] to do the same thing this is like a
[08:36] wealth redistribution tool want to think
[08:38] about it that
[08:39] way so what are some results look like
[08:43] this is uh where all the data comes from
[08:45] it's all publicly available I think the
[08:46] important thing for us is down at the
[08:48] bottom if you want this data if you want
[08:49] this code it's it's free it's out there
[08:51] so you can download
[08:53] it so I look you at the 2022 2023 NBA
[08:57] regular season first first thing here is
[09:00] just what is the distribution of these
[09:01] different credit models look like the
[09:03] wind logic that's blue you can see it's
[09:05] symmetric you can see it's they all have
[09:07] the same mean they all the same standard
[09:09] deviation so that one over Nar so
[09:11] they're all standardized that way but
[09:13] how they're distributed based on credit
[09:14] is different depending on the model wind
[09:16] score game score a little bit more right
[09:18] skewed win logic more symmetric again
[09:21] same mean same standing
[09:24] deviation one thing I also think is
[09:27] important just coming from a finance
[09:28] background a little bit is I really want
[09:30] to focus on what's happening on the
[09:32] court and in particular for a Miss game
[09:36] I want that to be a zero um the
[09:37] financial interpretation would be that's
[09:39] like a default so you define uh this
[09:43] equation three where you either get a
[09:45] zero or you get your games win lodic and
[09:47] then just assuming a zero interest rate
[09:49] you can just sum up over your entire
[09:51] season so this is like a present value
[09:53] of wind lodges over the entire season so
[09:57] what I think is nice about this is let's
[09:58] compare two here so at the top this is
[10:01] Kevin Durant this is his 2022 2023 NBA
[10:04] season Kevin Durant had an excellent
[10:06] season in the 47 games he played but due
[10:09] to injury there's a lot of missed games
[10:11] at the bottom this is tar e t e had a
[10:13] very solid season tar e played in all 82
[10:16] games what I think is important from
[10:18] this slide is this pvw that sum total is
[10:21] 4.5 for each player so this creates like
[10:24] a break even analysis for how many games
[10:27] does the Kevin Durant need to miss to be
[10:29] become a tar e or vice versa so this is
[10:31] just something I really haven't seen I
[10:33] thought is important when you're trying
[10:35] to think of this cash flow type
[10:40] analysis additionally just how does this
[10:42] metric look so I looked at uh the presid
[10:45] valley win logic so that's some total
[10:46] per season for all the players in the
[10:48] NBA I Want to Break It Out by position
[10:50] just because of the nature of basketball
[10:52] you know this we've heard the big man
[10:54] bias that's kind of coming true here as
[10:55] well but if you look at the five
[10:57] positions if you look at the lers all
[10:59] the way to the right these are the names
[11:01] that you know passes the sniff test at
[11:03] least seems pretty solid in that way
[11:06] it's interesting to see a couple Celtics
[11:07] up there um so again if you want all the
[11:09] loot all the results for all the players
[11:11] check out GitHub all the details are out
[11:15] there the other thing that's I think
[11:17] interesting is you can compare them so
[11:19] if you use a win logic and game score
[11:22] win score or your favorite this is a
[11:25] percentile plot so if they agreed
[11:27] completely you would get everything down
[11:29] that diagonal from the top left to the
[11:31] bottom right they'd all be on top of
[11:32] each other nice line where you get the
[11:34] disagreements is the off diagonals this
[11:36] is where the metrics disagree between
[11:38] certain players so you can see that game
[11:41] score win score on the top right pretty
[11:43] similar generally but then you go to the
[11:44] win loget pretty different in certain
[11:47] players so just I know this is a little
[11:49] bit more of a student Focus conference
[11:51] so how how might you use something like
[11:53] this just as an example this is a trade
[11:56] that happened this season between the
[11:57] Knicks and the Raptors so if you look at
[12:00] the players that each team receives if
[12:02] you go all the way to the right if you
[12:03] just look at the game score present
[12:05] value game score column it would appear
[12:08] that the Raptors probably won this trade
[12:10] uh just based on this metric if you look
[12:11] at the Players they received at the
[12:13] bottom those are pretty high percentiles
[12:15] compared to what the Knicks received on
[12:17] the other hand different player credit
[12:19] model you go to the wind lodic all the
[12:21] way to the left
[12:23] here how it feels about RJ Barrett is a
[12:26] lot different how it feels about
[12:27] pressure suchu is a lot different all of
[12:28] a sudden this looks a lot closer and
[12:30] then what you would need to get out of
[12:32] that draft pick to kind of get the
[12:34] difference so the only point of this
[12:35] slide different player valuation metrics
[12:38] this is how markets are made right teams
[12:39] feel differently about certain players
[12:41] and this is how trades come
[12:44] together okay so that's part one part
[12:48] two now assuming we have a player credit
[12:50] model you feel good about we need a
[12:52] dollar value of each game you could go
[12:55] crazy with this the model I want to use
[12:57] is just that the value of a game depends
[13:00] on how many people saw it so the first
[13:02] thing is how many people attended it at
[13:04] the gate and then whether or not it was
[13:06] on television so you get the television
[13:08] Revenue you get the advertising Revenue
[13:09] the simplistic model for which games are
[13:11] more valuable different approach might
[13:13] be standings related you have to decide
[13:15] on that but this is just if more people
[13:17] see it it's worth
[13:19] more so pretty standard so now we have a
[13:22] way to distribute credit a dollar value
[13:25] so we need to create the cash flows
[13:27] rather than throw a bunch of formulas at
[13:28] you I'll just give you an example so
[13:30] this is Lebron James Lebron james' game
[13:32] values he's on the Lakers this is that
[13:34] first Vector first Vector here sgb first
[13:38] game is worth $26.3 million according to
[13:40] my model second game $26.4 million all
[13:44] the way out to the last game what was
[13:46] his win logic apologize for all the
[13:48] decimals but this WL Vector that's his
[13:50] share according to my model so 8% the
[13:53] first game 99.7% the next game uh second
[13:56] to last game of the season below average
[13:58] game a little bit of a negative share
[14:00] and then 133% big number at the end how
[14:02] do you create the cash flows just a
[14:04] pairwise product that's what this little
[14:06] circle dot supposed to mean a computer
[14:08] science term so for example that 2.2 in
[14:10] that bottom Vector that's 26.3 time 08
[14:14] so now we have a vector of cash flows
[14:17] right so how do you calculate the return
[14:18] on
[14:19] investment our last step here well back
[14:22] to LeBron James right his salary is 44.4
[14:25] million that's cash flow zero his cash
[14:28] flows we got in the previous step these
[14:30] become the future cash flows so you
[14:32] solve for that rate R such that both
[14:35] sides are equal and you have estimated
[14:37] the return on investment for LeBron
[14:39] James based on last season couple things
[14:41] here if that number feels low LeBron
[14:43] missed 27 games so there's a lot of
[14:45] zeros in there that's not pictured also
[14:47] doesn't include playoff games so you
[14:48] might want to make an adjustment that
[14:51] way so that's it so what does these
[14:53] results look like for uh this group
[14:56] overall so
[14:59] the estimated game values these are just
[15:01] those Alpha coefficients these are basic
[15:03] uh estimates you know just a standard
[15:05] kind of average here again nice sniff
[15:07] test what are the top five teams with
[15:09] the most value Lakers Warriors Celtics
[15:12] you know these are Big Market teams and
[15:14] one caveat from this is if you are a
[15:16] player on a team with more valuable
[15:18] games all it's equal you're going to
[15:19] generate a higher
[15:21] Roi so then this is the ROI of all the
[15:24] players in the league for last season
[15:27] just based on the win logic uh so on the
[15:29] vertical axis this is return on
[15:31] investment on the horizontal axis this
[15:33] is a log of the player salary no
[15:35] surprise as the salary is higher right
[15:37] it's harder to generate a higher return
[15:39] and I think what uh you can take away
[15:42] from this is just what are some of the
[15:43] players that stand out right uh versus
[15:46] the players that don't generate a higher
[15:48] return and the one thing I would
[15:50] emphasize from this is there's no
[15:51] minimums game play the only thing that's
[15:53] I control for here is you need a league
[15:55] A league minimum salary that's the only
[15:58] thing so if you don't even play playing
[15:59] two games that's going to affect your uh
[16:03] Roi one other thing you can do from this
[16:06] treat the positions as asset classes
[16:08] right so this is a basic Financial term
[16:11] really statistics term it's coefficient
[16:13] of variation standard deviation divided
[16:15] by the mean Roi for the players in that
[16:18] position the goal here is what how much
[16:21] uh risk am I taking per return so
[16:24] something like this in the First Column
[16:25] the wind logic would say point guard is
[16:28] where there's kind of have a lot of
[16:29] volatility in your return versus the
[16:31] center position a little bit safer it's
[16:34] interesting to compare game scores kind
[16:36] of flatter among the different positions
[16:38] just an example the type of metric you
[16:39] could do uh when you're making player
[16:42] Personnel
[16:44] decisions okay so just kind of a wrap up
[16:46] slide here so I think this is the first
[16:48] thing I've seen that tries to combine
[16:49] everything together right so you get
[16:51] this Encore performance and then how
[16:53] does it get this uh return on investment
[16:56] I think in addition to like NBA teams
[16:57] right this might be interesting them but
[16:59] also the players right you can advocate
[17:00] for more you're being underpaid things
[17:02] like that and finally this has all been
[17:05] a retrospective analysis right
[17:06] historical return but you can instead
[17:08] project what's going to happen on the
[17:10] court and then do that to generate your
[17:12] cash flows and discount that back and
[17:15] then finally I really want to emphasize
[17:16] this is you can customize this however
[17:18] you want right you don't like the wind
[17:19] lodic fine plug your own in there get
[17:21] your own cash flows you can do more
[17:23] precise salaries uh you could include
[17:26] off Court Revenue like jersey sales you
[17:28] want playoff games in there whatever and
[17:30] then finally maybe this could apply to
[17:33] uh other sports okay so this is the
[17:37] framework again this is the intended uh
[17:40] paper here and then this is my
[17:42] information like I said there's a GI
[17:44] GitHub out there has all this code has
[17:46] this data latest version of the
[17:48] manuscript I have a couple minutes for
[17:50] questions I know I kind of Bove through
[17:52] that but
[18:00] questions question to Dr so I have a
[18:03] question on I I saw Derek White's value
[18:06] was very high uh that was like you know
[18:08] interesting and uh you know that
[18:11] happened from the trade from Sports to
[18:13] Celtics but you know I thought I don't
[18:14] think Celtic was like expecting that
[18:17] because you know they're quite was good
[18:19] in sports but like wasn't like this good
[18:21] right uh so like what would you like so
[18:25] like you you saying that we can like
[18:27] change the model to like consider for
[18:28] like different trade and stuff uh but
[18:31] also like there's an interaction between
[18:32] like teams right uh if we want to like
[18:34] make prediction like like because if
[18:37] like the manager want to use this model
[18:39] for like uh planning maybe that would be
[18:42] a like important Point like you have any
[18:44] insight on like how to make this
[18:47] interaction that like we have never
[18:49] seen yeah I mean this is kind of the
[18:51] inherent trickiness right
[18:54] so Financial perspective you might try
[18:56] to find a distressed asset right think
[18:59] okay if we bring it in here with our uh
[19:01] orchestration turn it around and you can
[19:05] you can go as crazy as you want with
[19:07] part two here so really try to control
[19:09] for different things maybe what w games
[19:12] for the Celtics approach versus the
[19:14] Spurs and then try to translate that
[19:16] player so what would this player
[19:18] generate within our team versus another
[19:20] team so just have your own model I think
[19:23] the one trade-off of this is I want to
[19:25] emphasize the overall thing and the more
[19:28] crazy I go with part two it distracts
[19:30] from the overall so you're absolutely
[19:32] right but uh that's not necessarily in
[19:35] here it's kind of average
[19:38] across questions there's a lot of
[19:42] players that are contributing
[19:45] II I'm making less
[19:48] money
[19:50] yes so I mean I don't know much who
[19:54] those so can you tell us something about
[19:57] those those people up
[20:00] there so at the tip up like 90% Roi yeah
[20:04] these These are players making like the
[20:05] league minimum that happen to get more
[20:07] playing time so they're a little bit
[20:09] unusual um okay the NBA is a little bit
[20:12] unique in that player salaries are kind
[20:14] of dictated by contract length sometimes
[20:16] so if you have a player very early in
[20:18] that career who's really outperforming
[20:20] it's a big Market inefficiency very
[20:22] regulated oh I see so that's a little
[20:24] bit what's happening whereas all the way
[20:25] to the right these are the max salary
[20:28] players very hard to get that back at
[20:30] least based on
[20:34] regular
[20:35] [Music]
[20:37] questions yeah do you think that some
[20:39] adjustment for like salary cap based off
[20:42] different teams now increases over the
[20:44] years would be necessary if you were to
[20:46] try and build
[20:47] that so that's uh I guess the
[20:51] interesting thing there is the salary is
[20:53] the percentage of the cap so it's not
[20:56] necessarily the salary cap number but I
[20:59] do think there's penalties for how far
[21:01] you go over so if say you're a team
[21:04] that's on the edge and you need a center
[21:06] you might try to get no avom right what
[21:08] you're going to get based on that salary
[21:10] that might help you that way so like uh
[21:13] but a more complete analysis would be
[21:15] how much does it cost this team versus
[21:17] another team I
[21:22] agre
[21:23] [Music]
[21:25] questions I have a question what does a
[21:27] negative share
[21:30] they don't the theoretical value right
[21:33] so it's not actually money back but it's
[21:36] more this is what an average player
[21:38] based on this model would have produced
[21:40] this is what you produced it is less
[21:43] therefore you have
[21:48] short
[21:49] [Music]
[21:53] questions more questions
[22:02] let's go to our second speaker
[22:06] sh from Yale
[22:08] University Shin will talk about
[22:11] estimating the age condition average
[22:14] treatment effect curves application for
[22:17] assessing load management strategies in
[22:19] NBA
[22:30] let's give a round
[22:32] [Music]
[22:33] of I'm very honored to speak here and
[22:36] actually like the early version of this
[22:38] project was presented two years ago in
[22:42] this conference it was a very early
[22:43] version now we have prep like submission
[22:46] on this so huge thanks for the organizer
[22:49] for all the effort it has been great for
[22:51] M the development at least this project
[22:54] and I'm a fourth year PD student at in
[22:56] statistic and data science this work is
[22:59] collaboration with Laura forer and
[23:02] Bri so um so the objective of this like
[23:06] a presentation is to connect age carb
[23:09] and causal inference and so if you don't
[23:12] understand my framework that's fine if
[23:13] you can you know take a if you can get
[23:16] something from AG Cal inference that
[23:18] would be uh enough for my presentation I
[23:21] would be very happy uh so this is H it's
[23:23] very simple so this is a Kobe Bran's
[23:25] Point per game per uh like xaxis Ag and
[23:29] why have his performance and when he
[23:31] starts um like in the league like first
[23:35] he start no but he start like getting
[23:37] more experience and his performance gets
[23:39] better and once he gets in the peak like
[23:41] he declin because he gets old right so
[23:44] this is it's it's very simple
[23:46] um concept I don't know like which is
[23:49] the best ter is like we call Edge curve
[23:51] but I know one Greg called like eding
[23:54] curve so I I I don't really know like
[23:56] which is the right term um so but Ard
[23:59] could be very like different so like
[24:02] like I was showing the Kobe bran one but
[24:04] if we see for like different players uh
[24:07] there's different pattern for the
[24:08] decline so this is very interesting like
[24:10] Ed C like the shape of the Ed card it
[24:12] will like reveal us how fast they would
[24:15] decline or like whether like that
[24:17] depends on position or like it's it's
[24:20] very important to understand what like
[24:21] drives them to drop because like you
[24:24] know this would like um give us a good
[24:27] information on how many years we should
[24:29] like extend the contract or how much
[24:31] money we should pay for the each player
[24:34] and like the shape also different looks
[24:36] different uh if we change from point per
[24:38] game to rebound per game for example
[24:40] look quite different even in the rebound
[24:43] rebounds consist uh rebound consists of
[24:46] offensive part and defensive part if we
[24:48] see that defensive part offensive part
[24:50] sorry it declined much faster because um
[24:53] offensive rebound is much more physical
[24:56] than defensive rebounds so this is a
[24:59] veryy short intro on H curve and the
[25:02] contribution of our paper is three Vols
[25:05] so the first thing we did is uh we
[25:08] incorporate the game level data so if we
[25:10] compare uh if we see the literature on
[25:13] Ed curve uh most of the like the model
[25:16] that um is like presented is season
[25:18] level data so like so like we it could
[25:21] be helpful for like contct determination
[25:24] but game level data like actually um has
[25:27] a very rich information such as like
[25:29] back to back games or team you play for
[25:31] team you compete against and Etc there
[25:33] are so many compounder that like Drive
[25:36] the performance of each of the player
[25:38] and this will make us enable us to make
[25:40] the decision for each of the games
[25:42] instead of just the contr so for example
[25:45] if like you are the Lakers um manager
[25:47] and Lebron James playing against Denver
[25:49] like tomorrow then maybe you could like
[25:51] predict what would be the treatment what
[25:53] would be the their the performance in
[25:56] like that specific scenario
[25:59] and in the second like contribution is
[26:01] that like we provide a framework to
[26:03] invest estimate H conditional treatement
[26:05] effect so we have some treatment in our
[26:07] case is the rest like whether the game
[26:10] is back to back or not back to back and
[26:12] we will provide a framework or to
[26:15] estimate that uh treatment effect of
[26:17] like rest whether that rest like
[26:19] actually matters or not because there's
[26:20] a lot of like controversy in load
[26:22] Management in NBA and finally we assess
[26:25] I use this framework to assess that load
[26:28] management strategy in uh
[26:30] NBA okay so how many of you I mean I
[26:34] know this is a very student like Focus
[26:36] conference so I wanted to give a very
[26:37] very short introduction of Cal how many
[26:39] of you know what's the difference
[26:41] between correlation and
[26:43] causation okay so yeahh I will then I
[26:47] will spend a little bit time on this so
[26:49] so this is a shk and ice cream cells
[26:51] right and it's pretty correlated so does
[26:54] eating ice cream cause me to being
[26:56] attacked by by shark
[26:58] you think that sounds like
[27:02] reasonable yeah so maybe not right maybe
[27:05] like eating ice cream like doesn't have
[27:07] anything to do with the shark but what
[27:08] is really happening is that in the
[27:10] summer like the temperature goes out you
[27:12] go to the
[27:13] beach then like you maybe receive like
[27:16] shark attack or like you eat more like
[27:18] ice cream right so so what it is really
[27:20] causing is the Sun or the temperature
[27:23] and these are the byproduct because the
[27:25] sun is Shifting those two barable in the
[27:27] same direction
[27:28] right uh but you know this is a sports
[27:31] conference so I'm not going to talk
[27:32] about sharp and ice cream and you know
[27:35] this could be like um translated on our
[27:39] problem so maybe like there's a
[27:40] correlation between like you know if one
[27:43] player is good scoring uh they could be
[27:45] good on rebounding like itself but the
[27:48] amount you score doesn't cost you more
[27:51] like rebound I mean in the game the play
[27:53] byplay game like it that it it might be
[27:57] true because if you do the rebound maybe
[27:59] you can score more but if you see in the
[28:01] game level maybe this is just a
[28:03] correlation of the and what we want to
[28:05] know is like whether resting one or two
[28:07] more days actually it ca uh this
[28:10] performance let go up
[28:13] right um okay so there's another example
[28:17] that I have so let's say like we have
[28:19] three players and um the treatment is
[28:22] whether like you're playing back Tob
[28:23] back games and this is the observe point
[28:26] for game so like looking at this like
[28:27] play play one who didn't play a back to
[28:30] back game uh scored sorry it should have
[28:34] been on example but okay so okay never
[28:38] mind um so let's say the player one
[28:40] didn't uh play back to back and scored
[28:43] like 20 and okay let's let's say that
[28:46] this is
[28:47] yes the player one like did play back to
[28:51] back and scor 20 and player two and
[28:53] three um is arrested and they scor like
[28:57] St
[28:58] is this going to be enough to determine
[29:01] that actually like resting is like
[29:03] effective so that's that's one of the
[29:05] question and this could be Sol by one of
[29:07] the poten like most renowned framework
[29:10] in Cal inference called potential
[29:12] outcome frame and potential outcome
[29:14] framework actually is a missing value
[29:16] problem so we observe this value like I
[29:20] mean I will sorry I miss no yes but we
[29:24] observe this value because like we
[29:26] observe the value of player one when
[29:28] they played back to back games but we
[29:30] didn't observe the value of the player
[29:32] one when he did uh play the back to back
[29:35] game so this is a missing B right and
[29:38] why this is important this is important
[29:40] because if the potential outcome is
[29:44] something like this after like there's
[29:47] no effect so like estimating the the
[29:50] after like Conta uh would actually give
[29:53] us the the true treatment effect and not
[29:56] um like so the frequen is approach would
[29:58] not be enough like just a is not enough
[30:02] but like be like looking at the
[30:03] potential outcome uh enable us to
[30:07] discover more like true causal uh thing
[30:10] rather than like not just a correlation
[30:12] so now that we are in the same page on
[30:15] causal inference and what did let me
[30:17] explain my framework uh so the framework
[30:20] like there's two ingredients on the
[30:22] framework the first one is the
[30:24] expectation function sorry for a lot of
[30:26] like notations but basically the
[30:28] takeaway is that new zero is the
[30:30] expectation of the control group so
[30:32] control group in this case is the um
[30:34] players who are playing back to back and
[30:36] mu1 is a treatment group who are more
[30:39] rested so like you have like two
[30:41] different expectation for the player on
[30:43] different contos and under this
[30:46] framework we can Define that each
[30:48] conditional treatment as a difference of
[30:50] those so it's it's quite simple it looks
[30:52] more difficult in like mathematical poll
[30:54] because people likees to impress people
[30:57] by using
[30:58] more complicated notations but it's
[31:01] actually simple um so how okay so now
[31:05] that we define estimate how do we define
[31:08] estimate this like a and we use like
[31:11] three metal learning approach provided
[31:14] by kunel in
[31:15] 2019 uh and like it will allow us to use
[31:18] any predictive model or any supervised
[31:20] machine learning model that it's on your
[31:22] like head uh traditional AG curve like
[31:26] analysis is done like based on ol but
[31:29] the problem is that it's hard to capture
[31:31] the nonlinearity of like or interaction
[31:33] because you have to specify the the
[31:35] interaction rather than like you do uret
[31:38] or random Forest it can capture the
[31:41] nonlinearity like by the intrinsic F of
[31:44] the intrinsic like construction of the
[31:47] model right so there is a three types of
[31:49] learner I'm not going over like those
[31:51] details but s learner is the simplest
[31:54] and X learner is the most complicated
[31:56] one there is those like algorithm
[31:58] um if there's question I can go over it
[32:01] but basically this m means that you are
[32:04] putting any machine learning model it
[32:05] could be like o so like if you are have
[32:08] used any R like notation it would be
[32:11] like this is the outcome and these are
[32:14] the C so like you can see as this is
[32:16] fitting a regression when m is like
[32:18] regression so like basically what you
[32:20] fit one model where the treat and the
[32:22] treatment is the coefficient of your uh
[32:25] like the the treatment variable the
[32:28] effect is the treat variable is a x
[32:31] Learner in the T learner you fit two
[32:33] models like what you fit one model for
[32:36] control group and one model for
[32:37] treatment group so you fit like two
[32:39] regression or any mod uh so the one like
[32:43] intive way to see in like U like pro and
[32:48] con is that in s learner you're fting
[32:51] only one model so you don't need a lot
[32:53] of data set so because like um you it's
[32:56] less complicated but in learner let's
[32:58] say like you use the 100 observation
[33:00] here you split up in case like treatment
[33:03] group and group are like the same number
[33:05] you now are putting like two models on
[33:08] 50 observations so like this will like
[33:10] uh suffer more
[33:12] the the number number sample is like a
[33:15] smaller Lear more complicated it has to
[33:18] be with like the whole machine learning
[33:20] thing that the biases when if you do
[33:22] this and like this makes like more like
[33:25] unbiased estimator but I'm not going to
[33:27] over
[33:28] that okay so now so this is the way I'm
[33:32] estimating the
[33:34] town and okay so I'm saying like oh this
[33:37] is flexible and you can use any machine
[33:39] learning model and we have three
[33:40] Learners so now the problem is okay
[33:43] which combination should we use we can
[33:44] use ol lines like uh the curing curve
[33:49] literature has done combined with any of
[33:51] the learner we can use OLS SL with s and
[33:54] PX or you can we can use more complex
[33:57] random for model with like any of the
[34:00] combination so at least there's six
[34:02] combinations that we can try out and uh
[34:05] you know you can try neet you can try ex
[34:07] and and you know then like you have more
[34:10] comination that like you
[34:12] try and uh to determine which
[34:22] combination I still have six minutes six
[34:26] minutes five minutes
[34:29] question
[34:31] uh okay so so I was talking about all
[34:35] the combination possible combination and
[34:37] we have to choose pick which would be
[34:39] the best for our like problem so we
[34:42] devis this scenario um us usually based
[34:46] on like one the you know author of The
[34:48] Ed like paper that is present in this uh
[34:52] so what the first um scenario is Conant
[34:55] effect so if we see control group and
[34:58] treatment group they have the same shift
[34:59] and it's just shifted and the second
[35:01] scenario is line treatment effect so
[35:03] this means that the rest is affecting
[35:06] more if you are older so like the the
[35:09] effect of the treatment effect is bigger
[35:11] as you get like older and finally the
[35:14] last scenario is like the totally like
[35:15] very complex one where like the treated
[35:18] group and control group is like looks
[35:19] totally different and we evaluated like
[35:22] our uh approaches uh on those cases and
[35:26] one thing that I want to know is that
[35:28] that like du to the fundamental problem
[35:30] of caal inference which is that you
[35:32] never observe your contracture right so
[35:34] let's say like your contracture is
[35:36] taking aspirin or not taking aspirin you
[35:38] only observe the case if you take the
[35:40] aspin you only observe taking the aspin
[35:42] like your your you wouldn't observe your
[35:44] headache when you didn't take the ASP So
[35:46] like um this simulation like this C
[35:50] effect models can be Al only evaluated
[35:53] using the simulation uh because in that
[35:56] case like you have the fure like both of
[35:58] the values that could be simulated so
[36:01] this is a result of the simulation uh as
[36:04] we expected the most the simplest model
[36:06] which
[36:07] ISS does very well in the simplest
[36:10] scenar like simulation uh which is like
[36:13] almost the error is almost zero but as
[36:15] as it gets like complicated which in
[36:18] simulation two where the treatment
[36:20] effect was like linear the learner with
[36:22] random Forest gets got the lowest MC and
[36:27] for the most complex one actually the ex
[36:29] learner with ROM Forest got the least MC
[36:33] okay now based on this scenario which
[36:35] one should we use for our NBA data
[36:38] probably in NBA data is complex enough
[36:41] uh as in simulation 3 because it has a
[36:43] lot of Compounders such a temperature or
[36:45] like how many hours they travel whether
[36:47] it is back to back and there are so many
[36:49] Compounders so maybe like the good like
[36:52] a combination of the learner and base
[36:54] learner would be the X learner with
[36:56] random for
[36:58] uh so we appli this to NBA data to
[37:01] assess the load management uh bit of the
[37:04] background on like load management the
[37:06] success is that coer in 2018 and 2019
[37:09] season he only play 60 games out of 82
[37:12] and he was a top form playoff and go the
[37:14] championship there's critique since this
[37:16] season uh there's a player participation
[37:19] policy I require St players participate
[37:22] more frequently and our contribution is
[37:24] that we did this
[37:26] quantitatively um there's a note but I'm
[37:29] still okay so these are the results for
[37:32] the KE learner uh with like condition
[37:34] expectation function it's the first
[37:36] ingredient I was so for xer with random
[37:39] for that I said that it's the best model
[37:40] we cannot FL both of them because uh the
[37:43] nature of L Crossing we can only uh we
[37:46] get only the car for the treatment
[37:48] effect itself uh in key Lear um the
[37:52] taking the advantage is that you can
[37:53] actually PL the both of the the pattern
[37:56] for example uh uh mu1 is a treatment
[37:59] group so like mu1 the red one is AR
[38:01] rested players and mu zero is the not
[38:04] the back to back players and we can see
[38:06] that me rating is generly significant in
[38:08] a booster up confidence interval 90% but
[38:11] mainly it's coming from defensive end if
[38:14] you see the the effect is way sign way
[38:16] more significant in defensive end rather
[38:18] than offensive end and this might be
[38:20] because you know if you are like um tier
[38:23] and you're playing maybe like you you
[38:26] you have to play well in opens because
[38:27] you have a lot of attention but in
[38:29] defense you can just like relax a little
[38:30] bit little bit and um so like the
[38:34] treatment effect of resting uh would get
[38:37] higher in a in the defensive end rather
[38:39] than offensive
[38:40] end and we did this for like both close
[38:44] but um due to the time I think I skip
[38:46] most of it uh but like the is deled
[38:50] ining like stronger but here like um the
[38:54] only one that are kind of significant
[38:56] are um blocks and skills where like
[38:59] which are the Box statistics that are
[39:01] more like physically like requiring
[39:04] right and then we did um analysis for
[39:07] field go percentage and we see that the
[39:11] to the left is the field General field
[39:13] go percentage and the middle one the
[39:15] three point and this is a true shooting
[39:17] and we can see that for threep pointer
[39:20] um like less significant than General
[39:24] field cure like a percentage in the that
[39:27] the right and this might be because as
[39:29] you get closer to the rim like gets more
[39:32] physical so like you need more like more
[39:35] or when you are like closer to the rim
[39:37] rather than three pointer right um we
[39:40] did the same thing for the excler with
[39:42] FR Forest as I mentioned like not as a d
[39:45] learner where we can plot both of the
[39:47] shapes we can only plot the treatment
[39:49] effects and we can see the same thing
[39:51] that the defensive rating is way more
[39:53] significant than than offensive end so
[39:56] concluding that the W matters more in
[39:58] defense rather than
[40:01] offense and uh this is for the shooting
[40:04] percentage we could also see that uh the
[40:06] red one is a three point percentage so
[40:08] if that overlaps with zero means that
[40:11] the rest is not significant uh we could
[40:13] see also that the field call percentage
[40:15] more significant than in frequence
[40:17] shooting and this is my last slide uh so
[40:20] breast matters somewhat um but more in
[40:24] defensive end and uh we advanced
[40:28] literature by incorporating reach game
[40:30] level data deving a framework to
[40:31] incorporate the cality and we allow
[40:35] capure nor linear Trends using those
[40:37] machine learning techniques uh the
[40:38] future work would be to do a multile
[40:40] treatment so like we can differentiate
[40:42] between like now we are doing back to
[40:44] back and not back to back but maybe we
[40:46] can differentiate about one day of rest
[40:48] was a two day rest or two day rest as a
[40:50] three day rest and like we estimate that
[40:52] those effect would be going to be like
[40:54] some kind of low shape and we can also
[40:57] like appli to fa index that was talking
[40:59] in the the morning okay that's that's it
[41:02] thanks so much for the
[41:09] uh a few minutes for questions one
[41:14] minute any
[41:18] questions did you have any measures of
[41:20] uncertainty associated with your oh I
[41:23] mean I have the Boost shop uh like
[41:26] interval right uh I missed that Sor yeah
[41:28] so so there is
[41:32] the yeah those BS are good comp interval
[41:36] uh it's hard to get it like distribution
[41:39] because um the model gets more complex
[41:41] than
[41:44] tral so you copy at
[41:47] 4 NBA players NBA players oh yeah
[41:52] actually there are not many like player
[41:54] in my data set after 13 age so there
[41:57] here's the appendix we can see that at
[41:59] 42 I have uh only 10 games and like
[42:04] mainly non back to back like player
[42:06] older like with 42 age never played a
[42:09] back to back game like according to this
[42:12] so uh we cut because in there is a
[42:16] overlap assumption so at least you have
[42:18] to have uh like one observation in
[42:20] certain group and for 41 and 42 we have
[42:23] the um violation of that assumption so
[42:26] we the uh I think we
[42:29] have and what that's a great point that
[42:32] I I forgot to mention is that the
[42:34] confidence span for like older player is
[42:37] way wider because of the small sample
[42:39] size
[42:46] yes yeah it's hard to survive in NBA
[43:01] yeah yeah that's a great Point yeah it's
[43:02] because of it could be because of
[43:04] survival but also because uh when
[43:07] players are too old um like the as we
[43:11] can see in the band the estimate is not
[43:13] very accurate because U you know there's
[43:15] a lot of that mean might be yeah that's
[43:19] a good
[43:20] point more
[43:23] questions no more then let's
[43:47] way from Leola University Chicago she's
[43:50] going to talk about empirical
[43:52] determination of basketball baseball
[43:55] erors a most for analysis in Major leag
[43:59] Baseball let's welcome
[44:10] Dr okay hopefully that works start this
[44:15] okay so kind of a you know fancy title
[44:18] but all I'm trying to say is that I'm
[44:21] using data to talk about something that
[44:23] people have publically discussed and
[44:26] debated for a while and I'm just like I
[44:28] went and did the I did it um and really
[44:32] I would like also to say that I'm a
[44:34] statistician first and foremost and I
[44:37] did this work with Greg Matthews who I'm
[44:39] sure you've seen a hundred times at this
[44:40] conference um and we were chatting and I
[44:45] was like oh I I I know the methodology
[44:47] to answer this question think this what
[44:49] I do all the time um oh there we go so
[44:53] I'll kind of introduce the problem the
[44:55] methodology just like a little babyit
[44:57] and then really go through a lot of the
[44:58] results because we have a lot of
[45:00] interesting results that I think you
[45:01] guys will think are interesting so high
[45:04] level I think this can be used in a ton
[45:06] of applications and I would like more
[45:08] people to do it um especially in sports
[45:10] it's so like full of data so basically
[45:13] does a sport like major league baseball
[45:15] change over time like there's changes to
[45:17] how the game is played all of this is
[45:20] about we now have data to understand how
[45:22] we can change the game um so how do
[45:25] aspects and measures the game change
[45:27] over time and then if they do change
[45:30] when are they changing and so what we
[45:33] want is to understand understand shifts
[45:35] in baseball and I look at a couple of
[45:37] other things like within a team and so
[45:39] basically what we're asking here is what
[45:41] are the eras of baseball and then
[45:44] specifically within a team or what I
[45:46] will say is a
[45:47] franchise um are there dynasties or
[45:50] collapses of dynasties um within a
[45:55] team again okay okay so people have
[45:57] hypothesize this they're like dead ball
[45:59] era life ball era la la la eras of
[46:02] things um and so people have
[46:05] hypothesized a lot of these written
[46:06] about them and it has been done
[46:08] empirically a couple of times through uh
[46:11] what I'm going to use but there were
[46:12] only looking at a single statistic so
[46:14] like how do home runs change over time
[46:17] how do other things change over time so
[46:20] they did it on slugging home runs um
[46:24] batting and RBIs
[46:27] um uh batting average and then uh
[46:31] somebody did it on a single player of
[46:33] very bonds and looking at like did he
[46:35] have a change due to steroid use in in
[46:39] some of his metrics um and then they've
[46:42] also done it for competitive balance
[46:44] where was The Economist in there I'm
[46:45] also working on paper right now about
[46:47] competitive balance stu um for all leags
[46:50] using the same methodology so these were
[46:52] all just done one person one statistic
[46:55] but is that an era of baseball how does
[46:58] the whole game change together we need
[47:00] to account for more than just home runs
[47:03] right we want to think about them all
[47:05] together so I want to identify and
[47:07] confirm these changes overall in the
[47:10] game um then specifically by those game
[47:12] metrics and then I also want to look
[47:14] within teams and find these kind of
[47:16] Dynasty teams um and I want to do that
[47:20] multivariately I want to do that
[47:21] together where I'm accounting for all of
[47:23] these things changing together where I
[47:25] say they have one change B on all of
[47:27] these different
[47:29] things so change Point methodology I
[47:32] don't think anyone's done that too much
[47:35] so I wanted to introduce a univariate
[47:37] case this is a very easy visual change
[47:39] point where you can see it's just kind
[47:40] of bouncing around at this constant flat
[47:42] rate and then it jumps to up here so
[47:45] you're like this location in time is the
[47:47] change point this is very easy to see
[47:49] with our eyes but in real life it's much
[47:51] more
[47:51] complicated and how do you how do you
[47:54] empirically determine that the easiest
[47:57] function to use is the Q sum statistic
[48:01] which basically is a weighted average of
[48:03] if I take a segment here and then I look
[48:05] at the rest of the segment how big is
[48:07] their difference and it's like a
[48:09] weighted average so if I just look
[48:12] really at a small place here and then
[48:14] the rest of this I'm not going to say
[48:16] that that's too different from each
[48:17] other and so this statistic at the
[48:19] bottom is taking along and saying okay
[48:22] if I cut it right here this is the Q sub
[48:25] suggested we can see that Max is out
[48:27] here where if I took this segment I'm
[48:30] going to say that it's very different
[48:31] than this segment okay so that's a c
[48:34] you're kind of working across time and
[48:36] so what's important to remember for this
[48:38] in the rest of the presentation is ay
[48:40] this is looking in the past so don't ask
[48:42] me about the future um and B it depends
[48:46] on how much time we're looking at so if
[48:48] we're too close to those sides it's
[48:50] really hard to detect anything so when
[48:53] you think about 2020 which is the end of
[48:55] my data I can't tell anything else
[48:57] because it's too close to the end um so
[49:01] that's Q sum basically um and again this
[49:04] is univariate so what do I do quick
[49:07] method slide um there's something called
[49:10] a double Q sum that uh these creators
[49:13] came up with which basically is doing it
[49:15] multivariately so I have all these time
[49:18] series and I have a bunch of Q sums for
[49:21] all of them across every single time
[49:24] point and so what they do is they order
[49:26] and kind of rank them and I'm looking at
[49:29] just the biggest ones where they're all
[49:31] happening across all the time series so
[49:33] like certain changes if they're really
[49:37] present across the whole game of
[49:38] baseball should come up in lots of
[49:40] sports
[49:42] measures um and so they also use an
[49:45] algorithm normally Univar use binary
[49:48] segmentation which is like a tree and it
[49:50] kind of just splits it and it's like I
[49:51] found a change point so we'll get this
[49:53] half and the second half and you keep
[49:55] going recursively until you can't find
[49:56] any more and scarified binary
[49:58] segmentation is a high dimensional
[50:02] version of the same algorithm so simple
[50:04] things push to the multivariant case and
[50:07] high dimensionality
[50:09] okay um
[50:11] again okay so got this data from the
[50:15] Llama data set uh kind of like late
[50:18] 1800s to 2020 was when it
[50:21] ended and uh there was honestly not that
[50:25] much missing data in there which was
[50:26] pretty impressive so I just did like
[50:28] simple um imputation for that and then I
[50:32] standardized everything to as a year so
[50:35] I just have the year average of these
[50:38] things for the different teams um and I
[50:41] standardize them to kind of per game
[50:44] rates because different seasons will
[50:46] play different amounts of
[50:49] games and then specifically I'm doing
[50:51] these three types of different analyses
[50:54] um which I'm going to call leak level
[50:55] metric level and franchise level so
[50:58] League level that's like does baseball
[51:00] change over time and so that I look at
[51:04] four statistics across 16 teams um from
[51:08] 1900 to 2020 so all of them had to exist
[51:11] for this whole period of time and all
[51:13] four these statistics we deemed crucial
[51:16] to like the league of baseball and like
[51:19] stayed consistently important to
[51:20] baseball throughout the whole period of
[51:22] time home runs strikeouts walks and
[51:24] solar bases so that's the lead level and
[51:28] the panel the thing of replicated time
[51:30] series is those metrics so I'm looking
[51:33] at those four statistics together then
[51:36] the metric level
[51:38] stats um are I'm basically looking where
[51:43] I'm
[51:45] repeating um I'm repeating 16 teams so
[51:49] those are the repeated things that I'm
[51:51] looking at now and I'm looking at um
[51:54] home runs strikeouts walk Sol and BAS
[51:56] runs and then attendance so now I'm just
[51:58] looking at these different metrics to
[52:00] see how they change in time kind of by
[52:02] themselves but across these teams that
[52:03] have existed for this whole period of
[52:05] time and then the last one which I think
[52:08] is the coolest and what everyone is
[52:10] probably going to ask questions about
[52:11] because they' be like there's my team
[52:13] let me ask questions about that um the
[52:16] 32 modern franchise teams we basically
[52:18] look at within the
[52:21] team uh kind of a offense versus defense
[52:25] kind of um
[52:27] combination of metrics runs home runs um
[52:32] hits walks strikeouts and then basically
[52:35] the against version so if you have like
[52:38] kind of an average team they should
[52:40] Plateau around zero but if you're like a
[52:42] really good team compared to the rest of
[52:44] the whole league you should be a
[52:45] positive kind of team otherwise you'll
[52:47] be a negative kind of team looking at
[52:50] all those um so those are kind of how
[52:53] the data is structured which is why I'm
[52:55] going to go through a lot of results
[52:57] but so again League level is like does
[52:59] baseball change um metric specific is
[53:02] like how do these statistics change over
[53:04] time and then franchise level is like
[53:07] are there dynasties like are you a
[53:08] really good team or a really bad
[53:11] team um okay so leag level
[53:14] analysis so there are four change points
[53:18] here and actually secret I also looked
[53:20] at variance change points I only describ
[53:23] how talk about a me but there's also
[53:25] variability um you can kind of see
[53:27] visually with your eyes this is like
[53:28] early early baseball they are all over
[53:30] the place cross um walks home rad Sol
[53:34] bases strike El huge variability here
[53:37] and then a variance change point and
[53:38] then closely after a mean change point
[53:41] and so you can kind of think of like
[53:43] this is an ERA this is an ERA this is an
[53:45] era and so on okay so me put those into
[53:51] words um the variance era the very first
[53:54] one is probably the beginning of the
[53:56] live era and then in 24 that's the end
[54:00] of the dead ball era going into more
[54:03] live ball
[54:04] era um 54 is basically um changes in
[54:11] philosophy of the game um and how the
[54:13] Umpire and how you manage um I can talk
[54:17] more about that
[54:18] specifically um and then 1993 is a lot
[54:21] of expansion time of the
[54:23] 90s something the 90s um
[54:27] and then basically
[54:29] 2009 there's um changes in the strike
[54:34] zone um reductions of walks and honestly
[54:37] I would kind of call this the more data
[54:38] driven one like now that we have more
[54:42] understanding well how are we changing
[54:44] the game differently to adapt to what
[54:46] will score us runs or make us one the so
[54:51] this is overall baseball changes and
[54:53] these are really good results because
[54:54] the people who have done this with one
[54:57] um statistic this matches up with what
[54:59] we saw before so this is a little bit
[55:02] done before but it's good that we're
[55:03] getting similar results to what people
[55:06] have talked about and what has been done
[55:07] before but we did it looking at all of
[55:09] these statistics
[55:12] together so this one is the metric
[55:16] specific um and so every single team the
[55:19] 16 teams are kind of printed and great
[55:21] and then I just highlighted the average
[55:23] with variability on top um um and so you
[55:28] can kind of see that attendance has been
[55:29] growing like I really feel like this to
[55:32] here is where it became like aerican
[55:35] time in terms of attendance um and he
[55:38] can look like this is right about the
[55:40] end of the war really became very
[55:42] popular and has been boring ever since
[55:44] and then actually this obviously dropped
[55:46] off because of Co um and I'm really
[55:48] curious to actually see what happens in
[55:50] terms of attendance they've been
[55:51] changing like Stadium sizes um and like
[55:55] you can't fill it up the way that you
[55:56] used to
[55:59] before um the other interesting one is
[56:02] obviously home runs and I think this one
[56:04] is the most volatile it has the most me
[56:07] and variance changes so when you look at
[56:09] these just kind of think about like I a
[56:11] flat line across them how they're kind
[56:13] of going up or down or a lot of
[56:15] variability in all of
[56:18] them um so I I can talk more about that
[56:22] in a second um but like walks and runs
[56:25] changing about the same period of time
[56:28] Chang the game of like how you're
[56:30] pitching how you're trying to get people
[56:32] out of Base things like that um similar
[56:35] time period with strikeouts and solid
[56:42] bases oh doing get our of time okay so a
[56:46] lot of the um home runs so live ball era
[56:52] postwar stuff changes to the mound
[56:55] changes to steroid use or non-steroid
[56:58] use um and then this kind of more recent
[57:01] change about how we are getting home
[57:03] runs differently than we had in the past
[57:06] using probably more
[57:08] data um runs kind of end of the dead
[57:13] ball 1940s um integration era bringing
[57:16] more people in
[57:19] um stolen bases strikeouts a lot of
[57:22] things have to deal basically with how
[57:25] the game is being played
[57:26] so back to those kind of eras of
[57:28] baseball overall are still fitting into
[57:30] these individual measures of the
[57:34] statistics um okay then this one is the
[57:37] best graphic I think I've ever made um
[57:41] so for each of these there's 10
[57:43] statistics going on within a single team
[57:47] and I couldn't show you every single
[57:49] change point and every single thing on
[57:50] it that's 32 * 10 that's too much stuff
[57:53] to look at so what this is is basically
[57:55] the bands are the existence of the team
[57:59] so if it's really short that's really
[58:00] hard to detect change points because you
[58:02] have to determine where those brakes are
[58:04] happening and if it's really long you
[58:06] can see they've been around for a long
[58:07] time and then a circle is a change in
[58:10] the me and a diamond is or triangle as a
[58:14] change in the
[58:15] variance um and then I use breaks like
[58:18] team colors package um so they all match
[58:20] the colors of the team and looks very
[58:24] fancy it took a lot of work but I really
[58:26] like this visual um because you can kind
[58:29] of see especially up and down where like
[58:32] teams get added
[58:34] in how there's change points right
[58:37] around the same time because you're
[58:38] adding more players in you're adding
[58:41] more teams and so it's going to create
[58:43] this kind of like pressure change of
[58:45] like now we have dynastes now we have
[58:47] collapses because there's just more
[58:49] there to play with um and so since here
[58:54] Austin red a couple change points even
[58:57] more recent one change in
[58:58] variability B one
[59:01] though um so some highlights to pull
[59:05] out
[59:11] um okay I'm doing so like in the 90s
[59:15] 1990 uh the Braves had a change point
[59:19] where they had a lot of early
[59:21] success um in like lots of World Series
[59:25] and and um really they believe that that
[59:28] was due to really good pitching um
[59:32] cville and Guardians
[59:34] 1993 uh really good hitting team but
[59:37] fell short of winning the World Series
[59:38] during their Peak but they still kind of
[59:40] had like a dynasty shift there so they
[59:42] had a bunch of changes in all their
[59:44] metrics um the Rays uh transitioned from
[59:48] years of poor performance because
[59:49] they're in expansion team so they
[59:50] started they had some of the lower
[59:53] players they had a lot of
[59:54] variability and and then they moved into
[59:57] being really good really fast in one
[59:59] World Series um and so this was kind of
[60:01] like the birth of a dynasty here and
[60:05] then same thing with the Nationals and
[60:07] again these are franchises so when they
[60:10] move that's one franchise in this data
[60:13] set okay um but they basically were
[60:17] terrible and then got really good all of
[60:19] a sudden um after after their relocation
[60:24] and that uh sparked a kind of Dynasty
[60:26] change for them in a positive
[60:29] way um
[60:32] so overall we found a lot of the
[60:35] traditional eras that people
[60:37] hypothesized about um dead ball
[60:40] integration steroid posteroid even some
[60:43] more modern eras of like using data
[60:45] analytics and like changing the way the
[60:46] game is played a little bit and then
[60:49] classified some kind of dynasties for
[60:51] teams and I didn't really talk about the
[60:53] clients because that s of a moment I
[60:55] tried to good ones um and then basically
[60:59] I think this could be used all the time
[61:01] I'm already writing another paper right
[61:02] now with um competitive balance measures
[61:05] to see like when more competition leads
[61:08] to more changes in the game um but
[61:10] there's tons of uses to do this to other
[61:12] sports the only drawback is you just
[61:14] need a lot of time data so we looked at
[61:16] it every year so we needed you know 120
[61:19] years this pretty good place to start
[61:21] but other things like I tried to look at
[61:24] women's sports but there wasn't enough
[61:25] data but if I looked at it her game and
[61:27] I had a much gular um level of game over
[61:31] time you could also that as well so
[61:35] right for determining eras in the past
[61:37] and kind of saying what was coming out
[61:41] there
[61:43] so thank you
[61:50] question em um thank you that was
[61:54] awesome thinking about the talks
[61:56] recently about like some of the women's
[61:58] college basketball and like the CH in
[62:00] like um some of them Ed kind of the NBA
[62:03] did you find any change points that
[62:05] maybe like corresponded to timing of
[62:06] like generational talent and things like
[62:08] that that like end the week yeah I think
[62:10] this is too high level because it it's
[62:14] like especially for the team stuff it's
[62:17] about team performance where we kind of
[62:18] put like a positive and a negative so
[62:21] even if you're really good for like one
[62:23] or two years and that person like plays
[62:26] for the same team forever maybe that
[62:28] might create a dynasty but it has to be
[62:30] everyone from together so I think you
[62:33] could take this same idea I also thought
[62:35] about this within like really good
[62:37] players and like looking at their change
[62:39] points just like they did with bar Bond
[62:41] said the techero used to be like when
[62:43] were they in their like Heyday of doing
[62:47] stuff and I had a student actually
[62:49] propose when I was I presented this to
[62:51] him first he's exactly he's a senior
[62:54] about to graduate in our uh data science
[62:56] program and I was like what do you think
[62:57] what questions do you have and he was
[62:59] like oh I want to look at um almost like
[63:03] hot hands kind of stuff in basketball I
[63:06] was like that would be really
[63:07] interesting yeah that's a good question
[63:10] thank you yeah
[63:27] yes so none of this is causal that's a
[63:29] really really good question so this is
[63:30] why I was a satisfiction is I was like I
[63:33] can do all the math and I made all these
[63:35] pretty graphics for you and I was like
[63:37] now you have to go figure out what was
[63:39] happening at this time period so I work
[63:41] with Greg and Brian Mills who's at Texas
[63:44] um they know baseball a lot better than
[63:46] I did and so we just hypothesized what
[63:48] was changing around those times we're
[63:51] just saying this is when the data is
[63:52] telling us that it's changing um but
[63:55] they were always is really close to like
[63:57] changes in the picture mou changes to
[63:59] like rules of how they like did
[64:02] strikeouts or things like that um so
[64:04] they were always closely aligned and
[64:06] it's interesting to look at I look at
[64:08] change point for a lot of different
[64:09] things but it's kind of like if I
[64:10] implemented a policy it might not impact
[64:14] right away when I implement it it might
[64:16] impact two years later or if people are
[64:19] like uh thinking that the change will
[64:22] come they might change their strategy
[64:23] before and I can actually see a change
[64:25] before happens so that's kind of why we
[64:27] look at it like imper through the data
[64:29] and not say it's exactly this or it's
[64:31] exactly this it's kind of um here's what
[64:34] the data is saying and so we think these
[64:36] things but that's a really good question
[64:37] there's no Cal imprints of
[64:40] um change Point
[64:44] analysis yeah just so I like to talk lot
[64:47] like way it's pictured a small
[64:48] suggestion would be at the league level
[64:51] have the same plot with the different
[64:53] Commissioners underneath it so
[64:56] yeah we tried to look at it for um who
[64:58] owned the team as well because a lot of
[65:01] there's so much with the 32 teams
[65:03] because both of them had their own teams
[65:05] and they really looked into those and
[65:07] like determined those and that was
[65:08] something that we came up with um who
[65:12] own the team and then Commissioners as
[65:14] well that's that's a really good point I
[65:15] like that one as well because I think
[65:17] something in like
[65:20] the I can't remember but they they
[65:22] talked about this as well like the gold
[65:25] of
[65:27] the high level yeah yeah like just
[65:31] selfishly as a Yankee fan I saw like the
[65:34] I think that's when Steiner bought the
[65:35] team and it's a change Point yes and
[65:38] like an econ uh economics graphs a lot
[65:41] you'll see like Republican party tax
[65:42] rates go down yeah Democrats tax rates
[65:45] go up so just be interesting to see that
[65:47] that's very true I'm I'm pretty sure
[65:49] that's written in the paper that's why I
[65:50] remember this is is exactly that so I
[65:54] just pulled out a couple of highlights
[65:55] but then the paper we try to talk about
[65:56] as many of the teams as possible one
[66:00] last
[66:01] question okay um so I had a quick
[66:03] question when you were showing the uh
[66:05] your plots of each of the
[66:08] different um statistics one of the uh
[66:11] here this one here when you were looking
[66:14] at attendance were you count counting
[66:16] for population um at the time no no and
[66:19] that was the thing is that um when we
[66:22] looked at some of these like some of
[66:24] them were really high I was like that's
[66:26] crazy why are they so high is that um we
[66:30] don't know like per Stadium like what's
[66:32] the per Stadium size and they like uh
[66:35] with the ones in New York I think they
[66:37] just changed the city recently to CIT so
[66:39] there's no like um anything like that
[66:43] especially because teams so changeed
[66:45] locations over time so this was just
[66:47] kind of like raw attendance but but uh
[66:51] any kind of appropriation would be
[66:54] pretty good we did standardized by how
[66:56] many games were played what does that
[66:59] even kind of mean it's kind of just like
[67:01] a per game
[67:18] attendance our last speaker is Dr Dale
[67:22] Zimmerman from University of Iowa it's
[67:25] going to talk about pyrometric outline
[67:27] fitting to track the evolution of the F
[67:30] Strike Zone to the Major League Baseball
[67:32] from 2008 2023 let's give a warm Round
[67:36] of Applause to
[67:41] Dr okay so um my talks got some overtone
[67:46] similar to the previous talk in that I'm
[67:50] looking trying to explore what's
[67:52] happening over time I'm not looking for
[67:54] specific change points though and I
[67:56] focused only on one object the called
[67:59] strike zone as opposed to lots of
[68:02] different things in baseball um at the
[68:05] risk of telling you something you
[68:07] already know on these first couple
[68:08] slides here's a a formal definition of
[68:11] the of the strike zone from the official
[68:13] rules of
[68:14] baseball not going to read it so I'm
[68:17] going to show you a picture in just a
[68:20] second and then this is another part of
[68:22] it strike is a legal pment so-called by
[68:24] the Empire which if not struck at if if
[68:26] any part of the ball passes through any
[68:28] part of the strike zone and so here's a
[68:30] here's a picture okay so it's
[68:32] rectangular in shape and that's kind of
[68:35] our reference point for some of the
[68:38] called strike zones I've was showing you
[68:40] now I'm sure this comes as a great
[68:42] surprise to most to to all of you that
[68:44] umpires make mistakes on call pitches
[68:48] and may even adhere to a strike zone
[68:51] somewhat different than what the rule
[68:53] book specifies it should be
[68:55] and we call this alternative Strike Zone
[68:57] the called strike zone that's sort of a
[69:00] term that's been accepted now uh and
[69:04] it's defined Loosely for now I'll say as
[69:07] the largest smooth outline region
[69:09] containing those points in which a
[69:10] called pitch is more likely we called a
[69:12] strike from the ball I'll tell you how
[69:15] we actually
[69:16] formally determine it in a later slide
[69:20] but I want to point out that it's a
[69:21] fluid object it uh varies across time
[69:25] that's what I'm going to focus on today
[69:26] varies across pitchers pitchers have
[69:29] different strike zones called strike
[69:30] zones batters umpires that's a really
[69:33] interesting phenomenon you can study the
[69:36] called strike zones of specific umpires
[69:38] you know some call the the the outside
[69:43] on the left side of the plate uh pitch a
[69:45] strike more often than others so it's
[69:48] interesting to compare different umpires
[69:51] game situations affect the call Strike
[69:54] Zone greatly um when the count is full
[69:59] or when I'm sorry when it's a it's a a
[70:02] 30 Count Strike Zone expands drastically
[70:06] U from what it is
[70:09] when at other counts our Focus today
[70:12] will be on changes in the called strike
[70:14] zone over time and so here's a graphic
[70:17] that shows you read left to right down
[70:19] the page just like you would reading a
[70:21] book to see the timeline and you can see
[70:24] that in 2008 when data were first
[70:27] collected of this time or data were
[70:29] first Avail widely available um of this
[70:32] phenomenon the strike zone called strike
[70:36] zone was a rather SWAT object it was
[70:39] wide not so tall as time went on it got
[70:42] taller and less
[70:44] wide and in recent
[70:47] years up to 2022 it's now visually at
[70:51] least in Fairly good conformance with
[70:54] the uh rule book strikes some I I put
[70:58] boxes up there for reference the uh
[71:01] horizontal I mean vertical lines are
[71:04] well defined by
[71:07] the rule book strikes own definition the
[71:10] upper and lower lines are determined by
[71:12] the batter and so those aren't fixed for
[71:14] each batter but these are shown which
[71:17] the ones that are shown are averaged
[71:18] overall batters that came to that and
[71:21] that well that that were had called
[71:23] strikes on strikes called on them in
[71:27] that uh that
[71:29] year so it appears that the called
[71:31] strike zone got taller and narrower over
[71:34] time but how can we attach some measures
[71:37] of statistical significance to that um
[71:42] and is the called strike zone becoming
[71:45] measurably more like the rule book
[71:46] Strike Zone visually it certainly seems
[71:48] to
[71:49] be so we developed methodology for
[71:52] addressing these questions using the
[71:54] available data
[71:56] um over the nine-year period from 2008
[71:59] to
[72:00] 2016 the system that collected the data
[72:03] was called the pitch FX system and then
[72:06] uh it was switched over to the trackman
[72:08] system uh from 2017 to
[72:11] 20122 basically it changed from cameras
[72:14] to
[72:16] radar stop the radar but and and the
[72:20] locations of the cameras is different
[72:23] than the location of the radar but it's
[72:25] all accepted and it's part of the
[72:26] official Major League Baseball data
[72:29] that's available to anybody that wants
[72:30] it
[72:33] now over the period we consider this
[72:35] 15-year period there were roughly five
[72:38] million called pitches corresponding to
[72:41] several thousand pitchers and batters
[72:42] and about 200 home plate
[72:45] umpires of those nearly five billion
[72:49] called pitches a little over two-thirds
[72:51] were called balls and the rest were
[72:52] called strikes and that ratio that
[72:56] breakdown has been very uh constant
[72:59] consistent over
[73:01] years of the called balls about 5% were
[73:07] incorrectly called they were inside the
[73:08] rule book Strife zone of the called
[73:12] strikes more than 22% were outside The
[73:15] Rook strike zone so that the the
[73:19] misclassifications are more with the um
[73:23] pitches that should have been called
[73:24] balls that they called
[73:26] strikes and overall umpires
[73:29] misclassified about 10% of the called
[73:31] pitches over this 15year period but it's
[73:34] not been constant over time their uh
[73:39] accuracy has improved quite a vent and
[73:42] very
[73:43] steadily no no major change point there
[73:46] it's a it's very consistent
[73:49] Evolution both in the um misclassified
[73:53] balls and the mclassified stripes are
[73:55] both going down even just last year well
[73:59] the last year of the uh shown here which
[74:02] is
[74:03] 2022 um there was a very large drop in
[74:06] the proportion of of uh pitches that
[74:10] were called incorrectly as
[74:14] strikes so when this will end nobody
[74:17] knows but it's ongoing hasn't hasn't
[74:20] stopped yet now accuracy isn't
[74:22] everything right um fans and managers
[74:24] will tolerate some lack of accuracy as
[74:27] long as a umpire is consistent in what
[74:30] they call so not too long ago uh people
[74:34] started looking at this data with
[74:36] respect to Within game
[74:39] consistency and U one measure of Within
[74:43] game consistency is shown here that the
[74:47] basically you're subtracting from one
[74:50] the ratio of the number of balls within
[74:51] the convex hole of called strikes over
[74:54] the total number of called
[74:56] balls so it focuses on the on the called
[74:59] balls and any you're inside the the
[75:02] Umpire strike zone for that game as
[75:05] determined by the convex hole that's a
[75:07] Mis that's regarded as an inconsistent
[75:12] pitch so here's just an example from one
[75:15] game broken down by right-handers and
[75:19] leanders and the uh right-handers there
[75:22] were no inconsistencies called by the
[75:24] Umpire in that game but on the
[75:26] left-handers there was one ball that was
[75:29] inside the convex ball so how is this
[75:32] consistency measured trending over time
[75:34] well just like accuracy it's been
[75:36] improving a lot too improving
[75:40] steadily so these these are all good
[75:43] things right there's been some clamor
[75:45] for um for the baseball to get rid of
[75:48] umpires and make it an automated system
[75:50] and everything
[75:52] um they could
[75:53] argue Major League Baseball could argue
[75:56] well things are improving so your your
[75:58] arguments don't have as much
[76:00] U import perhaps now let me show these
[76:05] outlines again I want to tell you um
[76:09] where they're coming from and what we're
[76:11] going to do with them because I'm not
[76:13] just I'm not quite satisfied just with
[76:15] an overall accuracy and overall
[76:18] consistency Trend I want to see what's
[76:20] happening actually to the strike zone to
[76:22] its geometry at a finer scale so what
[76:25] these outlines are are outlines that are
[76:28] determined by applying a a discriminant
[76:31] analysis procedure basically Cal density
[76:34] based on the horizontal and vertical
[76:38] coordinates of all called pitches in
[76:40] that year and the outline determines
[76:43] where a pitch is more likely to be
[76:46] called a strike than a ball that's the
[76:49] Shaded region and the outside regions
[76:51] what it's more likely to be called a
[76:52] ball than a strike
[76:55] and as you saw the called strike zone
[76:58] was not centered on the rulebook Strike
[77:00] Zone it's historically been shifted
[77:03] slightly left although um it's as I'll
[77:08] argue in a minute it's re about spot on
[77:12] now in terms of its horizontal
[77:16] shift it was considerably wider at its
[77:18] widest point uh than the rule book
[77:21] Strike Zone that's still slightly true
[77:23] but not as much as as we'll see and the
[77:26] shape is not
[77:28] rectangular the edges are curved so it's
[77:30] not conforming to the rule book Stripes
[77:33] own shape which is supposed to be a
[77:36] rectangle furthermore the upper
[77:39] margin the upper out part of the outline
[77:42] the upper half of the outline is more
[77:43] rounded than the bottom
[77:45] half you can convince yourself of that
[77:48] if you tilt your head upside down and
[77:49] then it really pops out at you that the
[77:52] the bottom half is more straight across
[77:54] there than the upper half
[77:57] is so what's the shape of this region
[78:01] well it's not rectangular it's all it's
[78:03] somewhat
[78:04] elliptical but because it has this
[78:07] um this more rounded sorry more rounded
[78:11] Corners it falls into the family of what
[78:13] are called super
[78:15] ellipses more rounded than a rectangle
[78:18] but less rounded than a than an ellipse
[78:20] actually it falls into the family of
[78:22] what are called super ellipses
[78:24] and some years ago when I was a graduate
[78:27] student working in a at Iowa State in
[78:30] their egg experiment station I had done
[78:32] some work with some
[78:34] biologists they do this stuff called
[78:36] morphometric analysis where they're
[78:38] trying to study the shapes of objects
[78:40] like the shapes of uh skulls of animals
[78:44] or the wings of insects or something
[78:46] like that and then they try to you know
[78:48] classify or figure out the evolution of
[78:51] these these uh animals over time
[78:55] using these shapes and things within
[78:58] Genera to compare the the shapes so I it
[79:03] occurred to me I could use borrow some
[79:05] of those ideas to study the outline of
[79:08] the called strike zone what you have to
[79:11] do is digitize the outline and then
[79:14] somehow quantify the geometric
[79:16] information in the
[79:18] outline and once you Quantified that
[79:20] geometric information then I'm going to
[79:23] plot that versus year and then carry out
[79:25] a simple
[79:26] non-parametric uh T test for time uh
[79:29] Trend to see if there's been a
[79:32] significant change in those at geometric
[79:35] attributes over
[79:38] time specifically the model that I fit
[79:41] was a super elliptic model or a more
[79:43] generalized version
[79:46] um there's many different models have
[79:49] been proposed some are non-parametric
[79:51] the elliptic 4A models are sometimes
[79:54] used
[79:55] uh but this particular super generalized
[79:57] super elliptic model called The
[79:59] Atlas um that's an acronym for hold on
[80:03] for it
[80:05] asymmetrically transform no apine
[80:08] transformed latitudinally asymmetric
[80:11] superellipse by saying that real fast
[80:14] two
[80:15] times apine transformed means it it
[80:18] allows some skew it doesn't have to be
[80:21] you know oriented straight up and down
[80:23] it can have some skew to it
[80:25] latitudinally asymmetric means the top
[80:27] half can be more rounded than the bottom
[80:31] half and then it's super ellipse so
[80:34] here's a basic equation of a super
[80:36] ellipse if um put put in rals 1 there
[80:41] and you would have the equation of an
[80:42] ellipse right with X knot and Y knot
[80:45] being the center of the ellipse and a
[80:47] being the width and B being the
[80:50] height um or half half width and half
[80:53] height actually but but uh so that' be
[80:56] an ellipse but that R is a parameter
[80:58] that controls how rectangular the object
[81:01] is it's a
[81:03] rectangularity index and so you can get
[81:05] objects that range from the ellip the
[81:07] top look at the top line here an ellipse
[81:11] to a a rectangle depending on the
[81:13] magnitude of that R and the strike zone
[81:16] is more kind of like something in the
[81:18] middle two there but also it had a
[81:21] little bit of skew to it so it's it
[81:23] needs to we need to take care of that
[81:26] and it had a more rounded top like the
[81:27] things on the the right hand bottom
[81:30] there more rounded top than uh than the
[81:33] bottom Edge okay so that's what we need
[81:36] this this Atlas model for adds a couple
[81:39] more parameters but is more flexible to
[81:43] fit what visually the called strike zone
[81:45] looks like so this um this model has a a
[81:50] sheer parameter s that allows for that
[81:53] slant
[81:54] and then it has two distinct
[81:57] rectangularity indexes one for the top
[81:59] half one for the bottom
[82:01] half and that model just fits great it
[82:04] really it's almost impossible to see any
[82:08] discrepancy between some of the called
[82:11] strike zone pictures there and the best
[82:14] fitting generalized super lips this this
[82:17] Atlas
[82:19] model and all of these parameters are
[82:21] readily interpretable that's the beauty
[82:23] of this this model as opposed to some of
[82:24] the others that have been proposed okay
[82:28] so this plot I need to explain it a
[82:30] little bit it shows the time trend of
[82:32] each of the each of the parameters so
[82:34] starting in the upper left that's the
[82:36] horizontal center of the called Strife
[82:38] Zone and you see that except for a kind
[82:41] of
[82:44] a glitch in 2009 there's been a steady
[82:47] Trend towards the middle of the strike
[82:50] zone so that's been improving over time
[82:53] the vertical
[82:55] Center is next to that in the top row
[82:57] the middle one in the top row that's
[82:59] been steadily improving although maybe
[83:01] leveling off uh these only this these
[83:04] plots only go up to 2016 not up to
[83:08] 2022 um and then the a is the half width
[83:12] of the uh super ellipse and that's
[83:16] steadily been uh decreasing over
[83:20] time to where it's actually gotten a
[83:22] little bit narrower than the
[83:24] um rule book Strike Zone rule book
[83:27] Strike Zone's width is 1.0 there we
[83:30] surpassed it a little bit uh the next
[83:32] the first one in the middle row is the
[83:35] vertical half RIT width that's been
[83:39] increasing and it's shot past what the
[83:43] um vertical height of the average
[83:46] rulebook strike zone
[83:49] is I think I'll go down to the bottom
[83:51] row the the the R1 and the R2 there
[83:54] those are the rectangularity indexes
[83:57] those have both been increasing over
[83:59] time which means the corners the the
[84:02] four corners of the strik called strike
[84:04] zone have been well four corners of the
[84:07] rule book Strike Zone have been filling
[84:09] in with the T Strike Zone the called
[84:12] Strike Zone's been becoming more
[84:14] rectangular U and filling in those empty
[84:18] spots in the corners that used to be
[84:20] there so that's a great thing um the
[84:22] sheer parameter on the bottom right
[84:24] hasn't changed much so all parameters
[84:27] except height area and Shear have gotten
[84:30] closer to the values for the rulebook
[84:32] Strike
[84:34] Zone these are just plots again I
[84:37] haven't produced anous plots and trends
[84:39] for the the last six years here I had
[84:42] hoped to by this meeting but I didn't
[84:44] didn't get it done but I'm sure what I'm
[84:47] going to see is the shift of the called
[84:49] strike zone to the right is continued uh
[84:51] to the point where it's almost centered
[84:53] on the center of the plate now now and
[84:55] if you look at 2022 there's no tilt to
[84:59] that at all the shear is gone and I'm
[85:02] sure I'll see that but one thing that's
[85:05] interesting is that the high strike is
[85:07] being called more
[85:09] now and so there's a little bit of an
[85:12] extension above the rule book Strike
[85:14] Zone that didn't used to didn't used to
[85:16] be
[85:18] there so
[85:21] conclusions statistical analyses confirm
[85:24] what Baseball fans have said for a long
[85:26] time the uh called strike zone and the
[85:29] rule book Strike Zone differ
[85:30] significantly called strike zone is not
[85:32] rectangular and has changed
[85:34] significantly over time the atlas model
[85:37] fits it very well and the nice thing
[85:39] about that model is that its geometric
[85:41] features are readily interpretable so we
[85:44] can say specifically that the width has
[85:47] changed or not or the shears changed or
[85:51] not or the rectangularity changed or not
[85:53] those sorts of aspects I think are
[85:55] interesting to comment on about the uh
[85:59] called strike
[86:01] zone um the height and area of the
[86:05] strike zone have increased a little bit
[86:07] over time those are the things that have
[86:10] and runs scored per game are strongly
[86:12] negatively correlated with the area of
[86:13] called strike zone excuse me so over
[86:17] that period from 2008 to 2016 where the
[86:21] area was really increasing runs per game
[86:23] did go down now I think that's just an
[86:26] association I don't can't prove that's
[86:29] positive you
[86:31] know not something that should surprise
[86:34] us and improvements in Empire
[86:36] performance since 2008 have been
[86:39] remarkable if you ask me I think the
[86:41] institution of this feedback system to
[86:43] the umpires has really been helpful in
[86:45] improving their performance at some
[86:48] point though it's got to level off right
[86:49] I mean they there's an upper bound on
[86:52] how accurate they could be so um you
[86:55] know 100% accuracy so at some point it's
[86:57] got to level off and I'm just curious to
[86:59] know whether that'll happen in my
[87:02] lifetime or or not so we'll
[87:06] see if you want to see the um kind of
[87:09] the results up to
[87:11] 2016 that that first paper there has
[87:13] more details on this and then we're
[87:16] writing a paper with u with the more
[87:18] recent
[87:19] results as soon as we get them as the
[87:22] second paper here so thank you for your
[87:28] attention for Dr
[87:31] Zimmer yeah this might be a dumb
[87:33] question but how much of the rounding is
[87:36] due to the fact ball is
[87:40] round yeah so the question was how much
[87:42] of the rounding is due to the fact that
[87:45] the outline is round
[87:46] itself um I don't know I mean the the a
[87:51] ball is called a strike if any part of
[87:53] the ball
[87:54] touches
[87:56] the it's supposed to be called a strike
[87:58] if any part of the ball touches the rule
[88:00] book strik
[88:01] on
[88:03] um I don't know if that addresses your
[88:06] question or not so in the bottom of the
[88:09] stri yeah what uh what's that edge is it
[88:13] like the center of the ball or is it no
[88:17] it's the edge of the ball it's any part
[88:19] of the ball touching okay so that so
[88:21] that bottom left rounded part that the
[88:23] very top right of the baseball correct
[88:26] got
[88:27] it your guess is as good as mine I don't
[88:29] know if the shape of the ball
[88:31] actually makes that difference I think
[88:33] more what makes the edges rounded is the
[88:36] tendency I think people have done some
[88:38] psychological tests on this people tend
[88:40] to smooth things over when they make
[88:44] when they make Falls of things not just
[88:46] on strikes but they tend to report
[88:49] objects as being more rounded than they
[88:51] actually
[88:53] were formula wise doesn't have any what
[88:57] formula is just the very edge points
[89:01] yeah yeah
[89:04] yeah I don't know much about baseball
[89:07] but my question has to do with the math
[89:10] so you in in your so estimated the
[89:13] parameters R1 R2 s how did you do that
[89:17] you observe XY right right for each year
[89:20] okay but but you have to have a lost
[89:22] function yeah yeah so I I glossed over
[89:26] that b squares B squares is how we did
[89:30] it there's there are available
[89:32] algorithms out there for fitting
[89:35] outlines to Curves by minimizing the sum
[89:37] of square deviations from the normals to
[89:41] those
[89:42] curves yeah so this yeah I good question
[89:47] yeah so so the observe minus whatever
[89:51] the the function is squ
[90:02] I think my question was similar to his
[90:03] is like should it naturally be more
[90:05] rounded because when you think about
[90:07] like noise like a lot of the change
[90:09] stuff I do is is about what detecting
[90:11] noises and when you look at noise
[90:14] especially like a spatial sense it's
[90:15] more circular like just Randomness
[90:18] should come more circularly if like
[90:20] you're trying to hit it right at the
[90:21] middle so like I can like should they
[90:24] even have those little Corners like in
[90:26] the stri zone like should they do you
[90:29] think like they should just actually
[90:30] make it more circular do I think the
[90:34] poers to speed in baseball to change the
[90:36] shape with the rule book Strike Zone
[90:38] like like conservative in that aspect
[90:41] want baseball to change yeah do those
[90:45] Corners even matter because like
[90:46] naturally maybe this is a mathematical
[90:48] physics question because like what does
[90:50] it mean to go like if you're trying to
[90:51] shoot for the dead middle that corner
[90:54] seems
[90:55] unnatural right unless you're trying to
[90:58] aim for the qu because it's the hardest
[91:00] spot to hit
[91:03] oh still time to take question
[91:14] okay without doing what
[91:36] ex you got a rectangle you just put the
[91:38] ball right you know it's tangent right
[91:42] the
[91:43] corner not just so it touches the corner
[91:46] yeah it wouldn't be tangent one last
[91:48] Yeah you mentioned the differences
[91:49] between umpires did you look at any
[91:52] umpire transformation over time like
[91:54] specific to individual umpires no we
[91:57] didn't look at specific umpire
[91:58] Transformations over time that would be
[92:00] fun to do yeah see you know if
[92:03] individual umpires especially those that
[92:06] were um older had been in the league
[92:08] longer were less they were more stubborn
[92:11] and less willing to to to to make these
[92:14] changes over time yeah or if any of even
[92:17] got work we've studied whether that's
[92:18] the case with resp to with respect to
[92:21] overall accuracy but not on these
[92:24] individual geometric attributes and they
[92:26] are more stubborn Yeah the more
[92:29] experienced umpires actually performed
[92:32] were were less the the less wellbe
[92:35] performing ones as as time went on
