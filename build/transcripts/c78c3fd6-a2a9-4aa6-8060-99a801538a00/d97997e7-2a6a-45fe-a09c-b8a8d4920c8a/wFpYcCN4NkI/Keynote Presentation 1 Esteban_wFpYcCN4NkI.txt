[00:01] good morning everyone uh welcome to the
[00:05] fifth Yukan Sports analytics Symposium
[00:08] on behalf of uh my co-organizers Greg
[00:11] Matthews and Brian McDonald's and the
[00:14] department of Statistics at Yukon uh
[00:17] welcome to the beautiful Campus of the
[00:19] repeated NCAA basketball champion um my
[00:23] name is Jun Yen I'm the one of the
[00:26] organizers of this
[00:28] conference uh since 2019 we have been
[00:32] doing this conference and many of you
[00:34] may know that the unique The Shining
[00:37] feature of this conference is our focus
[00:39] on students and you've been to
[00:42] conference that charges registrations
[00:45] close to
[00:46] $1,000 and how much do we charge and
[00:49] have you seen any uh conference Sports
[00:51] analytic conference that are less
[00:54] expensive than us uh if so that's
[00:56] probably us the two years ago right
[01:00] um
[01:02] well uh without further Ado Let's uh get
[01:04] started we have uh uh several people who
[01:07] will give opening remarks first
[01:11] Professor ofer Harel the dean of college
[01:14] of liberal arts and sciences and
[01:26] Yan thank you Jun um
[01:30] I'm not used to do it with papers I'm
[01:32] new to that rooll I used to be the one
[01:35] who is sitting over there in the back
[01:37] and doing that research
[01:39] so thank you June good morning everyone
[01:42] I'm happy to be here today to kick off
[01:45] this uh great Yukon Sports analytics
[01:48] Symposium with all of you
[01:50] today um it's an exciting time to dive
[01:53] into the intersection of sport and data
[01:56] here at
[01:57] Yukon um we of course very proud of both
[02:02] the men's basketball team who brought
[02:05] home the national champions two years in
[02:07] a row and the women basketball team who
[02:10] this year made it to the final
[02:13] four um with half of the roster so um
[02:20] although I say it once and I'll uh I
[02:23] would let it go I don't think there was
[02:25] a foul over
[02:27] there um
[02:30] but it's moments like these uh they
[02:34] remind us why we love sports through
[02:36] both the Thrills and heart
[02:40] breaks when this Symposium started
[02:43] 2019 the organizers wanted to make
[02:46] Sports analytics more accessible for
[02:49] students they wanted to break down those
[02:52] barriers that often keep students from
[02:54] getting into this field whether it's
[02:57] technical jargon the cost or or just
[03:00] finding a seat in the
[03:03] room since then the conference has
[03:05] become a game
[03:07] Cher we've been able to Showcase Sports
[03:10] analytics in ways that's easy to
[03:12] understand we've given students the
[03:14] tools they need to Crunch the numbers
[03:17] and we fostered some great
[03:18] collaborations between Academia and the
[03:21] sports
[03:22] industry sport analytics is about
[03:25] finding those insights that can
[03:27] literally change the game where it's
[03:30] help whether it's helping coaches to
[03:32] make smarter decisions predicting
[03:35] players performance or even rizing the F
[03:39] experiences the possibilities are
[03:42] endless these kinds of applications of
[03:45] data to Human Experience are
[03:48] cornerstones to the College of Liberal
[03:49] Arts and Sciences we want people to
[03:52] learn a c disciplines to apply ideas
[03:55] from one field to another and broaden
[03:57] the many perspective that that are
[04:00] brought into
[04:02] research to all the students here today
[04:05] I want to say your passion and curiosity
[04:09] are what's going to take this field to
[04:11] the next level make sure to ask
[04:13] questions and talk to some new people
[04:16] today to our faculty and Industry
[04:19] Partners I want to give big thank you
[04:22] without your support and expertise none
[04:24] of this would be
[04:26] possible so let's get going this great
[04:29] symposium and thank you for having
[04:32] me thank
[04:36] you uh next we will have Andrea hoodi
[04:39] director of sports performance women's
[04:41] basketball
[04:47] Yukon good morning um thank you for
[04:50] having me um my situation is a little
[04:53] bit different than I think most of yours
[04:55] I've been in the uh practical applied
[04:57] field for 30 years and I work for Coach
[05:01] ariemma who has been coaching for 40
[05:03] years very successfully 11 national
[05:06] championships without
[05:09] data right so I come in three years ago
[05:12] and I'm like hey coach we have all this
[05:14] technology we have X Y and Z can we
[05:17] start crunching the numbers I put
[05:19] together a group of students in the back
[05:21] that we crunch all these numbers of the
[05:23] data that we're collecting which I'll
[05:25] show you later um but just on another
[05:29] note be careful right because my quote
[05:32] that I got was well hoody my eye doesn't
[05:36] match your
[05:37] data it doesn't it does not match your
[05:40] data but my data is very important and
[05:43] as I as he mentioned earlier we made it
[05:45] to a final four with six players and the
[05:49] data that we collected had an impact on
[05:52] how far we went because I don't think we
[05:54] could have made it that far without the
[05:56] data that we've collected so data is
[05:58] super important and I do encourage you
[06:00] guys to ask questions get involved uh be
[06:04] students of the game um the Practical
[06:07] part of what we do is really important
[06:10] and the data is really important so
[06:12] those are almost two different things
[06:14] but um I would tell you that the data
[06:16] saved us this year so welcome and thank
[06:19] you for having
[06:24] me next uh is Elliot Schatz uh he's the
[06:29] direct uh uh performance Innovation lead
[06:32] at US Olympic and Paralympics
[06:39] committee good morning everyone I'm
[06:41] gonna refer to my notes to make sure I
[06:43] Express gratitude for all the people who
[06:46] deserve it um basically the theme of
[06:48] what I'm going to say this morning is
[06:50] just gratitude and thank you um so first
[06:53] I want to say thank you to June um for
[06:55] organizing the Symposium and inviting me
[06:56] to be a part of it uh as well as Brian
[06:59] McDonald uh professor at Yale and Greg
[07:02] Matthews professor at loyal in Chicago
[07:05] so they gave me the opportunity to join
[07:08] them in organizing the data challenge
[07:09] for this Symposium so I'm the one that
[07:11] proposed it and I'm really excited about
[07:15] the amazing work that so many of you did
[07:17] we had 30 student teams submit projects
[07:20] which was unbelievable like exceeded my
[07:23] wildest dreams and the quality of the
[07:26] work was just amazing so thank you to
[07:27] all the students who worked on it thank
[07:29] you to the professors who encouraged
[07:31] them and supported and coached them we
[07:34] we at the usopc we are not funded by the
[07:37] government so we're a relatively small
[07:40] But Mighty organization with a big brand
[07:43] so we really rely on talented people
[07:45] like you across the country to support
[07:48] our efforts and support Team USA so

[08:28] focus of this symposium you know the the
[08:30] quality of the work is amazing but the
[08:32] fact that students are really encouraged
[08:35] to attend and submit work and present
[08:37] posters it's just outstanding I love
[08:39] that aspect of this and the uh the three
[08:42] finalists in The undergraduate High
[08:44] School category and the graduate student
[08:46] category for the data challenge are

[08:57] amazing um the other person I need to
[08:59] Express gratitude to is zaang min so
[09:02] zaang please raise your hand so zaang
[09:04] made the data challenge possible by
[09:07] creating the data set so I basically
[09:09] sent him a whole bunch of PDFs which is
[09:12] really typical in international sports
[09:14] and zfun scraped them all uh with a ton
[09:18] of effort and created the data set that
[09:21] you used for the project so zaun thank
[09:23] you so much for your great work and I'll
[09:26] stop there but thank you so much for
[09:27] having me
[09:33] um Brian McDonald's is one of the

[09:42] was at ESPN and he's a important figure
[09:44] of this uh conference he's been shairing
[09:46] the poster sessions and the data
[09:49] challenge sessions and he's done tons of
[09:51] work uh now at Yale Brian and uh Brian
[09:55] has educated so many uh students in
[09:58] statistic and data science the poster
[10:00] sessions today we will see we will see
[10:02] many uh entries many participants uh
[10:05] poster presenters from Yale
[10:09] right thank you June good to be here
[10:12] again um for is it the fifth I don't
[10:16] know how many we've done because we
[10:17] skipped a year also and switch the
[10:18] timing but and maybe maybe the fifth
[10:21] Yukon Sports analytics Symposium um yeah
[10:26] great to be here today uh very excited
[10:28] for all of the presentations and as
[10:30] Elliot was talking about all the posters
[10:32] that we have uh at lunchtime from 12: to
[10:35] 2 please check all those out uh lots of
[10:38] good work there um I just wanted to take
[10:41] a moment to introduce um this initiative
[10:44] that several um people are working on
[10:47] it's called score uh which stands for
[10:49] sports content for outreach uh research
[10:52] and education and um it's basically uh
[10:56] the focus is sort of um building a
[11:00] sustainable national network that uh
[11:02] creates um content that can be used in
[11:05] classrooms and workshops and so on that
[11:09] basically the the aim is to use Sports
[11:11] to get students interested in data
[11:13] Science Education who might not
[11:14] otherwise get interest in data science
[11:17] education so if you have any interest in
[11:20] uh I mean I this is like the shortest
[11:22] intro I've ever done of this initiative
[11:24] or maybe anyone has ever done if you
[11:26] want more information oh can we move
[11:28] that
[11:29] there um uh a website scor network.org
[11:35] um there's this email address if you're
[11:37] interested in being involved scor
[11:39] Network org Gmail and then there's the
[11:42] uh X Twitter and Linkedin uh handles
[11:45] also scor network.org um if also if you
[11:48] want to hear a little bit more about it
[11:50] you can come talk to me you can also
[11:52] come talk with Michael Shuckers the
[11:53] handsome young gentleman over here um
[11:57] who will be filming videos of some of
[11:59] our speakers today uh at various times
[12:01] during the day just sort of uh asking
[12:04] them question little mini interviews to
[12:06] help motivate some of the modules that
[12:08] we'll create um through this the score
[12:11] Network so there will be um sort of
[12:13] written content but then a lot of these
[12:16] modules will have uh video introductions
[12:18] to them so he's uh working on that a
[12:20] little bit
[12:21] today and yeah that is it thank you and
[12:27] uh uh welcome to the conference and
[12:31] enjoy
[12:34] it thank you Brian this concludes our
[12:37] welcoming remarks uh Greg your
[12:48] show coming in hot uh good morning
[12:51] everyone um so I'm gonna introduce the
[12:53] first speaker but before I do I'd like
[12:55] to reiterate what what Elliot said about
[12:58] uh if you're a student come talk to us
[13:00] um I feel like I've been to conferences
[13:02] before in like with other fields and I
[13:03] remember being a student and I walked up
[13:05] to someone and I would be like hey I
[13:06] really like your work and they were like
[13:08] ah I got to go to lunch or whatever and
[13:09] they kind of ignored me and I'll never
[13:11] forget who they were I won't say who
[13:12] they were but I remember who they were
[13:13] and I'll always remember it but it's not
[13:15] like that in sports like every
[13:16] conference I've ever been to everyone
[13:18] wants to talk to you it's super friendly
[13:20] it's kind of not like other sort of
[13:22] subfields of Statistics but like
[13:23] literally everyone here will talk to you
[13:25] and don't don't be shy just go ask
[13:27] questions all right so meet everyone one
[13:29] that's kind of the point of this thing
[13:30] is to meet people um at this conference
[13:32] all right uh I'm now going to introduce
[13:34] the first Speaker am I doing okay okay
[13:37] good
[13:39] um June taught me math stat he's one of
[13:41] the greatest professors I've ever had
[13:43] you're were pretty good toer all
[13:45] right all right uh I'll introduce the
[13:47] first Speaker uh Esteban Navaro gayes is
[13:49] a technical product manager for the
[13:51] baseball team at zeis analytics a role
[13:53] in which he collaborates closely with a
[13:55] team of 20 data scientists and Engineers
[13:57] overseeing the development and
[13:58] implementation of the team's road map
[14:00] supporting client integration and
[14:02] mentoring junior team members before
[14:04] joining zealous analytics Esteban spent
[14:06] two years as a quanitative analyst with
[14:07] the Los Angeles Dodgers winning the
[14:09] World Series in 2020 we can clap for
[14:11] that yeah I'd say
[14:13] so he graduated with a master's degree
[14:16] in data science from New York University
[14:18] uh where he is a deep mind fellow in a
[14:19] full bright Garcia Robel scholarship
[14:21] recipient let's uh let's welcome Este on
[14:23] uh to the stage
[14:32] good morning all how are we doing I know
[14:34] it's early you can do better than that
[14:35] come on hard to hard to follow gret with
[14:39] that energy but I'll I'll give it a shot
[14:41] um I'm very happy to be here I'd like to
[14:44] take a second to ask for another round
[14:46] of applause for the organizing committee
[14:48] I think um
[14:51] yeah you know the mission of making a
[14:54] student driven and student focused
[14:57] conference is not lust on me
[14:59] um I grew up in Mexico and I didn't
[15:01] really have a lot of access to these
[15:03] opportunities so it might surprise some
[15:05] people in the audience that the for the
[15:07] first sports conference I was able to
[15:09] attend was last year um in person and um
[15:13] it was sort of um you know hard to find
[15:16] content and um opportunities to network
[15:20] with industry folks like Greg was saying
[15:22] and so I uh I strongly encourage you to
[15:25] take advantage of those today uh
[15:27] unfortunately I'll be leaving right
[15:29] after this because I have to go back to
[15:31] Mexico City for a wedding but uh here's
[15:33] uh my website and my Twitter you should
[15:36] uh please contact me after the
[15:37] conference my email is in there as well
[15:39] I'd love to talk to you about uh
[15:41] anything Sports analytics related um the
[15:43] other thing that will be on my website
[15:44] will be the slides that I'll be sharing
[15:46] today so hopefully you can uh focus on
[15:48] the content more than the note taking um
[15:52] and with that we'll get started um I'll
[15:54] skip over a little bit of me because
[15:55] Greg already did this uh but so of um I
[16:00] studied math in Mexico City and was
[16:02] lucky enough to get a couple of
[16:03] scholarships to come over to the US and
[16:04] do a data science masters at NYU before
[16:08] um joining the Dodgers where uh I was
[16:11] very very lucky to win a World Series in
[16:13] the couple of years that I was there uh
[16:15] which I do not take for granted you know
[16:17] there's people that spent 30 years in
[16:19] the industry and don't get to do that
[16:21] and it was very very fun uh and after
[16:23] that I joined the team at sales
[16:25] analytics and I'll tell you about that
[16:27] in in just a second um so the cool part
[16:30] about winning a World Series is you get
[16:32] a World Series ring which is now sort of
[16:34] like a token I get to take everywhere
[16:37] and sort of bring out of storage
[16:39] whenever I'm having a bad day and I need
[16:40] some motivation um so another another
[16:44] cool aspect of sports analytics and a
[16:46] potential motivation to join the
[16:48] industry um I want to spend a couple of
[16:51] minutes talking to you about cellos
[16:53] analytics um so cellos is this company
[16:57] of amazing people that
[16:59] uh used to work in Academia or in sports
[17:02] teams and um have started sort of
[17:05] supporting teams around the globe uh we
[17:08] work with teams in all of these leagues
[17:12] uh in particular I work with MLB but we
[17:13] work with teams in the NFL the NBA
[17:17] soccer in Europe um hockey Cricket Golf
[17:20] and recently Esports um so we'd be very
[17:24] excited if you would consider sort of us
[17:26] as a good landing spot for your future
[17:28] sport analytics career and I'll tell you
[17:30] a little bit about sales baseball so we
[17:32] work with up to one team per division in
[17:35] MLB so if you've heard from us you've
[17:36] probably heard that uh but we also do a
[17:39] lot more stuff we're starting to expand
[17:41] internationally to work with teams
[17:42] outside of MLB and uh my focus recently
[17:46] has been on college baseball and sort of
[17:48] getting that space going so um if you
[17:51] work in with a college team and trying
[17:53] to Crunch winds out of data I'd love to
[17:55] talk to you uh we're starting a data
[17:58] engineering as a service product which
[18:01] um sort of helps you not have to worry
[18:04] about all the cleaning and stuff and
[18:05] just focus on the model building I think
[18:07] that's going to be very useful and
[18:09] lastly like if you're not a team but
[18:10] you're interested in evaluating players
[18:13] we'd love to talk to you uh we have
[18:14] products for you okay those concludes
[18:17] the advertising uh so uh I want to leave
[18:22] everyone in the room today with a little
[18:23] more idea of how baseball analytics got
[18:26] started sort of where we are now now and
[18:29] what open problems we have that may be
[18:31] of interest to attack in the future um
[18:35] in a way baseball analytics is sort of
[18:36] like a sports analytics history as well
[18:40] because it's probably the most mature
[18:42] sport certainly the one with the most
[18:44] work and most people in the industry
[18:45] involved um so we defined baseball
[18:48] analytics as datadriven tools to improve
[18:51] decision making and gain a Competitive
[18:53] Edge um I think the last part of that
[18:55] sentence was sort of not really known at
[18:59] the beginning of sports analytics but
[19:00] has certainly been proven with u the
[19:02] success of teams that have adapted this
[19:05] and you could really generalize this to
[19:07] a sports analytics 101 if not a baseball
[19:09] analytics 101 um so some of these tools
[19:12] are used in roster construction so this
[19:16] is probably the most mature area right
[19:19] like
[19:20] um I'm trying to compare between players
[19:24] to think about whether it makes sense to
[19:27] acquire a player or to ass sign them to
[19:29] a long-term contract extension um I want
[19:32] to be able to optimize the resources I
[19:34] have to make my roster better and I want
[19:36] to think about if I have this player in
[19:38] the minor leagues like should I bring
[19:39] them up to ml now can they help my team
[19:43] as
[19:44] is um we also do a lot of work in
[19:46] in-game strategy um I put two examples
[19:49] here but there's many more in particular
[19:52] like how do we want to approach this
[19:54] game from a pitching perspective and
[19:55] Bullpen usage is one that is very much
[19:58] the dat driven and fully adopted in the
[20:00] leak and the other is where should my
[20:03] Defenders go for this particular batter
[20:05] piture match up which is really
[20:06] interesting sort of problem of how does
[20:09] the spray of battered balls change for
[20:12] this um batter and their Tendencies and
[20:15] for this pitcher and their pitch
[20:20] selection um Player Development is a
[20:24] area that is sort of quickly developing
[20:26] but still a little behind the other two
[20:28] so
[20:29] um with
[20:32] the um growth in availability of
[20:34] kinematic data we are going to sort of
[20:37] start to open a whole new frontier here
[20:39] and I'll talk to you about that in a
[20:40] little second uh but in general I think
[20:43] in baseball and particular Improvement
[20:45] plans that are data driven are sort of
[20:48] very much an industry standard now
[20:50] whereas they weren't 10 years ago right
[20:52] so what is it in your game that you can
[20:55] improve to make you a better player and
[20:58] what sort of kpi should you be tracking
[21:00] as you're uh going through those
[21:02] Improvement
[21:03] plans and lastly a huge question that um
[21:06] GMS and president of baseball operations
[21:08] deal with all the time is like how good
[21:10] is my team right now should I spend
[21:13] future resources trying to make this
[21:15] team better now and go for a
[21:16] championship or should I be forgoing
[21:19] contending right now to try to build a
[21:21] better team for the
[21:22] future um so we do this in I'd like to
[21:26] divide it in a three-step process um it
[21:29] doesn't quite fit here there's there's
[21:32] sort of like a little fourth step in
[21:33] here but I I I'll tell you in a second
[21:35] why I chose three so uh the first is um
[21:39] sort of like in other areas of
[21:40] Statistics we want to be descriptive so
[21:43] we're trying to assign probabilities to
[21:47] past events in the best way that we can
[21:49] and sort of find patterns in those best
[21:52] events and we want statistics that are
[21:54] able to sort of summarize what happened
[21:57] in the past and I think the most
[21:59] relevant question for people in the room
[22:01] in this regard is like what should we
[22:03] meing um when you're thinking about um
[22:07] breaking into sports analytics you
[22:08] realize like a lot of the early research
[22:10] in baseball is like okay the game is
[22:13] happening like where should we spend our
[22:16] attention like what kind of data
[22:18] pipelines do we want to
[22:19] build uh so as you're moving to
[22:21] newssports that's sort of the first
[22:23] question and where you always want to
[22:25] start once you can describe things you
[22:28] want to predict them now so we go from
[22:31] assigning probabilities to past events
[22:32] to future events and trying to predict
[22:34] them and uh it's sort of like a two-step
[22:37] process here the first is called
[22:39] typically value attribution so the idea
[22:41] is I take these probabilities I see what
[22:43] actually happened and I try to explain
[22:46] the residuals like what part of this was
[22:48] just an actual residual and what part of
[22:50] this was a skill from the player that's
[22:52] sort of like involved in the action
[22:55] right either um we can actually
[22:57] attribute this to the P to the player or
[22:59] we have to go back to our descriptive
[23:01] model and improve it to make the
[23:02] probabilities more
[23:03] precise um and then we take those value
[23:07] attributions where we say hey this
[23:08] player was better than expectation in
[23:10] this situation and then we try to
[23:12] project into the future and that
[23:13] includes a whole sort of platora of
[23:16] interesting problems in particular aging
[23:18] curbs is one that's like you know still
[23:20] very much an open problem like I have
[23:23] this player they have this skills
[23:25] they're this age how do I expect them to
[23:28] look in three to five years which is a
[23:30] very very relevant question for the
[23:33] industry and then um I've sort of given
[23:36] this an entire new category uh this is
[23:38] my product hat speaking but really A lot
[23:41] of the like meet of the problem is in
[23:43] the predictive step but I really care
[23:45] about the prescriptive step which is um
[23:48] now you have this data like how do you
[23:50] build a decision making under
[23:55] uncertainty sort of culture that takes
[23:58] all of these projections and tells you
[24:00] like how should I build a team where
[24:02] should I spend my attention uh so the
[24:04] idea from perspective analytics is it
[24:06] creates actionable insights by
[24:09] recontextualizing models so a lot of
[24:10] player evaluation is sort of Team
[24:13] agnostic and at the prescriptive State
[24:15] you want to sort of take that back and
[24:18] um bring it back to your own team
[24:20] context right like if you already have
[24:22] three point guards adding another point
[24:24] guard is probably not going to be as
[24:26] beneficial as other teams and so um this
[24:30] is sort of like an Overlook step that I
[24:32] love working in um so a baseball example
[24:36] would be on the descriptive State like I
[24:39] have a pitch trajectory it crosses the
[24:41] plate in this location like what's the
[24:43] probability that that is a strike um
[24:46] after that there's this thing called
[24:47] catcher framing where the catcher
[24:49] receives it in such a way that they make
[24:51] it seem like the pitch cross the pitch
[24:53] Zone closer to the center and they try
[24:55] to fool the Umpire so we go from this
[24:58] probability to actually seeing the
[24:59] result of the pitch and seeing can we
[25:01] assign value to the scater in saying
[25:03] that they're good pitch framers and then
[25:06] we take this pitch framing skill right
[25:08] he's like a plus 10 or whatever and then
[25:11] we try to project how will this look
[25:13] next year five years from now 10 years
[25:14] from now and should we like acquire this
[25:17] player or pay them more money or trade
[25:19] them for a different player that's sort
[25:21] of like the five minute version of um
[25:25] what we do in baseball analytics and the
[25:28] sort of problems that I'm interested in
[25:30] and we'll dive a little bit more uh but
[25:32] first I want to dial you a little bit
[25:34] back to how we got
[25:37] here and I won't go all the way back
[25:40] we'll go back to the 1970s with Bill
[25:42] James so Bill James is this like
[25:47] um decisive figure in baseball analytics
[25:50] and that he starts publishing in 1977
[25:52] this sort of like magazine called the
[25:55] baseball abstract where he's starting to
[25:57] look at a lot problems in a new way and
[26:00] in the first five years he sort of like
[26:02] defines all of these Concepts that are
[26:04] still very very relevant today and that
[26:06] are still in our language and problems
[26:08] of Interest like aging curves TR already
[26:11] told you about uh runs created which
[26:13] we'll talk about in a second uh sort of
[26:15] like which Defender is uh which defense
[26:20] position is harder to play like how does
[26:23] the stadium affect what people do so all
[26:26] of these things that like we're still
[26:28] much trying to study and improved are
[26:30] kind of defined by Bill James in these
[26:32] first five years of the baseball
[26:33] abstract um another thing that James
[26:36] sort of starts to think about is we have
[26:39] the major leagues and the minor leagues
[26:40] like how do we take minor league
[26:42] performance and translate that to the
[26:44] major leagues which is very much still
[26:46] an open question and then lastly um he
[26:50] takes all these runs created and thinks
[26:53] how how does that like translate to wins
[26:55] for team which is sort of like what we
[26:58] use in the public sphere to evaluate
[27:00] baseball players right
[27:03] now um after uh James or or around the
[27:07] same time comes Pete Palmer uh he
[27:10] contributes sort of like the first um
[27:14] iteration of what we now called ops
[27:16] which is this idea of like let's get
[27:18] away from batting average think about
[27:20] you know what kind of damage are
[27:35] technical problems one
[27:37] second looks like someone has their mic
[27:40] on
[27:42] okay um and in 1984 Palmer publishes
[27:45] this book called the hidden game of
[27:47] baseball
[27:49] um and uh he presents this concept
[27:52] called linear weights which I want to
[27:54] talk to you about um and he also sort of
[27:57] builds like a PR for war um okay so
[28:01] here's an expected runs Matrix this is
[28:03] about as numbery as it will get so bear
[28:05] with me for the next 3 to four minutes
[28:08] so the idea is um the baseball space can
[28:11] be discretized in 24 different spaces so
[28:14] we have eight configurations for the
[28:16] bases we either have no Runners a runner
[28:19] on first a runner on second and so on
[28:21] and we have uh one of three possible out
[28:25] combinations either no outs one out or
[28:27] two outs once you reach three outs the
[28:29] inning is over and the next batting team
[28:31] comes to batt and so uh the numbers
[28:34] you're seeing here are what is the
[28:36] number of runs that this team is
[28:38] expected to score from this base state
[28:40] in the reminder of the inning so this is
[28:43] like a very simple statistic it's simply
[28:45] averaging out situations where I
[28:48] observed this base out State and I count
[28:51] how many runs are scored to the end of
[28:52] the inning and then I average that out
[28:55] uh linear weights are still um very much
[28:58] used to this day and are sort of built
[28:59] in this like very very simple idea so
[29:02] that's the kind of thing I mean where
[29:03] like what kind of thing should we
[29:05] measure is like a really really relevant
[29:07] question early on in sports
[29:09] analytics so okay so I take this
[29:12] expected run Matrix and now I'm trying
[29:14] to determine like I know how valuable a
[29:16] base out state is and now I want to
[29:19] determine like how valuable is an action
[29:21] in the field so uh I'll use a single as
[29:24] an example so a single is when the
[29:27] batter reaches first base safely um so
[29:30] here's one situation where there's no
[29:32] Runners on out the battery hits a single
[29:33] and reaches first base like can I assign
[29:36] a run value to that and the answer is
[29:39] yes it's this so how do we get there I I
[29:44] I'm going to bring back the um run
[29:46] expectation Matrix and you'll see that
[29:48] like we have three possible scenarios in
[29:51] which this occurred either with zero
[29:52] outs one out or two outs and we know how
[29:55] valuable each of these transitions is
[29:57] because we can simply substract the
[29:59] start state to the end state so we're in
[30:01] full Marian space here and if I simply
[30:05] do a weighted average by how often this
[30:07] happens in each out situation I'm now
[30:10] back to being able to determine like how
[30:12] valuable is going from no Runners to a
[30:15] runner on first uh this is a luxury that
[30:18] baseball is afforded and other sports
[30:21] are very much not so uh the fact that
[30:25] you can just like take this game State
[30:27] Advent into the next game State and say
[30:29] how valuable is this transition is very
[30:32] much an open question in basketball in
[30:35] soccer like the methods to get there are
[30:37] way more complicated and all real
[30:39] advances to this problem have been made
[30:41] in the last you know 20 to 10 years
[30:44] where we start with discretizing the
[30:46] space and try to bring it back to a
[30:47] continuous more interesting space um so
[30:50] if anyone is interested sort of in other
[30:52] sports EPB is where you want to start
[30:54] for that uh the expected possession
[30:56] value okay so now I'm able to quantify
[30:59] the Run value of the situation I do that
[31:01] for all possible combinations of a
[31:03] single so sometimes they happen with a
[31:05] runner on first uh sometimes they happen
[31:07] with a runner on first that then goes to
[31:09] Third Base sometimes they happen with a
[31:11] runner on second that then scores and
[31:14] then uh I keep going with all situations
[31:17] I count like how many times does this
[31:20] happen in a season and then I assign
[31:22] weights to this problem so it just
[31:24] becomes a weighted average and now I'm
[31:26] able to say like the Run value of a
[31:28] single is this number and so linear
[31:32] weights concerns Itself by giving run
[31:35] values to actions in the field and we do
[31:38] this base out State neutral right
[31:40] because the batter doesn't really have
[31:42] control on what's going on in the basis
[31:44] before he starts to perform that's
[31:46] another sort of like luxury for baseball
[31:49] is all of these actions are separate one
[31:51] from another and in that way we're able
[31:54] to um sort of like assign value to a
[31:57] single actor whereas if this happened in
[31:59] soccer you would need to assign some
[32:01] kind of spacing value to a player moving
[32:03] and generating a passing Lane for
[32:07] example okay thank you for bearing with
[32:09] me that's about as number as we'll get
[32:11] um I want to talk to you about Keith
[32:13] wner so Keith was a uh central figure in
[32:17] baseball analytics he sort of created
[32:20] something called Vol over replacement
[32:22] player which is again another precursor
[32:24] of War which is how we measure player
[32:26] value in the public sphere he then joins
[32:29] baseball prospectus as the director of
[32:31] research and development and he
[32:33] publishes this article in 2000 that will
[32:35] discuss a little today uh called
[32:38] baseball's hilpert
[32:41] problems so if you're familiar hilpert
[32:43] goes uh in um 1900 in front of um a con
[32:49] uh a conference of mathematicians that
[32:51] sort of presents what he thinks the most
[32:54] relevant open problems are for
[32:56] mathematics for the next century and
[32:58] it's probably like the most famous
[33:00] mathematical speech that exists because
[33:01] those problems are still very relevant
[33:04] and some of them are still open um and
[33:06] so I kind of want to go through some of
[33:09] Keith woolner's open problems in 2000 to
[33:12] tell you like where are we as an
[33:14] industry what have we solved and what
[33:15] kind of interesting problems will come I
[33:18] won't say in The Next Century but in the
[33:19] next decade or so
[33:22] um so um e has these sort of criteria to
[33:27] include these problems in his um Hilbert
[33:30] list uh I want to list them very quickly
[33:33] uh to be relevant right Sports analytics
[33:35] has to inform a decision and um this is
[33:39] very relevant for folks in the room
[33:40] because I think the biggest difference
[33:42] between public and private research in
[33:45] sports is at a team you're not really
[33:48] concerned with anything that can't
[33:50] improve decision making and so the
[33:53] easiest way to match the private sphere
[33:56] in research is to think like what kind
[33:59] of decision making does a coach or a
[34:02] Player Development um analyst or like a
[34:06] GM have to make and think of possible
[34:09] like research opportunities in that area
[34:12] um so as you're starting to get um going
[34:14] with research and sports analytics this
[34:16] is something I would strongly encourage
[34:17] you to
[34:19] do um it most consider the context of
[34:22] the game right we don't play baseball in
[34:24] a vacuum we play baseball in the major
[34:27] leagues and within this sort of like
[34:29] company and money-making structure um a
[34:33] good problem is a good problem
[34:34] irregardless of whether you have
[34:36] resources to answer that problem right
[34:38] now so that's something we'll talk about
[34:39] in a second but Keith sort of like
[34:42] builds these questions thinking like
[34:44] gosh there's I'd really like to answer
[34:46] this but I don't have the data for it
[34:47] right now um and very similarly like
[34:51] reasoning is valid whether we can
[34:53] measure or quantify something or not uh
[34:56] right like a good hypothesis to test out
[34:58] in the future is very much a worthwhile
[35:03] Endeavor okay so Keith builts these 23
[35:06] problems that he thinks are like
[35:08] Paramount for baseball analytics in the
[35:10] next uh few decades the first one is
[35:13] separating defense into pitching and
[35:14] fielding and it's funny because the quot
[35:17] he presents is like gosh these two are
[35:19] so together that it seems like
[35:20] impossible to separate them uh and as
[35:23] we'll see in a second we're sort of like
[35:26] at the point where we've to separate
[35:28] these two things um and another one is
[35:32] he really wants to take sort of minor
[35:35] leak pitchers and think like how will
[35:37] this player perform in the major leagues
[35:39] and pitching is really intertwined with
[35:42] the difficulty of bouting phase so any
[35:44] sort of like batter related statistic
[35:46] that you take has this problem of like
[35:48] once you change the difficulty of um
[35:52] competition phase like how will that
[35:54] translate so these two are very much
[35:56] intertwined and they're solved by this
[35:59] new technology that comes along in 2006
[36:01] called pitch effects so pitch effects is
[36:04] the two camera system that takes 20
[36:07] images as the pitch is traveling from
[36:09] the mount to the plate uh it determines
[36:12] like the 3D location of the pitch in
[36:14] those 20 images and then it fits the
[36:16] best trajectory it can to those points
[36:19] to give a speed break and location for
[36:23] this particular Peach uh and then
[36:25] simultaneously manually there's someone
[36:28] in the booth sort of like uh writing
[36:31] down like what was the result of this
[36:32] pitch and the result of this at that and
[36:35] getting this data was revolutionary for
[36:37] pitching and Fielding analysis so
[36:41] um the sort of like the most relevant
[36:44] portion of this is we start developing
[36:46] defense independent pitching
[36:50] statistics the very first one is
[36:52] developed by Boris McCracken in 2001 um
[36:56] and it's sort of like before this
[36:58] technology comes along right and so uh
[37:00] Boris is interested in the same problem
[37:02] and what he realizes is there's a lot of
[37:05] Statistics that only concern the pitcher
[37:07] and not the defense because the ball
[37:09] isn't really in play so strikeouts walks
[37:12] home runs hit by pitches are something
[37:15] that the pitcher controls but that don't
[37:17] involve the defense and so he creates
[37:19] this statistic that like is now fully
[37:22] under the pitcher controlled uh this is
[37:24] sort of like a precursor for FIP which
[37:27] is is still very much used today to talk
[37:29] about pictures everywhere in the
[37:31] industry uh and other Baran that are
[37:33] still around
[37:35] so you can take that idea and bring it
[37:38] one step forward uh and the best sort of
[37:40] like public research on this is called
[37:42] Stuff Plus and the idea of Stuff Plus is
[37:46] based on a pitch movement alone like how
[37:50] good is this pitch um so we take the
[37:54] pitch's velocity the pitch type the
[37:57] horizontal and the vertical break and
[38:00] with this um kind of like nearest
[38:03] neighbors like technique uh of course
[38:06] everyone solves it a little differently
[38:07] and I won't tell you how we solve that
[38:09] at cellus but with this sort of like
[38:11] nearest neighbors Technique we can say
[38:13] like gosh this pitch that breaks a lot
[38:16] is really good because it generates a
[38:18] lot of swing and miss and now we're at a
[38:21] state where uh we've taken this defense
[38:23] independent pitching and put it in like
[38:25] a whole different sphere right we're
[38:27] able to do it for every single outcome
[38:30] independent of the defense and sort of
[38:33] like the location of the pitch so now we
[38:34] know like how good is this pitcher
[38:37] repertoire alog together um stuff is
[38:40] sort of like a game changer because
[38:43] pitch trajectories are sort of also
[38:45] independent of the quality of batting
[38:48] that you're facing Mo for the most part
[38:50] and in that way we're able to much more
[38:53] accurately just take a picture from the
[38:55] minor leaks and project them to to um
[38:58] how good they're going to be in the
[38:59] major
[39:02] leagues uh another sort of question that
[39:05] Keith poses is about the league
[39:08] environment so uh just think about like
[39:12] how can small Market teams compete when
[39:14] Big Market teams have like eight times
[39:17] the budget and aren't really able to
[39:19] keep their players um and as you know
[39:23] the answer is sort of like Brewing ask
[39:25] key disposing this question right Money
[39:27] Ball comes out in 2003 and it's about
[39:30] the 2001 and 2002 a and so uh we're
[39:35] really like as an industry already
[39:37] working on this as this question is
[39:40] being posed and uh since then there
[39:42] haven't been any like back-to-back
[39:44] champions in MLB uh in that period the
[39:46] Red Sox have won the most championships
[39:48] with four so under sort of like 20% of
[39:51] the championship so there really is like
[39:53] a perennial mixture of contending teams
[39:57] and small Market teams are able to be in
[39:59] the playoffs and compete every single
[40:01] year um sort of like the race are the
[40:03] best example of this of taking like a
[40:05] lot of data driven decision making to um
[40:09] a full extreme and seeing like God how
[40:12] can we compete with like a bottom five
[40:13] payroll all the time and they found an
[40:16] answer and they able to do it so um this
[40:19] league environment is also something
[40:20] that um we've made a lot of advancements
[40:24] in um W Le really have an idea of like
[40:28] you know how good are patchers like how
[40:31] do they help like is it preventing
[40:33] Runners is it on game calling is it on
[40:36] like keeping an eye on a pitcher's
[40:39] fatigue uh and once we're able to get
[40:42] pitch tracking we now are able to build
[40:45] sort of like foundational models for
[40:48] strike probability for um throwing out a
[40:52] runner given um like the speed of the
[40:55] pitch its location and
[40:57] uh how good this Runner is and like will
[41:00] this pitch go backwards and let the
[41:03] runners advance and now we know that the
[41:04] most important of those three things is
[41:06] framing by like a very significant
[41:09] margin and so we're able to produce sort
[41:12] of like these value attributions On The
[41:14] Run scale for catchers on Framing and um
[41:18] funnily enough like when you go back uh
[41:20] there's this like very famous example in
[41:22] the community of Ryan dumit who was sort
[41:25] of like a good catch for uh the major
[41:28] leagues he plays for he played for like
[41:30] a decade and when we started including
[41:33] framing in our evaluation we realized
[41:35] like you know what dumit wasn't that
[41:37] good a player like his whole career was
[41:39] reevaluated and realiz we realized that
[41:41] like he was below replacement for seven
[41:44] of his 10 major league seasons and
[41:46] really wouldn't play with that skill set
[41:49] in MLB
[41:51] today
[41:54] um wner postes two interesting questions
[41:57] in market value like how valuable is
[42:00] positional flexibility right like if I
[42:02] have someone that can play all infield
[42:04] positions or all three Corner Outfield
[42:06] positions like how valuable is that um
[42:10] and uh duck fearing and a collaborator
[42:12] looked at this and sort of said you know
[42:14] flexibility can gain you up to two wins
[42:17] in a season uh that paper is um some one
[42:21] I would recommend and um wner is also
[42:25] not sure like how can we create a
[42:26] framework to evaluate trades and we've
[42:29] sort of like answered this in in
[42:31] different ways between public and
[42:33] industry but there's this website called
[42:35] uh baseball trade values that sort of
[42:37] does that it's it takes projections it
[42:39] takes how controllable this player's
[42:42] contract is and their cost it assigns
[42:44] them a monetary value it's also able to
[42:47] assign monetary value to something like
[42:49] draft picks and then it tells you like
[42:52] how much money is changing in this trade
[42:54] and who's sort of like getting the best
[42:56] of it
[42:59] so uh hopefully i' I've made the case
[43:02] that we've come a long way in 20 years
[43:04] uh and I kind of want to move on to like
[43:08] what do I think are some really
[43:10] interesting questions in the next few
[43:12] years for the industry before we open it
[43:14] up to questions in the room um this is a
[43:17] very fancy title but it should really
[43:19] say like here are my hot takes on the
[43:21] future of baseball so bear with me as we
[43:24] start to walk through this one um and
[43:27] this is really driven by another change
[43:30] in technology right so MLB started
[43:32] partnering with Hawkeye Technologies
[43:34] starting in the 2020 season so in
[43:37] compared to the two camera system we had
[43:39] in 2006 we now have a 12 camera system
[43:42] in every single Major League Stadium and
[43:45] a lot of minor league stadiums and um we
[43:48] have just so much more data so in 2020
[43:52] uh these cameras were capturing a
[43:55] skeletal model
[43:57] of um every single player in the field
[44:01] that tells us like where are their
[44:03] elbows where's their left hip as their
[44:05] wrist is starting to pronate at 100
[44:08] frames a second uh we're now up to 300
[44:12] frames per second and 29 points per each
[44:15] of these players so the availability of
[44:17] data we have is sort of growing like
[44:20] crazy um here's some graphs that I um
[44:23] borrowed from Nick Juan so in the Box
[44:26] Car era we should have had 10 megabytes
[44:28] per season Once you get to play byplay
[44:30] and you start adding results of that you
[44:32] get to 500 megabytes per season once you
[44:36] start adding tracking data you very
[44:37] quickly get to 4 and a half terabytes
[44:40] per season and then um sorry yeah to to
[44:45] five terabytes per season and once you
[44:47] start adding player tracking you get to
[44:49] 30 30 terabytes of of data per season
[44:53] and this was sort of like at the
[44:54] beginning in 2020 but uh you'll notice
[44:56] there's a missing statistic here it's
[44:59] probably closer to 100 to 200 terabytes
[45:04] of data at this point with the new
[45:05] skeletal model and all the tracking data
[45:07] we have so just being able to um go into
[45:12] this data will give us so many more
[45:14] problems to work on um so here's sort of
[45:18] like how that looks on the MLB side
[45:19] they're able to have these skeletal
[45:21] poses for everyone in the field at at
[45:23] all moments and animate them uh we also
[45:26] now are able to track the bat which is
[45:29] really really exciting uh and that's
[45:32] sort of problem number one for me is
[45:36] like what is a good swing like we just
[45:39] kind of don't know
[45:43] um changing pitch quality competition
[45:47] from the minor to the major leagues
[45:48] makes hitting translations a lot more
[45:51] difficult right so if you're facing 94
[45:54] miles an hour in the minor leaks and you
[45:55] come up and you're facing 90 9 mil hour
[45:58] your muscle memory is just completely
[46:00] thrown off and
[46:03] so because hitting is reactive instead
[46:06] of pitching which is simply about um
[46:09] sort of like throwing the trajectory
[46:11] without worrying too much about who's in
[46:13] the plate um it's much more harder to
[46:17] say like how good is this hitter if we
[46:20] haven't seen him in the major leagues
[46:22] and
[46:24] um the other thing that happens at the
[46:26] major league level level
[46:28] is if you have a hole in your game um
[46:32] teams now have sort of like Advanced
[46:35] scouting teams that are looking at the
[46:37] next opponent and seeing that hole in
[46:39] your game and that is going to get
[46:40] exploited really really fast so I can
[46:43] remember a particular baseball Prospect
[46:45] who could not hit a high fastball he was
[46:47] a highly touted Prospect and um when he
[46:50] reached the major leaks like teams just
[46:52] started throwing High fast balls to him
[46:54] and he could never adjust and is sort of
[46:56] like
[46:57] out of the league now um there's this
[47:01] other like really interesting thing
[47:03] about baseball
[47:05] like we have so many different types of
[47:08] athletes and body types and it's not
[47:11] like football where you have offensive
[47:13] linemen and wide receivers but each of
[47:15] those have a different function like all
[47:17] batters are sort of trying to solve the
[47:18] same problem in in different ways but
[47:20] the same problem right so the mechanics
[47:22] of someone that's 68 versus someone
[47:24] that's 56 are very different and the way
[47:27] that they're able to generate strength
[47:29] or value are very different so like how
[47:33] can we abstract this player's context
[47:36] and think about what is a good swing is
[47:40] very very much an open question and
[47:42] something I'm really interested in um
[47:44] another difference between batters there
[47:46] some of them guess right it's a 20 count
[47:50] uh this person has shown me this ler
[47:52] twice they haven't been able to locate
[47:53] it so I think there's a fast ball cing
[47:56] I'm going to sit fast fastball I'm going
[47:57] to swing at this pitch sort of like
[47:58] irregardless of what's happening and try
[48:00] to guess other hitters just try to pick
[48:03] up the trajectory and react and so like
[48:06] how good are these two approaches we
[48:09] don't really know because we can't
[48:11] really measure those but with
[48:13] backtracking data and timing data I
[48:16] think we'll be able to more um cleanly
[48:19] separate like who's guessing and who's
[48:21] reacting and how good are these
[48:23] strategies in this game context
[48:29] um physical movement Varan is not
[48:31] something that we've been able to look
[48:33] at or
[48:35] quantify uh so like you know how
[48:38] repeatable is your physical motion and
[48:40] your swing and how much are you changing
[48:43] from a dayto day or a week to week
[48:45] perspective is that leading to injury uh
[48:48] is that sort of like exploitable and in
[48:51] particular like I think this might have
[48:54] a relationship to clutch hitting so the
[48:56] Sports analytics take on clutch hitting
[48:58] is like we just don't have enough sample
[49:00] size to determine whether this exists
[49:02] but of course when you talk to coaches
[49:03] like of course it exists right and I
[49:06] think there's something to it here I
[49:08] think there's something about people
[49:10] that have longer swings that are able to
[49:13] get exploited when the moment gets too
[49:15] quick and their heart is like really
[49:17] really going because they can't really
[49:18] rely on muscle memory all that
[49:21] much um hopefully I'm I'm starting to
[49:24] get you excited about the kinds of
[49:25] things that we're um building so number
[49:28] two is reimagining pitcher roles so if
[49:31] you know something about baseball
[49:32] there's sort of like a starter who
[49:35] pitches at the beginning of the game and
[49:36] tries to take this um as long as
[49:39] possible and then there's relievers that
[49:40] usually pitch for one inning and come in
[49:43] particular situations uh this was a
[49:45] question that wner was interested in in
[49:47] 2000 and we've sort of like changed a
[49:49] lot uh we now have things called openers
[49:52] that's sort of like a reliever going
[49:53] ahead of the starter against the one to
[49:57] four hitters who are sort of like the
[49:59] best hitters in the lineup to try to
[50:01] extend the time for which the starter is
[50:03] able to play um this might seem like the
[50:06] most obvious thing in the world but
[50:07] starters pitch way more than relievers
[50:10] and in that way they're able to
[50:11] accumulate so much more value uh it's
[50:14] not quite the whole difference in
[50:16] playing time because relievers come in
[50:18] in higher leverage situations and in
[50:21] that way uh are very valuable but sort
[50:24] of like my rule of thumb is like the med
[50:26] in fifth starter is about as valuable as
[50:29] the best third is reliever in the league
[50:33] and so if you have a good pitcher who's
[50:35] sort of like third or fourth in Your
[50:38] Bullpen I think you should convert them
[50:40] to a starter and um there was sort of uh
[50:44] this question in the industry of like
[50:45] can we make a pitcher that throws one
[50:47] inning per game Throw six Innings
[50:50] without giving them sort of like an
[50:52] offseason training and in the last few
[50:54] years we've seen at least these six
[50:56] examples of people that have
[50:57] transitioned from one to the other
[50:58] successfully and are now able to start
[51:01] um I kind of want to like take this one
[51:05] one step further so in 93 Tony larusa
[51:07] tried to do this thing where he took his
[51:10] pitching divided it into three groups
[51:12] and wanted everyone to throw um every
[51:15] third day for three Innings I kind of
[51:17] want to get to a world where we're not
[51:20] thinking about starters and relievers
[51:21] we're just thinking about pitchers and
[51:23] how to maximize their value so I think
[51:25] this is very much an open question and
[51:26] one I'm very interested in um I'm going
[51:28] to try to hurry because I'm running out
[51:30] of time so number three is uh I think
[51:32] the stuff problem is really solved but
[51:35] then the residual between like what we
[51:37] see and stuff is really hard to explain
[51:41] at the moment um so we think some of
[51:45] this is due to where the pitch crosses
[51:47] the plate and how good the pitcher is at
[51:49] commanding that note that I've put these
[51:52] two together they're hard to separate
[51:54] because we don't really know where the
[51:56] pitch will the picture was intending to
[51:58] throw we can have a proxy with where the
[52:00] catcher stood but not quite the intended
[52:02] location so like where's the pitcher
[52:05] trying to throw it and where do they put
[52:06] it that's one part of it uh their pitch
[52:09] selection and sequencing certainly place
[52:11] a part here and like how many pitch
[52:14] types they have is very relevant because
[52:16] the batter is trying to guess like
[52:18] what's coming and if he's guessing
[52:20] between two pitches and four pitches
[52:22] it's a lot harder to guess and they have
[52:24] to react more um so there's this like um
[52:28] predictability versus best pitch sort of
[52:32] um Continuum my take is people don't
[52:35] throw their best pitch enough but we
[52:37] don't know right we we kind of we know
[52:40] that like you shouldn't throw your best
[52:41] pitch 100% of the time because then
[52:43] people will guess but we don't know
[52:44] where the ideal is um and then there's
[52:47] this like deception piece where some
[52:49] pitchers are able to hide the ball with
[52:51] their body and uh Beyond results we can
[52:55] like um don't really quantify deception
[52:57] very well right
[52:59] now um two more to go so um how do we
[53:03] use data and Coach players is very much
[53:05] an open question baseball has made more
[53:07] progress than other sports in this area
[53:09] there are this tradeoffs between like
[53:11] taking risks to improve as an athlete
[53:13] and added injury risk that I think are
[53:16] uh given incentives very clear for
[53:18] players that are in The Fringe of a
[53:19] roster right if I can't improve I won't
[53:21] make a team therefore I'll take the
[53:24] added injury risk but for established
[53:26] major leaders and for Stars this is sort
[53:28] of like less clear like should you take
[53:31] this extra injury risk to become better
[53:33] or should you take your career like
[53:36] projected career trajectory as is um
[53:39] when to make a coaching intervention is
[53:41] one question I'm really interested in
[53:43] right like once you're in the major
[53:44] leagues you're already sort of like um
[53:47] an elite athlete like should a coach
[53:49] really intervene or should they just let
[53:51] you be because there's a risk that
[53:52] they'll make you worse uh I don't think
[53:54] we have a great answer for that uh
[53:56] short-term improvements versus long-term
[53:58] Health very much an open question um how
[54:01] prone are you to injury and how is that
[54:03] related to your workload uh we don't
[54:06] know there's some like rule of thumbs uh
[54:08] for when to use pictures and when to use
[54:11] batters and when to give them time up
[54:12] but um we we just don't really know
[54:17] um and um lastly the one I'm very very
[54:21] interested is like you have analytics
[54:24] tools now how do you do datadriven
[54:27] decision-making like how do you build a
[54:29] data culture and uh I think it relates
[54:31] to bringing back context to your
[54:34] decision making um more
[54:38] flexibly moving economic assumptions in
[54:41] your models to reflect your reality
[54:43] right now and um be able to better
[54:46] capture the impact to your particular
[54:49] roster um and um I want to thank you all
[54:52] this morning for coming I know it's
[54:54] early and on a Saturday uh so again
[54:56] here's my website and my Twitter where
[54:58] you can reach me I'll put the slides up
[55:00] there and um I'll I'll open up the floor
[55:03] for any
[55:11] questions um
[55:23] yep um so if I understand the question
[55:25] correctly the question is uh is my job
[55:28] more related to building
[55:36] formulas um okay so building the formula
[55:39] versus understanding the formula uh
[55:41] Sports is very particular in that
[55:45] there's going to be one person
[55:46] ultimately making these decisions and
[55:49] that person really wants to understand
[55:50] like where does this projection come
[55:52] from um so in the early stage in the
[55:55] predictive stage where we're just
[55:57] building models that predict the
[55:58] probability of something like um like a
[56:01] cult strike probability that is going to
[56:03] be much more formula performance driven
[56:07] right so you'll use a lot more black
[56:09] boxy machine learning techniques that
[56:11] are simply trying to say this is the
[56:14] most accurate model I can build but at
[56:16] the last stage of that at the
[56:18] prescriptive stage you're trying to
[56:20] build really interpretable models that
[56:23] someone with a non-technical background
[56:25] can look at and say
[56:26] okay I understand where this projection
[56:28] is coming from this player is good at
[56:30] decision making and power hitting but
[56:32] not really contact um so the answer is
[56:35] both it depends sort of like where in
[56:38] the Spectrum you
[56:40] are
[56:52] yes yeah so the question is um with
[56:55] things like The Yips what was the other
[56:59] one and slumps so uh slumps are sort of
[57:02] like performance Varan where a batter or
[57:05] a pitcher just has like a rough patch
[57:08] like how are you able to determine that
[57:10] with data um on the current state what
[57:13] you try to do is you try to see if
[57:15] there's a difference between expected
[57:17] results and actual results right is this
[57:20] just simply bad luck or has something
[57:23] underlying for this player changed in a
[57:25] way that now needs a coaching
[57:27] intervention um for pitchers we actually
[57:31] have like much better understanding of
[57:33] their kinematic chain and reports built
[57:35] out that say like no look this person is
[57:38] now bringing their toe down you know
[57:41] five frames before than last week we
[57:43] should try to get their movement in
[57:45] control for batters we do not and so uh
[57:48] I think there's still very much an open
[57:49] question on that end of like is this
[57:52] lump driven by someone changing their
[57:54] swing or is it just purely like about
[57:56] look this week um but I think we'll have
[57:58] a lot more tools to answer these
[58:00] questions in the next fiveish
[58:03] years um one more because I'm I can see
[58:05] the organizers and there goes yes
[58:24] Elliot yeah so the question is is um if
[58:27] you need interpretable models how do you
[58:29] use machine learning or AI in this
[58:31] scenario um early in the pipeline right
[58:34] like the decision maker is not going to
[58:36] be looking at is your blocking
[58:39] probability correct so in that way you
[58:41] want to use them as building blocks to
[58:44] get to a point where you're then able to
[58:46] build the interpretable model better um
[58:49] having said that there's a lot of like
[58:51] interesting machine learning techniques
[58:52] that are actually interpretable or that
[58:55] we have tools to inter interpret so
[58:56] something like Chaple graphs are used in
[58:58] the industry a lot um any sort of like
[59:02] basian actor attribution is very useful
[59:05] and that we're able to see like with and
[59:07] without this actor how do the
[59:09] predictions change and in that way
[59:10] understand this particular actor better
[59:12] so there are ways of doing it but it's
[59:14] still sort of like an active area of
[59:16] research um I'm sorry I have to run
[59:19] again if you have any more questions I
[59:21] know there were more in the room please
[59:23] send me an email my email is in that
[59:24] website and I'll also post a like there
[59:26] uh and it was lovely talking to you all
[59:28] this morning thank you for the
[59:29] invitation
