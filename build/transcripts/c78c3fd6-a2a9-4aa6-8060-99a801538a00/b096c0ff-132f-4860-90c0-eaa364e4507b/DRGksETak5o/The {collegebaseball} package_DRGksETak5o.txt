[00:00] and so I created a
[00:04] package that allows you to get college
[00:08] baseball and the easiest way to do it is
[00:11] running Dev tools installcore
[00:15] GitHub and then my name Robert D
[00:19] fry baseball or not baseball R um
[00:23] college baseball
[00:30] and I'll just say Force equals true so I
[00:32] can show you what that would look
[00:37] like so we're just I'm
[00:43] redownloading the
[00:45] data or installing the
[00:49] package for you so it should run
[00:51] shouldn't take too long if at all there
[00:53] you
[00:56] go and then
[01:01] what we can do with
[01:03] this is then call our library college
[01:08] baseball what we can do is get stats
[01:11] from there so but first the team ID is
[01:15] actually
[01:17] changed so all you have to do is look up
[01:19] a school
[01:21] ID so we'll say like
[01:25] Tennessee and then my argument compared
[01:29] to baseball R is it asks for a year
[01:31] because it changes every
[01:33] year so you see the team ID but then I
[01:37] have a column called the previous team
[01:38] ID just in case if they ever go back to
[01:41] that the code can arrange for
[01:44] that
[01:46] so gets all the same information so the
[01:49] SE season ID is the same division
[01:51] conference conference ID is same team
[01:53] name and then you have the team ID and
[01:56] then you have the previous team ID again
[01:58] and that's in the old code that gets the
[02:01] previous te ID because it has changed
[02:05] quite a bit
[02:08] so let
[02:11] me see if I can pull up this NCA stats
[02:16] page and bring it on to
[02:21] here
[02:23] so when you go to Tennessee's page
[02:32] no
[02:35] baseball go
[02:37] 2024 and now the ID essentially becomes
[02:42] this instead of what it was in the past
[02:45] which was you know
[02:48] 694 that doesn't mean it's going away
[02:51] because it does apply
[03:01] in other situations and I'm trying to
[03:03] think of one where it does apply but so
[03:06] the ID has just became a little bit
[03:08] different
[03:10] now
[03:17] um
[03:19] so U let's go to Team history so see
[03:25] when I click on
[03:27] this the old URL or I guess the old team
[03:31] ID appears but in the data set it's
[03:34] still available either way so that way
[03:37] if you know that those new IDs don't
[03:39] work you can still use this team
[03:43] ID so when we go back into
[03:47] R we can
[03:49] do I say 10 for
[03:52] short NCAA
[03:55] stats and the team
[03:57] ID now that we know Tennessee is is 754
[04:00] 226 we'll add that in there year
[04:05] 2024 we'll leave our type to equal
[04:09] batting now we run that takes a little
[04:12] bit
[04:14] longer but still pulls the
[04:17] data and now we have height we have bat
[04:22] throw for not every
[04:24] team um I'm sure the bigger schools will
[04:27] have a bat throw but now I have a team I
[04:29] ID a conference ID a player
[04:32] ID and again it sucks because it changes
[04:35] year by year so like Christian Moore in
[04:40] 2023 his player ID will look different
[04:43] than compared to
[04:45] 2024 and I can show you
[04:48] that
[04:52] so let's say Tenny dplr
[04:57] filter um
[05:01] player name equals Christian
[05:06] Moore then we'll just say
[05:09] dplr
[05:13] pull player
[05:16] a make sure that's the right column play
[05:25] yep so let me add and dly our the L
[05:32] liaries and it'll give you messages so
[05:34] on and so
[05:36] forth but it's not an
[05:40] error so then I run this and you can see
[05:44] his player ID in
[05:47] 2024 is 8281 1448 for Christian Moore
[05:52] but when you
[05:52] [Music]
[05:54] run Tennessee's data for 2023 so you
[05:57] have your team ID is 548
[06:03] 305 so see it changes every year now and
[06:07] we have to adjust for that
[06:10] so 5
[06:14] 48305 and the previous year is
[06:18] 2023 run
[06:22] it give it a second or two to
[06:26] run now we pull the same data but then
[06:29] when we look at Christian Moore so his
[06:31] 2024 team ID was again 8281
[06:36] 1448 but now his ID is 7831
[06:45] 1204 so that's something you have to be
[06:48] wary of and I'm thinking of
[06:50] ways I have code
[06:54] somewhere it's possible that I can
[06:57] probably either I might either e create
[07:00] my own player ID system or really dig
[07:03] through
[07:05] the uh NCA stats archives and find
[07:08] player IDs that actually
[07:14] match but that this is how you would get
[07:18] stats again download the college
[07:20] baseball
[07:24] package by running this code with taking
[07:28] out the comment so dead tools
[07:30] installcore
[07:32] GitHub my
[07:34] name college
[07:37] baseball and it gets you like you know
[07:39] some neat
[07:42] information so that's kind of like the
[07:45] basic stats you can get but you can get
[07:47] like available Savant games for college
[07:51] baseball
[07:52] so I'll just call this HH call whatever
[07:55] you
[07:56] want and so what this pulls from is from
[08:01] 2017 until this past
[08:06] season some games will have statas data
[08:09] available and so you can pull that
[08:11] statas
[08:14] data but however some games may
[08:17] not want to double check because some
[08:21] like I'm pretty sure the Salt River
[08:23] feels that Talking Stick don't Brazzle
[08:26] feel that GCU ballpark will not
[08:31] slone Park I don't believe has it
[08:38] either so I will make sure to double
[08:41] check that and
[08:44] re-upload for you guys but this allows
[08:47] you to create or get like statcast data
[08:50] so then you can say like oh what's uh
[08:54] what's a game from 2024
[08:56] that might have some interest I trying
[08:59] to think of the chase Burns
[09:04] game that had data it might have been
[09:07] Wake Forest Florida
[09:09] State or it might have been it might
[09:11] have been W Wake Forest North Carolina
[09:14] actually so I get that game
[09:17] PK and I can say like wake you know UNC
[09:22] we'll call
[09:24] it we'll use the college baseball
[09:27] package and we'll say stat cast beat PBP
[09:30] College then we'll run this six-digit
[09:32] code get the game
[09:35] PK give your a second two to
[09:45] run and then you
[09:47] have stack ass data for that
[09:51] game so you get sha spray you get Chase
[09:54] Burns's data from Wake Forest and again
[09:57] this is only for a limited amount of
[09:59] games it's not for every single
[10:01] team um some places will have stack ass
[10:05] data so like one advantage that we
[10:11] have is like okay you have the Las Vegas
[10:14] ballpark so like all the tripa a fields
[10:16] that teams may play at there's likely to
[10:18] be stat Gast dat now because every tripa
[10:20] a field has stat
[10:23] Gast so like one example is Las Vegas
[10:27] ballpark um Smith
[10:30] ballpark which is also the home ballpark
[10:33] of Utah so really we have mostly Utah
[10:36] data because that's their home field but
[10:39] then if you go to other places like
[10:40] Durham Bulls Athletic Park Triple A for
[10:43] Durham they'll have stack ass data um
[10:46] your
[10:48] typical um Global Life Field stack ass
[10:52] data trius field again tripa a field
[10:55] stack ass data uh bay care ballpark does
[10:59] have stack cast though it's not a AAA
[11:01] field it's I want to say it's either a
[11:04] high a or a rookie league field but it
[11:06] does have stat cast data when you play
[11:08] there and the American Athletic
[11:10] Conference Conference tournament was
[11:12] there so we got stat cast data for
[11:17] those um what are some other place like
[11:20] PNC West Virginia and Pittsburgh they
[11:22] played there so there there was Data
[11:25] there um Dodger Stadium though
[11:32] I think they took it
[11:36] down let's check so we'll check one of
[11:38] these
[11:39] games because realistically even though
[11:42] it may be played at a an MLB
[11:46] stadium oh looks like the data is still
[11:49] there cool
[12:01] so it gives you all the sack say but it
[12:06] gives you like different columns to what
[12:08] you may be used to with stat gas data
[12:11] because again like if you go through the
[12:13] columns on baseball
[12:16] Sant um exit you know exit velocity is
[12:20] listed as like launch speed whereas this
[12:22] has two columns so it's rounded hit
[12:25] speed and then just hit speed with a
[12:27] decimal and then we have a player
[12:31] name we have hit distance xba um hit
[12:35] angle Barrel hit coordinate X hit
[12:38] coordinate X in feet and then hit
[12:41] coordinate Y and then hit coordinate Y
[12:43] in
[12:44] feet and then here's an interesting one
[12:47] too with the data that's in
[12:50] there if it's played at an MLB Ballpark
[12:53] it'll tell
[12:55] you how many ballparks would have had
[12:58] that as a home run
[13:00] now you see the column bat
[13:03] speed there's some bat speed there some
[13:06] bat speed but not a whole lot a lot of
[13:09] missing data with bat speed just be wary
[13:12] of it don't expect a lot of data with
[13:14] bad speed but there is bat speed for
[13:17] college level games at a very limited
[13:23] level and then it tells you if there's a
[13:25] runner on first runner on second runner
[13:27] on third which I think is useful
[13:32] um very various other things so game
[13:36] total pitches you know what player how
[13:39] many total pitches he
[13:41] has um from each pitch type as well as
[13:46] you know this pitch number ball and play
[13:48] out and then there's this neat little
[13:51] column called is
[13:54] sword and so we can calculate that you
[13:57] know using fals or true with is sword so
[14:01] that that's something really interesting
[14:03] to see something that is in here that
[14:05] isn't in your baseball Savant statcast
[14:10] data set is your induced vertical break
[14:14] so the induced break
[14:16] Z so the stack ass data set from MLB and
[14:20] tripa a so the minor links as well it
[14:22] has this but it doesn't have it
[14:27] for that
[14:29] particular um viewing
[14:32] ship and then you have your just your
[14:35] Brak X Brak Z and then your
[14:40] movement as
[14:43] well but then it's saying like with
[14:46] gravity and then with gravity nice which
[14:48] is essentially just rounding it then it
[14:51] shows you like the direction it shows
[14:56] you pfx with gravity and then
[15:00] pfx with no absolute value so it's not
[15:03] rounded so it's not saying like oh this
[15:05] player got 16 inches of movement this
[15:07] player got negatives because it's based
[15:09] upon again catcher's view so it's going
[15:13] in the negative direction or no yeah it
[15:16] catcher
[15:18] view it's going in the negative
[15:20] Direction and it even shows you like the
[15:24] type of direction that it's going in as
[15:26] well
[15:31] um so that's that's neat gets your
[15:34] acceleration so your x0 y0 z0 x a y a z
[15:39] you know vx0 V y0
[15:42] vz0 your PX and your
[15:45] pz it's got your spin rate it's got the
[15:48] zone that it's in plate time you know
[15:50] your your normal things it's just might
[15:53] be slightly different in terms of column
[15:55] names extension the bottom of the strike
[15:58] zone the top Strike Zone you know start
[16:00] Speed end speed balls and
[16:03] Strikes um is Strike swinging pitch call
[16:07] result code
[16:08] description pitch name pitch type call
[16:12] name call and then if you want to do
[16:16] like
[16:22] a previous thing though I think all the
[16:25] the data matches up so I don't think it
[16:29] it really matters but it's got strikes
[16:30] balls pre- strikes pre- balls again feel
[16:33] free to play with it however you
[16:35] want then you have events you know the
[16:39] short
[16:40] description result team Fielding ID
[16:43] batting ID team Fielding team batting
[16:45] pitcher name what hand they throw
[16:49] with batter name what hand they're
[16:52] standing with
[16:55] batter outs um captivating index with
[16:58] which I'm not exactly sure what that
[17:01] column means at bat number
[17:07] inning so it allows you to get all that
[17:09] play ID as
[17:12] well so this would be useful at the
[17:15] major league level in terms of it'd be
[17:19] useful to
[17:22] get
[17:24] the like video of it right because MLB
[17:28] has that video side of it so this is
[17:31] kind of neat if you think about it
