[00:03] welcome everyone into this pre-draft
[00:06] stream before this Fantasy Football
[00:10] Draft today I'm going to show you guys
[00:14] what you can do with the available kind
[00:17] of data that you can look at and then be
[00:19] able to build out like
[00:23] a fairly simple type of like metric that
[00:27] you want to use for your fantasy
[00:30] football league and be able to say hey
[00:33] like this guy is valuable this guy is
[00:36] not valuable so on and so forth
[00:40] so with that being
[00:45] said let's get right into it so we're
[00:49] going to go right into
[00:51] our open up our open up our library so
[00:56] we're going to start with FF analytics
[00:58] which is short Her Fantasy football
[01:01] analytics and then our next package
[01:04] which we'll just use D for now um if I
[01:07] have time
[01:09] I'll go play around with uh tidyverse
[01:13] and using other things like that but
[01:17] we'll start there so let's start
[01:22] with kind of what you can do
[01:26] in fantasy football so f F
[01:31] analytics
[01:33] um let's go
[01:36] home and we'll search up in the corner
[01:39] here FF
[01:42] analytics so that way we can learn a
[01:44] little bit about it and help us you know
[01:48] solve issues there so
[02:03] there's a way to be able to see
[02:18] that don't need to do that all right
[02:23] well what we can do
[02:27] is here we can go to help
[02:30] maybe instead of FF analytics we can
[02:32] call this function called scrape
[02:36] data and the cool thing about scrape
[02:38] data is it gives you kind of some of
[02:40] these options for now that you have to
[02:45] basically pull rankings and you know
[02:48] projected points across multiple
[02:51] platforms so here it's mentioned it's
[02:54] got CBS ESPN fantasy pros Fantasy Sharks
[02:58] fantasy football to Day Flea Flicker
[02:59] number Fire Fantasy Football nerd NFL RT
[03:02] Sports and alter
[03:04] football and your arguments are you can
[03:07] get positions you can even go down to
[03:10] defensive positions if your league is
[03:12] like that um I won't be messing with it
[03:15] anywhere today in today's stream mainly
[03:18] because again I don't I don't use that
[03:20] so use that and
[03:23] then season and week so you can see
[03:27] there in the season let me actually
[03:30] expand this a little bit more so you can
[03:31] read it
[03:32] better so kind of some of these sources
[03:36] you can scrape from we won't use all of
[03:38] them feel free to pick and choose which
[03:40] one you like I've chosen eight of
[03:44] them that interest
[03:47] me um because I know Yahoo is one that
[03:49] doesn't work right
[03:52] now oh which one of these one of these
[03:55] has like a pay wall so it's no longer
[03:57] accessible so there there's a reason why
[04:00] I don't pick some of these
[04:03] so we're going to go look at some of
[04:06] this other stuff as well so season week
[04:09] so on and so forth
[04:12] so let
[04:13] me
[04:21] first put in
[04:27] LinkedIn go home
[04:57] no it's not
[04:58] it
[05:00] share copy
[05:06] link okay
[05:10] so now that we're back in
[05:14] it first let me check my draft position
[05:18] before we get started
[05:24] there let's see
[05:29] all right looks like I
[05:31] have pick number seven in the draft so a
[05:35] little bit late
[05:39] but not something I'm really complaining
[05:41] about our league is a little bit
[05:43] different this year so this is year one
[05:45] of where we actually added a third wide
[05:49] receiver so a wide rece a third wide
[05:52] receiver is going to be a little bit
[05:53] more part including the flex so it's one
[05:55] quarterback two running backs three
[05:58] receivers a tight end
[06:00] a flex defense and
[06:03] kicker so what we're going to do is
[06:06] we'll just
[06:12] say um we'll just call this dat short
[06:16] for data and we call the scrape data
[06:20] function and our sources we go
[06:24] CBS
[06:26] ESPN fantasy pros
[06:30] number
[06:33] fire um let's do NFL can't forget that
[06:38] RT Sports and then Walter Football again
[06:44] that's not all the capabilities of them
[06:46] you can see here listed here's some of
[06:49] the sources you can
[06:51] see see I
[06:53] explain expand it even more but some of
[06:55] the sources you can
[06:58] see and I'm only concerned
[07:02] about quarterbacks receivers running
[07:05] backs and tight
[07:07] ends um defense is not
[07:10] particularly crazy to
[07:12] me and then we have season we'll just
[07:16] set it to null and then week also set it
[07:20] to null that way we just acquire full
[07:23] season data and of the current season so
[07:26] if season is null should be set to the
[07:28] current season
[07:33] now to kind
[07:35] of run through it it'll take a little
[07:37] bit of time it'll give you the URL of
[07:39] where they're pulling these projections
[07:41] so if you want to see for yourself like
[07:43] where those projections are coming from
[07:45] now it will be a PPR link and you can
[07:48] adjust it because obviously you can see
[07:50] there excuse me doesn't have a
[07:55] PPR this isn't a PPR URL they do have a
[07:58] PPR URL
[08:00] but um you can still adjust it
[08:04] so the next thing we'll look at is
[08:06] something that is
[08:08] called I think
[08:10] projections
[08:15] table and so what you can do here
[08:21] is you have your data result your
[08:24] scoring rules which we can adjust here
[08:26] and I'll show you how to do that briefly
[08:29] and then weights so like
[08:32] if this is something where maybe on your
[08:36] own you can figure out hey which ones
[08:38] you know which projection systems
[08:40] actually hold the most value and then
[08:44] you can acquire that data and then use
[08:47] the certain weights in the source
[08:50] weights part of the function or the
[08:53] source weights argument and be able to
[08:55] say hey like you know for example ESPN
[08:58] holds the most value so we'll give it
[09:00] you know a weight of
[09:02] 04
[09:04] um and you can click here where default
[09:07] weight so these are the default weights
[09:09] that are given so CBS is a 344 ESPN's
[09:14] 329 NFL
[09:15] 329 fantasy football today 379 number
[09:18] fire 322 fantasy pros is a zero I don't
[09:22] know where these
[09:24] weights uh originated but these are the
[09:28] default weights we'll just use default
[09:29] weights for
[09:32] now but then we can adjust the scoring
[09:35] rules because these scoring rules that
[09:37] are listed on there in the terms of the
[09:39] scoring
[09:42] settings
[09:44] um it's basically it's non
[09:47] PPR and I think they
[09:50] add a NE add a Nega one so instead of
[09:55] negative -2 it' be neg -3 for both
[09:58] interceptions and and
[10:03] fumbles let me expand yeah while I'm
[10:06] doing this
[10:07] like feel free
[10:10] to um you know ask
[10:13] questions regarding this because this is
[10:16] kind
[10:17] of interesting stuff but we get all that
[10:23] information now we essentially set up
[10:25] our
[10:26] league um and so there's arguments that
[10:30] you basically need to set up
[10:32] your data inside of a list a giant list
[10:36] where it's then a list within a list
[10:38] where we have different elements like
[10:40] passing
[10:41] rushing receiving so on and so forth
[10:44] so we'll do this PPR scoring we'll
[10:48] create a
[10:49] list add a couple lines just so I can
[10:52] kind of space it out and show you and so
[10:55] you need the argument pass which is you
[10:57] know you're passing
[10:59] data and you can add in like pass
[11:03] attempts completion so like if you have
[11:05] certain points for
[11:07] there or any incompletions pass yards
[11:11] which is a common nominator in most
[11:13] leagues you know 0.04 pass touchdowns
[11:17] are
[11:18] four um pass interceptions I believe are
[11:22] negative -2 and many standard leagues
[11:25] and then if your league has things like
[11:29] this
[11:30] this you can add it in there I'm just
[11:32] going to set them as default but I'm
[11:34] showing you like the options you can
[11:37] have for that so pass 400
[11:41] yards so you know some fantasy leagues
[11:44] might have points where hey if you have
[11:46] a pass over 40 yards you get bonus
[11:48] points if your quarterback throws over
[11:49] 300 yards in a game you get bonus points
[11:52] so on and so forth
[11:54] so it allows us
[11:58] to create
[12:00] that so it gets our passing metrics and
[12:04] then now it gets our rushing
[12:07] metrics and so we'll say rushing and
[12:10] we'll say all positions equals true
[12:13] mainly because again like a quarterback
[12:15] can run the ball a receiver could
[12:17] theoretically run the ball I remember a
[12:20] few years ago having John new Smith on
[12:21] my fantasy team he got a rushing
[12:23] touchdown because it was like a a Jet
[12:26] Sweep for the tight end um so what this
[12:30] does it just allows you to calculate
[12:33] like rushing yards for every position
[12:35] and we'll just go here so point one for
[12:37] every rushing
[12:39] yards again if you get bonuses for
[12:42] attempts you can put it in here so like
[12:44] attempts any rushes over 40 yards Rush
[12:47] touchdowns is
[12:49] six um bonuses for like a 100
[12:53] yards 150
[12:57] yards um then go Rush 200 yards again
[13:02] solely up to
[13:04] you whether or not you want to have this
[13:08] but then we'll add in receiving list
[13:12] again all positions equals
[13:15] true and this is where we can say
[13:18] receptions equals one you know reception
[13:20] yards equals
[13:22] 0.1 reception touchdowns equals
[13:25] six any 40 plus yards list is zero
[13:30] anybody that has 100 yards list is
[13:34] zero anything that has
[13:37] 150 so on and so forth so let me to kind
[13:42] of save time because I know whoever's
[13:45] watching
[13:46] this you know you probably don't really
[13:49] care much
[13:51] on
[13:56] um let me make sure I can
[14:00] sign into the
[14:02] chat okay so I do have the chat up again
[14:05] if you have any questions don't hesitate
[14:07] to reach
[14:09] out um with that being said like I said
[14:13] I will just copy all of this just to
[14:16] save your time because I know you you
[14:17] guys aren't really that interested in
[14:21] all this other information
[14:23] so I'll just go you know one by one so
[14:27] miscellaneous
[14:30] is you know fumbles lost or you know
[14:33] two-point
[14:34] conversions kicks from various yards so
[14:38] 19 and under three you know 20 to
[14:40] 293 30 to 393 40 494 50 plus 4 field
[14:46] goal
[14:48] miss I believe in our Le get negative
[14:50] one so we'll add that returns again
[14:54] return touchdowns are a
[14:57] possibility and then this is like
[14:59] individual defensive
[15:02] player these are the automatic defaults
[15:05] again like they have default scoring
[15:07] settings in there so just pulls from
[15:09] there and it shows you like the
[15:11] different types of indiv individual
[15:14] defensive players again if I can leave
[15:17] that as is it won't affect anything
[15:20] because my league does not have
[15:21] individual defensive players then you
[15:23] have defensive special team so different
[15:25] points there and then lastly you have
[15:27] the points bracket
[15:30] because teams will or your defense will
[15:34] lose points based on a certain you know
[15:36] amount of points they've given up so
[15:38] they've given up six or less fewer
[15:40] points um or no five or fewer points
[15:43] they get 10 you know 6 to 19 at 7 20 to
[15:48] 33 4 34 and up
[15:53] zero or excuse
[15:55] me anything seven and Below you get
[16:00] um 10 then so on and so forth
[16:04] so we get that in there as
[16:08] well let me make sure
[16:11] this spacing is good so now we can pass
[16:15] that PPR
[16:18] scoring and now what we can do I'll just
[16:21] call this as
[16:23] all and we'll call this we'll call the
[16:26] projections table and we'll say our our
[16:29] scrape which is just
[16:31] that and then our scoring rules again
[16:35] that's one of the arguments listed here
[16:37] and we'll say PPR
[16:40] scoring and then you have different
[16:42] average types feel free to play with any
[16:44] of them
[16:46] but
[16:49] um the different ones are you know just
[16:52] raw average a robust average which I
[16:56] believe according to the source code
[16:59] kind of takes
[17:00] in the standard
[17:03] deviation within
[17:10] deviations
[17:12] um and then weighted is again taking
[17:16] those default weights and then averaging
[17:19] out by those weights so giving more
[17:21] value to you know CBS
[17:25] over um something like fantasy pros
[17:30] so on and so forth
[17:32] so we'll
[17:34] do we'll do robust for now because I
[17:37] think that one encapsulates it pretty
[17:40] well so we can run
[17:44] this and we have the average type their
[17:48] play position points standard deviation
[17:51] points a drop
[17:53] off basically what their floor is in
[17:55] terms of projector points across all of
[17:58] the
[18:00] sources that we've selected and then
[18:03] their ceiling points the max points and
[18:06] then the points v stands for the points
[18:10] over a replacement player so think about
[18:12] it if you know like you replace a
[18:16] quarterback like Josh
[18:18] Allen this is how many points you would
[18:21] have above him if you replace him with
[18:24] you know your next available quarterback
[18:25] on your bench or on the waiver wire
[18:29] and then the floor which is again across
[18:32] those
[18:34] eight eight sources you know what's the
[18:36] minimum amount of points they're above a
[18:39] replacement player and then what's the
[18:41] maximum then like what's their rank
[18:44] floor rank ceiling rank um their
[18:46] position rank and then it's divided into
[18:50] tiers which we have you know various
[18:52] amounts of tiers based on position so 22
[18:55] tiers for
[18:56] quarterback um it looks like
[19:00] 22 for no 24 for running
[19:05] back so on and so forth more for wide
[19:08] receiver again it just goes
[19:10] to how the tier is calculated is
[19:13] essentially taking a certain point
[19:15] threshold and then going to the next
[19:18] lower threshold um based on these so
[19:23] like those these Point thresholds are
[19:26] relatively tight because you can see
[19:28] here like this person person's average
[19:29] points is 305 while this one is 311 and
[19:32] they're in different tiers so it's just
[19:34] basically
[19:36] taking the amount of data and then
[19:39] deriving um tiers within it to be able
[19:43] to say hey here's the you know here's
[19:47] the highest tier quarterback you can get
[19:49] think of it as like scaling you know
[19:52] like here's 100th percentile here's you
[19:55] know 97th percentile so on and so forth
[19:58] right
[20:00] so as we're going
[20:03] on continue to break it down again but
[20:06] you're like Robert where's where's the
[20:08] names of the players We'll add that in
[20:11] there here in a bit because there is you
[20:13] know unique little functionality that we
[20:15] can add but let me add in some other
[20:19] like metrics that we can add
[20:22] so one thing I'd like to add is ECR
[20:26] which is short for expert consensus
[20:28] range ing so basically each of those
[20:31] sites is experts where they rank them
[20:35] what's the consensus of that
[20:37] site amongst those experts and then the
[20:40] consensus across all Sites amongst
[20:43] experts so I think that's very useful in
[20:47] determining different things like what's
[20:49] the average you know expert ranking of
[20:51] this player compared to this player and
[20:53] then what's the standard deviation
[20:55] meaning you know is there a lot of
[20:57] variability you know like I know there
[21:01] might be a big change in terms of Kiren
[21:03] Williams you right because now he's
[21:05] taking he has been told that he's the
[21:08] pun returner even though he's the
[21:10] primary running back so there might be
[21:12] changes there or there might be a lot of
[21:16] deviation in ter or consensus rankings
[21:19] in terms of a guy like Devon Anan from
[21:21] the Dolphins
[21:23] because he had incredible efficiency
[21:27] last year but he didn't have a lot of
[21:29] value and so are the Dolphins you know
[21:33] with the dolphins how they run their
[21:36] offense I believe they're going with a
[21:39] lot of 21 Personnel this year which is
[21:41] two running backs two receivers and a
[21:44] tight end you know how frequent do you
[21:47] see maybe aan and moer on the field at
[21:50] the same time and then you know does hn
[21:53] take a big leap in terms of snapshare
[21:55] when both he and mostard are healthy you
[21:58] know the are things you factor in but
[22:00] you don't necessarily have to do that
[22:01] yourself you can kind of take the this
[22:04] way of doing it is taking the expert
[22:06] consensus rakings ideas and saying okay
[22:09] here's what we think about that
[22:11] so we'll add in that so add in
[22:17] ECR and another thing I like to add is
[22:20] uncertainty and
[22:22] so I will try to explain best I can but
[22:25] I will also show it here
[22:29] which basically it's just scaling the
[22:30] standard deviation tables variables
[22:32] averaging them and then creating a
[22:35] within position percentile rank ranging
[22:38] from one to 99 a score of one in case
[22:42] there's very little uncertainty and then
[22:44] a score 99 large degree of uncertainty
[22:48] so with that being said essentially what
[22:51] it's doing is taking the standard
[22:53] deviation of projected points across all
[22:56] those SES and the standard deviation of
[23:00] the I believe expert consensus ranking
[23:03] to then be able to
[23:05] say so yeah right here so it uses
[23:08] standard deviation points standard
[23:09] deviation ECR to compute
[23:13] uncertainty and so basically saying like
[23:15] what kind of risk is it with this player
[23:18] so if you think about it this way in
[23:20] terms of consensus ranking in points you
[23:22] know a guy that's low risk typically
[23:25] guys that are drafted higher will have
[23:26] lower risk so like mcaffer will have
[23:29] very low risk whereas like I mentioned
[23:32] earlier like Devon Anan might have
[23:34] higher risk um guys who are maybe On The
[23:37] Fringe so like you know thinking of like
[23:40] deep quarterback leagues maybe two
[23:42] quarterback leagues you know it gets to
[23:45] the point
[23:46] where there's a lot of uncertainty
[23:49] between who's goingon to start between
[23:50] Russell Wilson and Justin
[23:53] Fields so on and so
[23:56] forth but
[24:00] with that being said now so we're going
[24:02] to add in that
[24:04] uncertainty and another thing we're
[24:06] going to
[24:07] add is the
[24:10] ADP and so
[24:13] again what the ADP does is gets the
[24:16] player's average draft position across
[24:19] each site so you know
[24:22] maybe oh there was one example I think
[24:26] it was etn but don't quote me on that
[24:30] one side had etn in like the top 12
[24:34] another side had them you know just
[24:36] outside the top 20 in terms of average
[24:38] draft position so there's there's big
[24:41] differences there and so basically when
[24:44] we want to add that we want to
[24:46] encapsulate that and determine like hey
[24:48] like is there a lot of
[24:50] deviation within that and then
[24:53] lastly I know the the part you want to
[24:56] ask for which is adding player info
[24:59] so we run all
[25:03] this looks like it it
[25:06] ran and now we have certain things so
[25:10] like expert consensus ranking overall
[25:13] their position expert contestant ranking
[25:17] so basically overall you know across all
[25:21] those
[25:22] sites those experts think Josh Allen is
[25:25] the 23rd ranked player
[25:29] um Jaylen Herz is the 27th ranked player
[25:33] so on and so forth so experience it
[25:35] looks
[25:36] like I guess I don't know what they use
[25:39] for experience I can adjust that though
[25:42] right now I'll just add a mutate call
[25:45] here and say experience equals
[25:47] experience plus
[25:48] four looks like I had to rerun this line
[25:51] to get this
[25:53] one
[25:55] okay so
[25:59] we can look at that and say okay who has
[26:02] the highest ECR Christian mcaffrey makes
[26:06] sense um and then positionally we can
[26:09] filter that down too and you can see
[26:11] uncertainty obviously there's some
[26:13] uncertainty but not a whole lot let say
[26:16] the lowest uncertainty guy at least from
[26:19] this list looks like it's between AJ
[26:22] Brown and Jamar chase that makes sense
[26:26] and Justin Jefferson sure he has a new
[26:30] quarterback but he can still have a lot
[26:34] of confidence like there's a lot of
[26:35] uncertainty with Bree hall
[26:41] because you know he was relied on a lot
[26:45] last year and now you're coming back
[26:47] assuming with a healthy Aaron
[26:51] roders how much does his play get
[26:54] affected there as well so
[26:58] now we're going going into there like
[27:00] puka
[27:01] AA amazing first season you know there's
[27:05] some C uncertainty there saquon Barkley
[27:07] going from the Giants where he was
[27:09] essentially like the Workhorse to the
[27:12] Eagles where he'll be part of a dynamic
[27:14] more Dynamic
[27:16] offense you know how much does that
[27:18] affect because you know like goal line
[27:21] touches is an important thing he's going
[27:23] to be losing a lot of goal line touches
[27:25] especially if the Eagles continue doing
[27:28] this tush push with Jaylen
[27:29] Herz and so on so forth so rookies will
[27:32] te typically have higher uncertainty
[27:34] because you don't know what to expect
[27:36] out of them you know Devonte Adams Drake
[27:40] London Chris Olive Josh Allen has a lot
[27:44] of uncertainty and it's because now he
[27:47] doesn't
[27:48] have sure he he is a good quarterback
[27:51] but he doesn't have a guy like Stefon
[27:54] Diggs now remains to see whether or not
[27:57] Keon Coleman
[27:58] can fill in that role but again it
[28:01] serves the point that there's a lot of
[28:02] uncertainty here
[28:06] so now that we have
[28:09] that
[28:11] let's create
[28:15] essentially a value
[28:18] score and so what I'm going to
[28:22] do here is get
[28:29] basically number of tiers so we're going
[28:31] to say
[28:32] all Group by position and then
[28:38] summarize Max
[28:40] tier equals Max tier and then we'll just
[28:45] remove Naas just in
[28:47] case so we'll look at that and so
[28:50] there's 32 wide receiver tiers there's
[28:53] 21 tight end tiers 24 running back tiers
[28:57] and 22 two quarterback
[29:01] tiers so when we're maybe creating some
[29:05] kind of score calculation that we'll
[29:07] start
[29:09] now we can factor that in so there's a
[29:12] few different ways we can go about it
[29:15] and I
[29:18] think one way we can go about it
[29:22] is basically getting
[29:26] a um
[29:31] um maybe how above are
[29:36] they in terms of
[29:39] ADP so we can say
[29:42] like difference of ADP and we'll just
[29:45] say
[29:48] d8p and this is very similar to like
[29:51] your zcore uh type of you know
[29:55] calculation so we'll take that person's
[29:58] ADP and then take the average
[30:02] ADP of the entire
[30:06] population and then let's
[30:10] say oh let's then divide by the standard
[30:13] deviation of that player's ADP so how
[30:16] much
[30:17] deviation how different are you from the
[30:20] sample and then how much do you differ
[30:23] in terms of different consensus in terms
[30:27] of or different sides in terms of
[30:28] average draft
[30:31] position so we'll start
[30:33] there then we'll go to u m which is is
[30:37] like an uncertainty
[30:39] measure which will just take the
[30:41] standard deviation of a player's
[30:43] points and the standard deviation of the
[30:45] expert consensus ranking divided by
[30:49] two and so what that'll do is basically
[30:53] saying you know the lower points the
[30:56] better and if those are very you know
[30:59] again this
[31:01] is you can also use the uncertainty
[31:03] measure but we want to scale it to a way
[31:06] that points can seem
[31:10] relative
[31:14] then we have I know I want to
[31:17] incorporate something with replacement
[31:21] players so
[31:25] maybe we take like we call it like an
[31:28] expected
[31:30] points above a
[31:33] replacement because again like drafting
[31:36] these players you want guys with
[31:40] high expected
[31:44] over
[31:46] um expected over a replacement
[31:51] because that just means you're getting
[31:53] more points you're scoring more points
[31:54] in your fantasy league so on and so
[31:56] forth so let's start within
[32:00] there and you can simply just take the
[32:03] projected points of the value over a
[32:06] replacement and then take the lower
[32:08] level of a value over replacement which
[32:11] is the floor and just subtract those
[32:15] two
[32:18] then we'll call this like a a tier value
[32:22] component so like a
[32:25] TVC and we can say like
[32:29] you know case
[32:31] when position equals
[32:34] QB then we can take tier divided
[32:38] by
[32:41] 22 then position equals running
[32:45] back tier divided by
[32:49] 24 and then position equals tight
[32:54] end tier divided by
[32:58] 21 and then lastly position equals wide
[33:02] receiver tier divid
[33:05] 32 that way we have all those tiers
[33:10] mentioned and we can get that value
[33:14] component and
[33:18] then we can create like a score and
[33:21] we'll call this like fantasy value
[33:25] score maybe this can be like the initial
[33:28] which then we take the expected points
[33:30] above replacement
[33:32] player add it with the tier
[33:35] value um
[33:39] component then we can subract
[33:43] the um I guess the ccore of the ADP
[33:50] essentially and then subtract it by the
[33:54] uncertainty
[33:55] measure and then divide that whole thing
[33:58] by 10 so that way it's on a I guess a
[34:01] bigger scale because the scale will look
[34:05] kind of kind of
[34:07] different so let run that look like e oh
[34:13] 80P SD so
[34:15] now run
[34:18] it we have differing fanasy value scor
[34:22] so in this
[34:23] one you know this I like to think tries
[34:27] to take take in that player's ADP so
[34:29] basically it's saying like hey you know
[34:32] dra drafting Christian mcaffrey 1
[34:35] extremely valuable then going like
[34:37] Tyreek Hill one two could be extremely
[34:39] valuable so on and so forth and like
[34:42] just going down the line
[34:45] now the issue I kind of come across
[34:49] is I wouldn't really say much of an
[34:51] issue because the the
[34:54] value goes
[34:58] negative around player
[35:00] 53 you can kind of see here like hey it
[35:03] becomes negative value once that
[35:06] [Music]
[35:07] player
[35:12] is around you know pick 53 which in a
[35:15] 10-man league you know you're roughly
[35:17] five rounds in and you're only getting
[35:19] players with negative value now we can
[35:21] scale it to adjust for it and I can show
[35:26] you that here in a second
[35:29] but this at least gives us a good idea
[35:32] of understanding okay you know taking
[35:35] like Tyreek Hills ADP is you know 3.9 so
[35:40] roughly you know you round you round up
[35:42] he's
[35:44] a you know a fourth overall pick meaning
[35:49] if you take him at Fourth overall you're
[35:51] going to get a lot of value out of it
[35:54] Breeze Hall is a you know fifth overall
[35:56] pick you're going to get a lot of value
[35:58] of it Orban so on and so forth you know
[36:00] am manra so on and so forth so continue
[36:04] to go down the
[36:06] line
[36:08] so
[36:10] again are you getting a lot of value out
[36:13] of guys after the fifth round
[36:16] typically not
[36:19] really
[36:21] but we can then scale it so this is kind
[36:24] of like a a more of a like a playground
[36:26] session here because we're just going to
[36:28] mess around and you know figure out
[36:31] different ways to solve for this
[36:33] so one way we could do this is
[36:37] maybe
[36:40] FES scaled and we can say
[36:43] scale you know all fantasy value
[36:49] score and so you can kind of
[36:52] see this scale where a lot of it's
[36:56] negative there's a lot
[36:59] Nas perfectly
[37:01] fine but it
[37:04] creates of a more you know zero to one
[37:07] scale so like obviously this one is
[37:09] Christian mcaffrey
[37:12] let's let's be real with
[37:20] that so that's one way of doing it or if
[37:24] you wanted to you could do this as well
[37:29] and say like what's the median of the
[37:31] fantasy value
[37:37] score that's right there's na so let's
[37:40] remove
[37:41] Nas and so it's negative 0.91 so then we
[37:45] can treat that
[37:48] as
[37:53] the median value and we can just adjust
[37:56] it so that way it matches you know the
[38:01] original original median value meaning
[38:06] anybody who
[38:08] actually
[38:10] is in terms of fantasy value score below
[38:14] you know negative.
[38:16] N1 which now we get to roughly 109
[38:20] players so now we're about 10 Rounds
[38:24] in um now you get a little a bit more
[38:28] value out of
[38:29] that
[38:31] so maybe we can create another one where
[38:34] it's basically like fvs adj which is
[38:37] short for fvs you know
[38:41] adjusted we can say fantasy value
[38:44] score and since it's negative we can do
[38:47] minus the median value so minus negative
[38:50] equals plus
[38:52] positive run
[38:55] that now we have an adjusted fantasy
[38:58] value score for now more players are
[39:00] getting valued again we're roughly 109
[39:03] players in so in a 10-man league you're
[39:06] roughly getting to the 11th round where
[39:09] players are considered you know
[39:12] valued at their
[39:16] ADP so like some
[39:19] guys down here so like James
[39:22] Conor at his ADP of 52 is actually you
[39:27] you're kind of losing a little bit of
[39:28] value there like maybe you can go
[39:30] elsewhere in terms of picking guys of
[39:35] value um so on and so forth
[39:40] so looking at it in in certain ways I
[39:44] kind of find it
[39:47] interesting but hey that's that's the
[39:50] whole point of it finding it interesting
[39:52] so we can see those those fantasy values
[39:58] and see just you know how good Christian
[39:59] mcaffrey is above the value that he has
[40:03] based on his projections again these are
[40:05] all
[40:08] projections that are from
[40:11] CS CBS ESPN fantasy pros number fire and
[40:17] oh wait no am I in the right one
[40:20] yeah did I forget a
[40:30] I
[40:31] did I forgot to add fantasy football
[40:33] today so let's add fantasy football
[40:36] today and rerun this from the beginning
[40:38] so we'll pull all this data adjust it
[40:41] for PPR
[40:49] scoring and then go from there
[41:03] and yeah if you have any questions
[41:05] regard don't hesitate to leave something
[41:08] in the
[41:11] chat and so you scrape all these
[41:13] projections from all these different
[41:17] sites um and we're gonna just go through
[41:21] it one more time just kind of show you
[41:23] what's about before I head out and go Dr
[41:27] valuable
[41:31] players but then yeah so I I think it
[41:34] makes sense
[41:37] because after about I think it's fair to
[41:40] say after about the 10th round that's
[41:42] where you start entering like the law of
[41:43] diminishing returns
[41:46] like hey if I if he's not valuable at
[41:50] this ADP don't draft him you know if he
[41:53] is extremely valuable that's the guy who
[41:55] you should be drafting
[41:58] um you know the reason why guys
[42:01] are in their spots and being valuable is
[42:05] because of this you know
[42:07] like maybe you wouldn't think of you
[42:10] know if
[42:12] the adjusted you know fantasy score
[42:16] value or fantasy value
[42:18] score of bejan Robinson you know if he
[42:21] was the consensus
[42:23] one it would be a lot lower whereas
[42:27] for mcaffrey it's a lot
[42:30] higher now we do
[42:33] that PPR scoring again we'll do robust
[42:38] averages mainly because again
[42:41] deviation we'll add in ECR uncertainty
[42:45] risk ADP again very important player
[42:48] info get
[42:52] tiers looks like they didn't change
[42:54] except tight end did change so tight end
[42:56] actually added three three more tiers as
[42:59] a quarterback dropped a
[43:04] tier and we run this
[43:07] again we should still
[43:10] get you know more or less the same so
[43:14] now this one values jir Gibbs a little
[43:17] bit more cidi lamb a little bit
[43:20] less uh so on and so
[43:25] forth meaning again it's valued at so
[43:28] basically it's saying like hey if it's a
[43:32] positive number it's meaning hey at his
[43:34] average draft position he would be
[43:37] considered
[43:40] valuable so if he's around four maybe
[43:44] treat that as like the minimum it's one
[43:45] way to think about it hey if you know
[43:48] Tyreek Hill is a minimum of four he's
[43:51] going to get a lot of value now with a
[43:53] number like 11 you'll still see positive
[43:55] value
[43:59] with you know within that ADP and you
[44:02] can build out another way you can kind
[44:04] of think about this too is create like a
[44:07] model just
[44:09] say
[44:11] LM you know
[44:15] um fds
[44:18] adjusted equals
[44:20] [Music]
[44:23] the we'll say the 0p
[44:28] and then data is
[44:32] all
[44:34] and get the summary so yeah that's
[44:36] obviously very important then we can
[44:42] predict their you know adjusted fantasy
[44:46] value so
[44:51] if if let's say
[44:58] or excuse I I think no wait I think I
[45:01] did it the other
[45:06] way yeah I did it the other way around
[45:09] so we can say
[45:12] predict our model and then we'll just do
[45:15] a tibble by saying you
[45:18] know their fantasy
[45:21] value adjusted so like CD lamb it's a
[45:25] five point
[45:28] six4 we'll just round
[45:31] it and then type equals
[45:38] response so that's
[45:43] saying interesting that's saying his EDP
[45:46] is should be 46 which we both know
[45:50] that's
[45:51] not that's not right
[45:58] okay but we can we can scrap that um
[46:02] because I know I I won't have enough
[46:04] time to actually kind of debug it in a
[46:07] way but it gives you that that
[46:11] players adjusted fantasy value
[46:15] score and then being able to say hey
[46:17] like at
[46:18] this would I draft this person at this
[46:23] ADP and if there is a lot of value
[46:28] then
[46:29] yes we should so on and so forth
[46:32] so that is about all I have um feel free
[46:37] to like this or if you want to see more
[46:40] content like this you know don't
[46:43] hesitate to be like hey I I want to see
[46:45] more content like this you know maybe
[46:48] hey can you show me how to make a GT
[46:49] table of this hey can you show me how to
[46:52] make a shiny app out of this I'd be more
[46:54] than happy to do it you know this is
[46:57] part of it is just hey you just got to
[46:59] ask hey can can you make something out
[47:02] of this or show me how to make something
[47:04] out of this I'd be happy to
[47:06] so that will conclude the stream
[47:09] hopefully you learned a thing or two
[47:11] about acquiring you know different
[47:13] projection sets from different sites how
[47:16] to set your scoring how to add you know
[47:20] expert consensus rankings ADP player
[47:23] info player experience so on and so
[47:25] forth and then be able to create a score
[47:27] that then you can use to model it but
[47:31] that being said thank you so much for
[47:33] watching I generally hope you have a
[47:35] great rest of your day
