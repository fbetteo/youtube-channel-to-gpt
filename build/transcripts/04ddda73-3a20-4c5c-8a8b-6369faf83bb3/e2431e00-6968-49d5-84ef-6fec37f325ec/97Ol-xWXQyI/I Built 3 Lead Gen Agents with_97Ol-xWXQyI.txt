[00:00] I just built these three lead generation
[00:01] agents with just my words. This
[00:03] interface right here is what's prompting
[00:05] me to use natural language in order to
[00:07] explain what kind of agent I want to
[00:09] build. So, I'm just going to paste in
[00:10] this request that says build an agent
[00:12] that generates leads for me. It will
[00:14] find the name, role, company, company
[00:16] size, and email address of people based
[00:18] on my request of industry and location.
[00:20] So, I'm going to send this off and it's
[00:22] going to start to figure out how to
[00:23] build this for us. Okay, so I think it's
[00:25] finished up. You can see all the
[00:27] different steps it went through. It had
[00:28] a few things where it had to figure out
[00:30] what to do, but it did. And ultimately,
[00:32] we came over to this workflow where we
[00:34] have these three nodes. So, I'm just
[00:36] going to say real estate agents
[00:39] in Chicago and fire that off. And then
[00:41] we should see it basically send that off
[00:43] to people data labs, grab 10 leads back,
[00:46] and then our AI agent should be putting
[00:48] that in a Google sheet. You can see that
[00:50] it very explicitly went through each
[00:52] individual person. And so I think it was
[00:53] a prompting thing. Gave us a quick
[00:55] summary and you can see the Google sheet
[00:56] now has 10 leads.
