[00:00] So, you're building with AI, but now
[00:01] what? Well, according to the data, 41%
[00:04] of you guys want to monetize AI, 26% are
[00:06] business owners leveraging it, 16% build
[00:08] purely out of passion, and the rest of
[00:10] you guys want to use AI to become better
[00:12] employees. Now, I've personally been in
[00:14] every one of those positions, so I get
[00:15] it. In this video, I'm going to break
[00:17] down exactly what I did once I asked
[00:18] myself what's next. I'm also going to
[00:20] lay out the options clearly so you can
[00:21] decide what's right for you. By the end,
[00:23] you'll have total clarity on how to take
[00:24] your AI skills further, whichever
[00:26] direction you choose. So, I thought it
[00:27] would make sense to start off by telling
[00:29] you guys about my story and exactly how
[00:31] I got to the position that I'm in today.
[00:32] Running an AI business with my
[00:33] co-founders called True Horizon and also
[00:35] running the largest school community for
[00:37] AI automation. I've always been very
[00:39] entrepreneurial in spirit, but I wasn't
[00:40] some teenage mastermind that built a
[00:42] business overnight that just absolutely
[00:44] exploded. I always knew I wanted to
[00:45] start my own business, but I took a very
[00:47] traditional path. I went to college at
[00:48] the University of Iowa. I got a double
[00:50] major in business analytics and
[00:51] marketing, so no formal coding
[00:53] education. And from there I graduated
[00:55] and was working a full-time job at
[00:57] Goldman Sachs. I was working in
[00:58] automation. So I became very familiar
[01:00] with, you know, thinking in terms of
[01:01] systems and saving time. But up to this
[01:03] point, I had hardly used AI practically.
[01:06] It was just your typical chatbt, write
[01:08] me a poem, fun use cases. Now, I really
[01:10] started to look into how I could make
[01:11] myself more valuable at work. And that's
[01:13] when I fell into the rabbit hole of AI
[01:15] automation. Because in almost every
[01:16] project that I would do, somewhere in
[01:18] that automation, there was a point where
[01:20] a decision had to be made. And I
[01:21] remember thinking to myself like, man, I
[01:23] wish I could just plug this automation
[01:25] into chat GBT. Little did I know you
[01:27] actually could. So I started building
[01:28] stuff in my free time after work
[01:30] learning other no code workflow builders
[01:31] similar to what I used at work. So I was
[01:33] pretty familiar with terminology and the
[01:35] concepts, but I just started making
[01:36] videos online posting to YouTube about
[01:38] what I was building even though I wasn't
[01:39] an expert. Now, what really shocked me
[01:41] is before I had even 500 subscribers and
[01:43] my most viewed video was like 1500
[01:45] views, I was getting a couple emails a
[01:47] week where business owners were asking
[01:48] me if I could help them build an
[01:50] automation or just sell them one that
[01:51] they had seen on my YouTube channel.
[01:53] Even though I was saying in my videos,
[01:54] you know, I'm just kind of learning this
[01:56] stuff. I'm not an expert. So, that's
[01:57] exactly how I made my first buck in the
[01:59] space was selling an AI workflow for
[02:01] 1,200 bucks just to help someone create
[02:03] LinkedIn posts faster. And the build
[02:04] took me like 2 hours. And this is when I
[02:06] got really addicted to building AI
[02:08] automations. As soon as I would get home
[02:10] from work, I would sprint to my desk and
[02:11] just start building things and making
[02:13] more YouTube videos. And I was doing
[02:14] this because I genuinely loved it and it
[02:16] got me really excited. So, I was
[02:17] passionate about learning rather than
[02:19] doing it to make money. It got to the
[02:21] point where all day at work, I was
[02:22] sitting there and like just daydreaming
[02:24] about building AI automations, which
[02:25] sounds really nerdy, but it's the truth.
[02:27] But that made my actual day job far less
[02:30] enjoyable. So, I really started to think
[02:31] about how would I like to be spending my
[02:33] time every day. And I realized that if I
[02:35] was making the same amount of money that
[02:36] I'm currently making, but every day I'm
[02:38] doing something that I was genuinely
[02:40] really excited by, I think that's a
[02:41] trade that anyone would make. So, the
[02:42] motivation wasn't to start making money.
[02:45] It was to do what I enjoy for money. And
[02:47] let me just like zoom back for a sec.
[02:48] Remember earlier when I said that I
[02:50] started learning AI automation to make
[02:51] myself more valuable at work? Well, if I
[02:53] were at a small firm, I think that very
[02:55] well could have been the case and I
[02:56] would have stuck around and looked to
[02:58] quarterback an entirely new initiative
[03:00] of AI automation within that company.
[03:02] However, I was at a large firm, lots of
[03:04] internal regulations. So, I just kind of
[03:05] knew that that was not going to be
[03:07] possible. And because I felt pretty
[03:08] secure with my YouTube channel starting
[03:10] to grow, getting some inbound leads
[03:11] consistently for freelance work, I
[03:13] decided to make a relatively safe
[03:14] transition and become an AI freelancer
[03:16] full-time. Now, in this era where AI
[03:18] automation is blowing up, and it ends
[03:20] starting to explode, you know, Google
[03:21] search trends, AI agents is just a
[03:23] hockey stick. Lots of hype comes with
[03:25] it. People start talking about how easy
[03:26] it is to start and scale an AI agency.
[03:28] gurus saying, "Quit your job, go all in,
[03:31] get rich quick with AI." And that stuff
[03:32] didn't really resonate with me,
[03:34] especially with the way that I had
[03:35] actually made my transition from a
[03:37] full-time role into my new venture. And
[03:39] honestly, that's why on my channel so
[03:41] far, if you were to look through the
[03:42] videos, I haven't really talked much
[03:43] about the business side of AI. I've
[03:45] purely been focused on teaching
[03:46] automation foundations. Anyways, because
[03:49] I had a lot more time every day to do
[03:50] what I loved, my content, and my
[03:52] automations just got better and better.
[03:54] Soon after that, I made my first $3,000,
[03:56] $6,000, and finally $10,000 as an AI
[03:58] freelancer just doing one-off custom
[04:01] projects that business owners wanted.
[04:02] And I think that's a really, really
[04:04] great place to start because now having
[04:06] gone through that, I can say that I
[04:07] have, you know, had experience
[04:09] conducting discovery calls, scoping out
[04:10] projects, closing the sales, developing
[04:12] the projects, and delivering them. The
[04:14] natural progression from there was I
[04:16] started to think about, you know, I have
[04:17] these leads coming through, but I don't
[04:19] have enough bandwidth to take on more
[04:20] projects. So, how can I do more
[04:22] projects? That's when I started to think
[04:23] about bringing on some people to help me
[04:25] out. And because I had already filled
[04:27] those positions myself for some time,
[04:28] like I said, closing sales, doing
[04:30] discovery calls, stuff like that, I knew
[04:32] exactly what I'd be looking for in a
[04:34] salesperson or developer when I start to
[04:36] make those hires. I also then started to
[04:38] think about the fact that I was selling
[04:39] these things for a onetime fee when
[04:41] there may be an opportunity to sell AI
[04:42] as a solution and work on longerterm
[04:44] partnerships rather than handing someone
[04:46] over a JSON file template that I had
[04:48] built and then we go our separate ways.
[04:50] And the key mindset shift for me was
[04:52] learning to diagnose problems and then
[04:54] pitch how I can help them solve that
[04:56] problem with AI rather than just selling
[04:58] a template to tons of different people,
[05:00] especially nowadays with how
[05:01] commoditized AI automation templates are
[05:04] becoming. And that's not even to say
[05:05] that that is the best business model and
[05:07] that's what you guys should all do or
[05:08] like that I've cracked the code or
[05:09] something because obviously bespoke and
[05:11] custom solutions are not nearly as
[05:13] scalable as a product. Anyways, my point
[05:15] being I started as an AI builder
[05:17] passionate about learning and wanting to
[05:18] make myself a more valuable worker. I
[05:20] started to see the demand as an AI
[05:22] freelancer making some side income and
[05:23] then went full-time on learning and
[05:25] taking on projects. Then I stepped into
[05:27] a role as an AI consultant and met up
[05:29] with my co-founders and we started
[05:30] hiring for other gaps. But I'm sure
[05:32] you're wondering now, how does this
[05:33] apply to you? And does monetizing your
[05:35] skill make sense in your specific
[05:37] situation? That's what we'll take a look
[05:38] at now. There are different ways to
[05:39] think about monetization and I think
[05:41] that the way that you think about it
[05:43] depends on where you are in life. If
[05:45] you're passionate about AI and you're
[05:46] starting to learn, monetization
[05:48] validates that you have a skill that
[05:50] people are willing to pay you for. And
[05:52] this money obviously will allow you to
[05:54] dedicate more time or resources to these
[05:56] passion projects, which is a great place
[05:57] to start out, especially if you're not
[05:59] yet looking to make this some sort of
[06:01] full-time job or create a new company
[06:03] because this extra income can give you
[06:05] some more freedom. Now, if you're an
[06:06] aspiring entrepreneur, you're building
[06:08] the skill set of AI automation that is
[06:10] in extremely high demand and will be for
[06:12] a long time with a relatively low supply
[06:14] of good people right now, which means
[06:15] you can build a business around this if
[06:17] you take it one step at a time. In my
[06:18] mind, what that looks like is wearing
[06:20] all the hats to start. Sort of like I
[06:22] touched on earlier, genuinely being
[06:24] excited about what you're doing. And
[06:26] then finally, probably most importantly,
[06:27] is that knowing what you're building
[06:29] provides value and being able to
[06:31] communicate that value very, very
[06:33] clearly. From there, I would say you
[06:35] want to go get a partner or co-founder,
[06:36] especially if this is your first time
[06:38] building a business. Trust me, it's just
[06:39] going to make it 10 times better. If
[06:41] you're a business owner, this one should
[06:42] be pretty clear, too. Automating your
[06:44] work and using AI to make your company
[06:46] more efficient is going to save everyone
[06:47] time, focus, and energy. And you can use
[06:50] all that time, focus, and energy to grow
[06:52] the business more. And finally, if
[06:53] you're an employee, do what I plan to
[06:55] do, which was make myself more
[06:57] efficient, a superhuman when it comes to
[06:58] productivity. This will naturally lead
[07:00] to you getting promoted, getting paid
[07:02] more, adding more value to your company,
[07:04] and never getting replaced. So now you
[07:06] know why monetization makes sense, but
[07:07] you still may be wondering which path
[07:09] you should take. So if building with AI
[07:11] is something that you're passionate
[07:12] about, you need to ask yourself, do you
[07:14] enjoy it more than your day job? Would
[07:15] you want to do it all day long? If yes,
[07:17] then start as an AI freelancer after
[07:19] work, going at your own pace, getting
[07:21] some experience, making some money on
[07:22] the side. Once you feel comfortable with
[07:24] it, then become an AI consultant. If you
[07:26] want to make money with AI as an
[07:27] aspiring entrepreneur, it's great to be
[07:29] committed, but don't just recklessly
[07:31] jump in. Take gradual steps. And because
[07:33] of all the hype and because of stuff you
[07:35] may be seeing online, it may seem like
[07:36] this space is a gold mine and that it's
[07:38] really easy to build a business that can
[07:40] run on autopilot. But don't just quit
[07:42] and take that gamble. Get proof of
[07:43] concept. Learn to build and sell
[07:45] automations as an AI freelancer. Then
[07:46] become an AI consultant. You'd much
[07:48] rather be a doctor than a pharmacist.
[07:50] help people diagnose the problem and
[07:52] provide them a solution rather than just
[07:54] giving them something that someone else
[07:55] told them that they needed. And if
[07:57] you're a business owner already, start
[07:58] to leverage a automations step by step.
[08:00] Think about what is something that I do
[08:02] every single day or that my employees do
[08:04] every single day and look to automate
[08:06] that process. After that, just do it
[08:08] again. What's something that we're still
[08:09] doing every day or still happening every
[08:11] week? Then automate that process. Just
[08:12] make sure you're understanding the value
[08:14] of these automations and how much time
[08:15] you're saving your business. And before
[08:17] you know it, you're your own AI
[08:19] consultant. And if you're an employee,
[08:20] write down each area of your role that
[08:22] AI can be used and then start
[08:24] implementing it there. Start educating
[08:25] other people on your team how they can
[08:27] leverage AI and custom automations to
[08:29] make them 10 times more productive as
[08:31] well. Eventually, you'll be viewed as an
[08:33] AI expert at work, and everyone will
[08:34] understand how valuable you are to that
[08:37] business. Now, for the part you've all
[08:38] been waiting for. Many of you love to
[08:40] see real examples and use cases where
[08:42] people do this practically. So, I went
[08:44] to my community and I found an example
[08:45] of every type of person using AI in some
[08:48] way that followed these paths. So, the
[08:50] first bucket that we touched on was
[08:52] selling AI without going full-blown
[08:54] business owner, kind of as an AI
[08:56] freelancer. Dan built a finance focused
[08:58] workflow that does a budget versus
[08:59] actual analysis and identifies key
[09:01] drivers behind these variances. He
[09:03] shared this build on LinkedIn and
[09:05] started to receive tons of positive
[09:06] feedback, leads, and even a job offer.
[09:08] And I don't think he had built up a huge
[09:10] following or personal brand beforehand.
[09:12] Most importantly, this LinkedIn post led
[09:14] to his first client as an AI freelancer.
[09:15] The goal of the system is to save them
[09:17] over 10 hours a month on manual
[09:19] financial planning and analysis work.
[09:20] Really goes to show the power of putting
[09:21] yourself out there and creating content,
[09:23] even if it's not YouTube or, you know,
[09:25] you don't feel comfortable showing your
[09:26] face, that sort of thing. You can write
[09:27] articles on LinkedIn, Medium, and still
[09:30] get your brand out there. Dan was
[09:32] literally able to get a client to reach
[09:33] out to him, hand him money, and even if
[09:35] he didn't get his first lead from this
[09:37] project, he still built himself a system
[09:39] that he can use every week. My point
[09:41] being, if you're going to go through the
[09:42] process of building out a system either
[09:43] way, you may as well document it and
[09:45] share it with some people. If your first
[09:47] thought is like, you know, imposter
[09:48] syndrome and why should I be putting
[09:49] content out there if I'm not an expert?
[09:51] Take it from me. Take it from Dan. And
[09:52] think about everyone else in your shoes
[09:54] that feels like they're not an expert,
[09:55] but they're looking to do stuff in this
[09:56] space. They're going to really relate
[09:57] with your content and have a lot more
[09:59] trust in you because you're showing
[10:00] everyone that you are a human being. All
[10:02] right, so the second bucket is starting
[10:04] as an AI freelancer and then launching a
[10:06] consultancy or some sort of AI business.
[10:08] Lars was able to do this by starting
[10:09] with his friends and people in his warm
[10:11] network and building them some AI
[10:13] automations that they could use. And he
[10:15] did this kind of, you know, as an AI
[10:16] freelancer. And now that he's gotten
[10:17] some experience wearing multiple hats
[10:18] and gotten some good case studies and
[10:20] testimonials, he's starting to launch
[10:21] his AI agency along with a team. He's
[10:23] also starting a YouTube channel to
[10:24] create content to generate another
[10:26] source of inbound leads, which is
[10:27] awesome. him and his team are not only
[10:29] delivering solutions like personalized
[10:30] LinkedIn posts, automated blog posts,
[10:32] and other type of content generation
[10:34] systems, but they're also diving into
[10:35] doing the scoping and helping people
[10:37] understand exactly where in their
[10:39] business they can use AI automation. The
[10:41] third bucket is a business owner using
[10:43] AI automation within their own business.
[10:44] Aiden was running a car detailing
[10:46] company in order to pay the bills. He
[10:47] was running local meta ads, which were
[10:49] spitting out leads for eight bucks a
[10:50] pop. He decided to build a system for
[10:52] his business where he could attach a
[10:53] lead form to the front of these ads. The
[10:55] leads that see the ad could then submit
[10:57] their information about the type of car
[10:58] they have and they would get back a
[11:00] fully automated PDF report that was
[11:02] personalized for how to protect their
[11:04] car. After he implemented this system
[11:05] into his own business, his lead costs
[11:07] dropped from $8 to $1. That's so insane.
[11:10] And then because he was getting all
[11:11] these leads for cheaper, he had to build
[11:13] a voice agent to be able to get back to
[11:15] those leads even quicker than he could.
[11:16] That's such a good example of how
[11:18] building an automation for your own
[11:19] business can really scale it, especially
[11:21] if it's just you working in the
[11:22] business. And finally, the fourth bucket
[11:24] is an employee who uses AI automation to
[11:27] improve their performance at work. Brian
[11:29] built an AI Slackbot called Vicki. And
[11:31] Vicki helps them solve a major
[11:33] onboarding bottleneck. New team members
[11:35] getting onboarded used to take 6 to 8
[11:37] weeks to ramp up and be ready to go. But
[11:39] now they get their answers instantly
[11:40] from a rag trained assistant, Vicki,
[11:43] that pulls from playbooks, SOPs,
[11:45] transcripts, stuff like that. After
[11:47] implementing Vicki, they have compressed
[11:49] the onboarding time from six to eight
[11:50] weeks to two to three weeks. That's a
[11:53] massive time save and a wonderful
[11:54] example of using AI as an employee. And
[11:56] those four members that I just shared
[11:58] with you, that's just a few examples.
[11:59] There are over a 100,000 people in this
[12:01] community. And I think everyone is
[12:03] looking to monetize their skills in AI
[12:04] automation in some form. If that's not
[12:06] already enough of an incentive for you
[12:08] to hop in and connect with some
[12:09] like-minded individuals in the
[12:10] community, I'm also going to be dropping
[12:12] this document in the community, which
[12:13] you can access for completely free.
[12:15] pretty much just breaks down what we've
[12:16] talked about today in this video and
[12:17] linking to those community members who I
[12:19] just featured. So, that right there is
[12:21] my free community. And if you're looking
[12:22] to take it even deeper, then definitely
[12:24] consider becoming a member of my plus
[12:25] community. In there, you're going to get
[12:26] free tech support. I do a Q&A once a
[12:28] week, but I think most importantly,
[12:30] you're going to connect with people that
[12:31] are also paying to be a plus member. So,
[12:33] everyone's super committed and building
[12:35] with NIDN every day. But anyways, guys,
[12:37] I would love to see you in those
[12:38] communities. But that is going to do it
[12:39] for today's video. If you enjoyed it or
[12:41] if you learned something new, please
[12:42] give it a like. It definitely helps me
[12:43] out a ton. And as always, I really
[12:45] appreciate you guys making it to the end
[12:46] of the video. I'll see you on the next
[12:48] one.
