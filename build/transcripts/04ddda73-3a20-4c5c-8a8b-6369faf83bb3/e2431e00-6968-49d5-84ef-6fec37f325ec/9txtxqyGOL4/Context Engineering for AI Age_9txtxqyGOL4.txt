[00:00] Here are my six context engineering
[00:01] lessons. After building over 200 AI
[00:03] automations, I've come to realize that
[00:05] context engineering is the most
[00:06] important thing in determining the
[00:08] quality and consistency of the AI
[00:10] systems. So, today I'm going to be going
[00:11] over the six most important context
[00:13] engineering lessons that I've learned,
[00:15] breaking it all down, and applying it to
[00:16] NAN AI agents. All right, just to start
[00:19] off here with module one, intro to
[00:21] context engineering, if it's a term that
[00:22] you've never heard before. So context
[00:24] engineering is the art of feeding your
[00:25] AI agent the right information that it
[00:27] needs to complete tasks effectively.
[00:30] Unlike prompt engineering which focuses
[00:32] on crafting the perfect single
[00:33] instruction, context engineering is
[00:35] about building systems that can
[00:36] dynamically provide relevant information
[00:38] to the agent. So in a nutshell, the
[00:40] agent should be able to receive some
[00:41] sort of message that triggers it. It
[00:43] should understand, I have all of these
[00:44] different tools. I have all of these
[00:46] different sources of data or information
[00:47] that I can look at. Which ones do I
[00:49] actually use to get information to help
[00:51] me answer or do the right task? Now, the
[00:53] problem is most AI agents today that
[00:55] aren't using a lot of context
[00:56] engineering, it's like having a
[00:58] conversation with someone who forgets
[00:59] everything right after you've said it.
[01:01] And the solution to this is context
[01:03] engineering. Because when an agent is
[01:04] triggered, it's going to initially look
[01:06] right at its system prompt. And that's
[01:07] what it's going to use to determine what
[01:09] to do next. So the solution is after the
[01:11] agent reads through its system prompt,
[01:13] it should understand I have these
[01:14] different tools that I can use to get
[01:16] more context and this is going to
[01:18] transform me from a simple question and
[01:19] answer tool to an actual assistant that
[01:21] can remember things and take action
[01:23] intelligently. And I just wanted to say
[01:25] that this isn't a new concept. It's been
[01:27] around. I think the term context
[01:28] engineering is a little bit more on the
[01:30] newer side, but it's always been around.
[01:32] These are videos I've made multiple
[01:33] multiple months ago talking about the
[01:35] foundation of AI systems and automations
[01:37] is data and context. And over here was a
[01:40] completely separate video where I talked
[01:41] about context is absolutely everything.
[01:44] The systems are only going to work as
[01:45] well as the data and context you feed
[01:47] in. Data in, data out, garbage in,
[01:50] garbage out. And especially if you're
[01:51] working on systems for a client or
[01:53] something like that, you're really going
[01:54] to have to leverage their subject matter
[01:56] expertise to train the systems to behave
[01:58] the way an employee in their business
[02:00] would. If you want to watch the full
