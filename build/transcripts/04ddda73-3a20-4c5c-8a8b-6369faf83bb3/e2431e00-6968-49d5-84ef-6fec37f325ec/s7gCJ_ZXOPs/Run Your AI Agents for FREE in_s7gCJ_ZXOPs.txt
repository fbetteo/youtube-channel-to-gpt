[00:00] Here's how you run AI models in Nadan
[00:01] for free. So, you're going to go to
[00:03] ola.com. I'll put the link in the
[00:05] description. And you don't have to even
[00:06] come here and download anything. Just go
[00:08] here, click on models, and now we have
[00:10] all the different models that we can
[00:11] actually download and start using with
[00:13] our Naden AI agents. And just to show
[00:15] you guys an example, let's do DeepSeek
[00:16] R1, which is a thinking model. And all
[00:18] we're going to do is we're going to
[00:19] click on it. And now we have a few
[00:21] things to look at. So, first of all, we
[00:22] have the different parameters that the
[00:24] open- source version of DeepSeek are
[00:26] offered in. So we've got 1.5 billion, 7
[00:28] billion, 8 billion. And just for
[00:30] reference, these are pretty tiny. GPT4
[00:32] is 1.8 trillion almost, which is just
[00:34] massive. Cloud 3.5 sonnet is around 175
[00:37] billion. So these closed source models
[00:39] are going to be much faster and more
[00:41] powerful than most of these open source
[00:43] ones. That gap is slowly closing and one
[00:45] day there will be open source models
[00:46] that are just as powerful as these. But
[00:48] right now that is the sort of limitation
[00:50] of open source models. And you're also
[00:51] going to be limited based on the actual
[00:53] local machine that you're going to be
[00:54] installing and running these models on.
[00:56] So I'm just copying the name deepseec-r1
[00:59] colon 1.5b. I'm going to open up our
[01:01] docker. And what I'm going to do is
[01:03] basically just open up the lama
[01:04] container and I'm just going to type
[01:07] pull. I'm just going to paste in what we
[01:09] just copied, which was deepseek r1. I'm
[01:11] going to go back into our local nitn and
[01:13] open up this lama node. And now if I
[01:15] click this arrow, we seek R1 right here.
[01:17] And now we're no longer accessing our
[01:19] local model. We're using our local
[01:21] DeepSseek R1. If you want to watch the
[01:24] full video, click on that play button
