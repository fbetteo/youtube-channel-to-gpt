[00:00] Watch me build this AI system to
[00:01] automate newsletters. So, I know that
[00:03] the first step that we want to happen
[00:05] after the trigger goes off is to do some
[00:07] research. So, I'm going to click on this
[00:08] plus and I'm going to type in Tavi,
[00:10] which is the tool that we're going to
[00:11] use for research. But now, we have to
[00:13] make our actual search. So, the query
[00:15] right here is where we enter your broad
[00:18] category or niche or topic of your, you
[00:21] know, newsletter. So, let's say mine is
[00:23] AI adoption for small businesses.
[00:27] That's what I'm going to put right in
[00:28] here. And this is going to stay the same
[00:30] every single time this workflow goes
[00:32] off. And now you can see we're going to
[00:33] get back three different URLs with kind
[00:36] of like some summarized content about
[00:39] small business AI adoption. So we've
[00:41] done our initial research. The next
[00:43] thing to do is use AI to create titles
[00:46] and topics out of that initial research.
[00:48] So I'm going to go back into the
[00:49] workflow. I'm going to grab an AI agent.
[00:52] And now we need to do some configuration
[00:53] of this step here. First thing I'm going
[00:55] to do real quick is add our chat model.
[00:57] So, I'm going to go to open router like
[00:58] we talked about. We're going to actually
[00:59] go to GBT 5 mini. So, now that we have
[01:03] the agent is looking at our three
[01:04] articles, we need to tell it what to do
[01:06] with these three articles. And that's
[01:08] where we come down here and we add a
[01:09] system message. So, real quick, I'm just
[01:11] going to make this an expression so we
[01:13] can open up full screen. So, all I'm
[01:14] saying here is that you are an expert
[01:16] newsletter planner. You will receive
[01:18] three articles from the past week. Your
[01:19] job is to come up with a creative and
[01:21] fun title as well as the main topics for
[01:23] the newsletter. And I can hit play on
[01:25] the agent right here. You can see now we
[01:27] have these things are in different
[01:28] fields. So we could actually drag them
[01:30] differently. So that's great. I'm also
[01:32] going to pin this data so we don't have
[01:33] to rerun our agent if something goes
[01:35] wrong. If you want to watch that full
[01:36] breakdown, then click on that play
[01:37] button right here.
