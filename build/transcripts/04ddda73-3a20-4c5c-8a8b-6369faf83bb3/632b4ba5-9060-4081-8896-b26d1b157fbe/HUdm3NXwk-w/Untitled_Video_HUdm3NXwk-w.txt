[00:00] today I'm going to be walking through a
[00:01] super cool multi-agent framework that
[00:03] does all aspects of creating a
[00:04] newsletter for you all you have to do is
[00:06] enter a topic a tone and a target
[00:08] audience and then it's going to do
[00:09] everything as far as planning it out
[00:11] doing the research writing the actual
[00:13] newsletter and then sending it over an
[00:15] email as you can see we have five AI
[00:17] nodes here we've got a newsletter expert
[00:19] a project planner a research team an
[00:21] editor and then a final node to create
[00:23] the title before it sends it off and so
[00:25] in this build we're using something
[00:26] called a sequential agent framework as
[00:29] you can see we have five different
[00:30] agents and the process starts with the
[00:33] form trigger and then it goes through
[00:35] sort of in that chronological order all
[00:36] the way to the end unlike something like
[00:39] some of my personal assistant builds or
[00:40] other AI agent Builds on this channel
[00:42] where we have like a main agent and then
[00:44] that agent has sort of child agents
[00:46] where this agent takes an input and
[00:48] decides which tool to use based on the
[00:50] input it's going to be variable it may
[00:52] not be the same order every single time
[00:54] but in this case this framework it's
[00:56] always going to be the same because this
[00:58] newsletter expert sort of plans out the
[00:59] table contents then this one plans the
[01:01] different sections to split out to the
[01:03] different research agents and then the
[01:05] editor gets it at the end formats it
[01:07] together gets all of the links and the
[01:09] sources correct and then finally we
[01:11] create the title so each agent
[01:13] specializes in a specific task which is
[01:15] going to help us get more consistent
[01:16] results over time because it happens in
[01:18] that specific order every single time
[01:20] and that's sort of fixed so they work
[01:22] together and they're able to produce
[01:23] some really cool outcomes as you can see
[01:25] here is a finished product um the title
[01:27] of this newsletter is the critical role
[01:29] of Mental Health and enhancing business
[01:30] succcess so I entered in the form
[01:32] response here that the topic was going
[01:33] to be mental health the tone is
[01:35] professional and the target audience was
[01:38] business owners so as you can see we've
[01:39] got 1 2 3 four five main sections here
[01:43] um there's different sources within each
[01:44] section um it's it's referencing
[01:46] different information so we can click
[01:47] into here we can see exactly where this
[01:49] information is coming from which is
[01:50] really cool and then at the bottom we've
[01:51] got a sources section with all of the
[01:53] sources that it listed that we can once
[01:54] again click into if we want more
[01:56] information which is just super cool but
[01:58] anyways if we were to read through all
[01:59] of this we'd see that it's really
[02:00] tailored towards business owners that
[02:02] way they could sort of scan each of
[02:03] these headers and if they wanted more
[02:04] information they would be able to click
[02:06] into one of the sources that we have
[02:07] right there super super easy and um yeah
[02:11] super helpful if you want to just be
[02:12] able to send out some quick stuff maybe
[02:13] to your employees or to your team so
[02:14] there's a lot going on here obviously
[02:16] there's like pretty much four different
[02:18] prompts that we have baked into this
[02:19] workflow so um I think the best way to
[02:22] dive into it is really just to submit a
[02:23] form and then watch the process go
[02:25] through from start to finish so before
[02:27] we do that I just wanted to say if you
[02:28] want to download this workflow for free
[02:30] you can go ahead and do that with the
[02:31] link in the description you'll join my

[03:09] a project for you or your business then
[03:11] please go to my website and book a call
[03:12] there and we can chat anyways like I
[03:14] said the best way for us to actually
[03:16] understand what's going on here is by
[03:17] doing a live example so we're going to
[03:19] hit test workflow the form submission is
[03:21] going to start listening and then the
[03:22] form pops up for us to fill out like I
[03:24] said we have topic tone and target
[03:26] audience so what we're going to do here
[03:28] is for topic I'm going to go with
[03:30] Health and Fitness for the tone let's
[03:32] just go with professional again um I
[03:34] played around with a few funny ones and
[03:35] it throws in some jokes and stuff there
[03:37] but let's keep this one professional and
[03:39] for target audience we're going to make
[03:40] this one targeted towards teenagers or
[03:43] actually let's
[03:44] say young adults okay so we're going to
[03:47] send this off and we should start to see
[03:48] the workflow taking place so the first
[03:50] thing it's doing is hitting the
[03:51] newsletter expert so this uses a
[03:53] combination of tavali and GPT 4 on Mini
[03:56] and what the newsletter expert is doing
[03:58] is it's looking at that form response
[04:00] and it's going to basically create a
[04:01] table of contents it's going to
[04:02] structure the newsletter very well um
[04:05] and then it hands off that table of
[04:06] contents to the project planner the
[04:08] project planner then takes that table of
[04:10] contents and splits out um different
[04:13] items or sorry different titles and
[04:15] descriptions for the different sections
[04:16] of the article looks like it did six of
[04:18] them as you can see one item left the
[04:20] project planner and then it split out
[04:21] six and so what's going on here is we
[04:24] basically have six different agents
[04:25] doing research because um right here as
[04:27] you can see we got um six TI titles and
[04:30] description Pairs and then basically
[04:32] each research agent is going to grab one
[04:34] of those and then use tavali as well as
[04:36] anthropic claw 3.5 to do research on
[04:39] those different title description pairs
[04:41] um so right now they're doing research
[04:43] they're hitting tavali to pullback
[04:45] articles get the URLs and um it's going
[04:48] to then merge back with the original
[04:51] title description pairs so in this merge
[04:52] node once the research agent team is
[04:54] done we're going to have six items of
[04:58] article content with URLs title
[05:01] description which is then going to get
[05:03] aggregated and fed back into not back
[05:05] into fed into the editor and the
[05:07] editor's job is to pretty much put it
[05:09] all together in a newsletter structure
[05:11] um make sure it all flows nicely it's
[05:12] going to make sure that we have our
[05:14] inline citations that are clickable um
[05:17] it's going to put everything in sort of
[05:18] like the HTML format so then the section
[05:20] headers are bold and all that kind of
[05:22] formatting stuff it's going to add a
[05:23] sources section at the bottom like we
[05:24] saw in that demo where we'll be able to
[05:26] click on all the sources that are L
[05:28] mentioned in this
[05:30] newsletter but um yeah so because the
[05:34] research team each agent has to focus on
[05:36] just one section of the article rather
[05:38] than the entire newsletter they're able
[05:40] to do a better job because they have
[05:41] just a specialization and they're not
[05:43] worrying about the prompting of how does
[05:45] the newsletter get structured how does
[05:46] all this happen all it has to do is get
[05:48] content and then the editor worries
[05:49] about that and then finally we pass off
[05:51] the final version to the um creating
[05:54] title node and then it gets sent off in
[05:56] Gmail so let's go look at the fin
[05:58] finished product from this run okay here
[06:00] we go so we got the Future Fitness
[06:01] Trends nutrition and health insights for
[06:03] young adults so we've got 1 2 3 4 so it
[06:06] looks like the editor only decided to
[06:08] keep four of the six sections the
[06:10] shifting landscape of Fitness Trends
[06:11] young adults should know so if you're
[06:13] interested in that you'd probably scan
[06:14] this you may able to see oh Amazon's
[06:16] offering up to 40% off on treadmills and
[06:18] walking pads that's pretty cool you can
[06:20] click onto that if you want more
[06:21] information nutrition 101 superfoods for
[06:24] Optimal Health according to a consumer
[06:26] report this green superfood can help
[06:28] combat oxid of stress okay um mental
[06:31] health and fitness Spotlight on emerging
[06:34] health risks let's say we wanted to
[06:35] click into um This research report by a
[06:37] Business Insider where it's talking
[06:39] about looks like it was talking about
[06:41] colon cancer in young adults um that's
[06:43] not fun and then you know we've got
[06:45] another one down here with um this
[06:49] Italian evening ritual has major health
[06:51] benefits here's why you should try it so
[06:53] as you can see we've got our links that
[06:54] we're able to click into which is super
[06:55] cool we've got our bold head headers
[06:57] right away so we can sort of scan and
[06:59] see what articles we actually want to
[07:00] read and um yeah that's pretty much how
[07:03] this one's going to look I also changed
[07:04] the sender name in Gmail to daily
[07:06] newsletter obviously it's just one of my
[07:07] emails but um just a taste of if you
[07:09] were wanting to set up some sort of
[07:10] automated newsletter and you wanted to
[07:12] be able to send it out to lots of people
[07:14] you could even set it on some sort of
[07:15] schedule you could have the trigger be a
[07:17] database where you just have a ton of
[07:19] rows of um topics tones
[07:23] and Target audiences stuff like that so
[07:26] it's really really going to be flavored
[07:27] here towards the stuff you put in but
[07:29] you don't even have to put in too much
[07:30] information which I think is super super
[07:32] cool so um yeah let's go back into nen
[07:35] and let's actually look through each of
[07:36] these nodes now and we'll talk about the
[07:38] prompting a little bit um you may feel
[07:40] like I'm going through this stuff really
[07:42] fast and um I apologize for that but
[07:44] definitely the best way to actually
[07:45] really understand what's going on here
[07:47] is to download this workflow like I said
[07:49] you can get it for free on my fre School
[07:50] Community Link in the description
[07:52] download the workflow test out a few
[07:54] form responses um and then just look at
[07:57] each node and see how information is
[07:58] passing through just like we're about to
[08:00] do here that's the best way you can sort
[08:01] of learn what's going on um so obviously
[08:04] for tavali we're sending that off to a
[08:05] different tool we we see this right here
[08:08] I'll dive into this in a sec but right
[08:09] now let's just focus on sort of how the
[08:11] data is moving through sequentially
[08:13] through this workflow like we talked
[08:14] about this is a sequential agent
[08:16] framework and then from there we'll look
[08:18] at sort of like the prompting and
[08:19] everything but okay so first and
[08:22] foremost like I said this this workflow
[08:23] gets triggered by a form response um
[08:25] this is what we entered into the form
[08:27] health and fitness is the topic
[08:29] professional tone young adults is the
[08:31] audience so from there we're passing
[08:32] this into the newsletter expert so real
[08:35] quick if you don't understand the
[08:36] difference between um sort of a user
[08:39] message and a system message system
[08:41] message is down here this is the
[08:42] instructions that we prompting the agent
[08:44] how to act its role its instructions um
[08:48] this is just the way that you're doing
[08:49] things and then as far as the user
[08:52] message this is going to be the input
[08:54] that's kind of dynamic that we're
[08:55] feeding in based on the form response so
[08:57] as you can see here we are giving the
[08:59] news that are expert the topic the tone
[09:01] and the target audience and then in the
[09:03] system message here's what we're saying
[09:06] you're an AI agent responsible for
[09:08] planning the sections of a newsletter by
[09:09] creating an engaging table of contents
[09:11] tailored towards the newsletter's topic
[09:12] tone and target audience the newsletter
[09:15] will vary in topic tone and target
[09:16] audience depending on your request your
[09:18] role is to use the Tav tool to search
[09:20] for Relevant topics and craft a high
[09:22] level engaging table of contents the
[09:24] table of contents should resonate with
[09:26] the target audience and encourage them
[09:27] to read the full newsletter and then
[09:28] we're just giving it instructions um we
[09:30] have our tool of course um different
[09:32] examples of what an input might look
[09:34] like um as far as like topic tone all
[09:36] that kind of stuff honestly this is
[09:37] probably way more information than we
[09:39] actually need in a prompt for this agent
[09:41] specific function it probably could have
[09:42] been done with like this much text but I
[09:46] was just using my my my um AI agent GPT
[09:49] where I just said hey this is an agent
[09:51] that's going to take these form response
[09:54] parameters and then create a table of
[09:56] contents so that's what spit out for me
[09:58] it's marked down um if you want to Che
[10:00] test it out you can get it in the free
[10:01] school Community but um honestly I would
[10:04] probably shorten this because you don't
[10:05] need it that much all it's going to give
[10:06] you is sort of this table of contents as
[10:08] you can see it gave us six sections and
[10:12] then yeah that was pretty much it it
[10:13] used Tav to go out and do an initial
[10:15] search just to see like what sections or
[10:18] like what's relevant that it could make
[10:19] sections about so that's why we
[10:21] connected this tool to Tav as well and
[10:23] then it passes that information to the
[10:25] project planner um as you can see here
[10:27] we just have a system message so this
[10:28] one's a little bit different different
[10:29] it's an open AI message and model node
[10:31] rather than using an agent because we
[10:33] didn't really need to hook up different
[10:34] tools and we didn't need like memory um
[10:36] we're just passing one thing in so let's
[10:39] take a look at this prompt it's it's a
[10:41] lot more simple your job is to split out
[10:42] the table of contents into an individual
[10:44] item for each section output section
[10:47] output each section separately in a
[10:49] field called newsletter sections and we
[10:51] just wanted to Define that so sometimes
[10:53] it wasn't coming out as like contents or
[10:56] um sections or headers or something like
[10:59] that so that way we could reference it
[11:01] later obviously but anyways when doing
[11:03] so keep in mind that the newsletter
[11:04] target audience is um young adults in
[11:07] this case as you can see on the result
[11:08] side and the tone of the newsletter
[11:10] should be professional here is the table
[11:12] of contents and then we just output the
[11:14] output from the newsletter expert which
[11:15] has the six sections right here um as
[11:18] you can
[11:19] see so the output looks like this we
[11:22] have message. content. newsletter
[11:24] sections so that's just sort of the Json
[11:27] um schema to get here and then we have
[11:29] six or six items um listed 0 through 5
[11:33] and it's just title description pairs so
[11:36] as you can see we're we're able to split
[11:38] that out from the input now we have six
[11:40] items of title description Pairs and
[11:42] then what's going to happen is we're
[11:43] going to feed off this one to an agent
[11:45] and then feed off this one to an agent
[11:47] and feed off this one to an agent so
[11:48] we're really doing a team of in this
[11:50] case six agents that are going to do
[11:51] research for us so we're splitting that
[11:54] out into this team of research agents
[11:56] we're giving them the title the
[11:58] description and then the target audience
[12:00] that it needs to tailor its post to as
[12:02] well as the tone which in this case is
[12:04] professional so here is the prompt for
[12:07] the research team let's take a look at
[12:09] it you are an AI agent responsible for
[12:12] delivering only the final content for
[12:14] one section of a newsletter Your Role is
[12:16] to produce concise well researched and
[12:18] audience tailored content based on the
[12:20] provided inputs with no prefacing
[12:22] statements or explanations so for
[12:24] context you have all the necessary
[12:26] details you want to create an engaging
[12:28] content um your content must be
[12:30] supported by research with sources
[12:31] clearly cited using hyperlinks so one of
[12:34] the toughest Parts about the prompting
[12:35] of this and the editor was to actually
[12:37] get those URLs back in a way that we
[12:39] could actually click on them through the
[12:40] email and get them consistently
[12:42] formatted um so now we kind of figured
[12:46] it out right anyways it's we gave it
[12:48] instructions we gave it the tool which
[12:50] is just one Tav tool um and then we sort
[12:53] of
[12:54] defined right here citation guidelines
[12:56] use Tav tool to gather information site
[12:58] sources for each major claim or piece of
[13:00] information include a hyperlink inline
[13:02] citation format citations as HTML links
[13:05] with descriptive text and then here's
[13:07] sort of the way you format it HTML and
[13:10] then when directly quoted from a source
[13:12] use quotation marks and include the
[13:13] citation so um that's pretty much what
[13:16] we're giving it here as you can see over
[13:18] here on the output it's giving us like
[13:20] article content um you can see like
[13:22] right here here's how it references a
[13:25] article so this is an article right here
[13:27] and if we were to click into
[13:30] here we can see that it is the
[13:33] page if my computer wants to load it
[13:36] there we go so we can see this is the
[13:37] page that it was talking about and it
[13:38] scraped the information from and then it
[13:40] made this section of content because of
[13:43] that that URL um so real quick let's
[13:45] look at the actual Tav request
[13:48] so what's cool is this is what we're
[13:50] getting back when the agent goes off and
[13:52] decides it needs to use Tav we're
[13:54] getting Source one here's the URL and
[13:56] then here's the content from Source One
[13:58] Source two here's the URL and then
[14:00] here's the content from Source two and
[14:01] so on and so on for each of the seven
[14:03] runs that it did so that's how it's
[14:05] getting information and then like I said
[14:07] it's going to merge its output with the
[14:10] um split out titles and descriptions
[14:12] from that project planner so we'll click
[14:13] in here we'll see what it looks like um
[14:15] as you can see we've got six items and
[14:17] they all have an output a title and
[14:18] description and they um align so the
[14:21] shifting landscape of Fitness the
[14:22] shifting landscape of Fitness all this
[14:24] kind of stuff um so this is kind of how
[14:27] the agent used these title and
[14:29] description to create this output and as
[14:31] you can see it did that for each of
[14:32] these six items um and then we're also
[14:35] for the research team and for the editor
[14:37] we used anthropic Cloud 3.5 rather than
[14:41] um
[14:43] gbt okay so then we had our six items
[14:46] and we want to aggregate them now
[14:47] they're back into one list of titles
[14:50] outputs from here we need to give the
[14:53] editor these titles and outputs to
[14:55] actually create the content so that's
[14:57] all we gave it was list of list of
[14:59] titles list of article content as you
[15:01] can see this is what it looks like and
[15:04] now let's look at this prompt so I made
[15:06] this one um I sort of handtyped this one
[15:08] out rather than using the GPT because
[15:10] like I said there was a lot of testing
[15:11] here and it had to be pretty specific so
[15:13] anyways The Prompt here is that you are
[15:15] an expert editor specializing in
[15:16] creating and refining content to Output
[15:18] a highquality formatted article you're
[15:20] given a list of titles and outputs and
[15:22] you will use these to create a
[15:23] newsletter tailored towards the defines
[15:25] target audience create a section in the
[15:27] article for each title with a hyperlink
[15:29] Source in each section based on the
[15:30] content so your objective just three
[15:32] things keep it simple create content for
[15:34] each title using the provided content
[15:37] simple each section should contain
[15:40] inline citations and then I put in um
[15:42] asterisk don't leave any out because
[15:44] before that it was maybe like some
[15:46] sections would have them some wouldn't
[15:47] and I wanted every section to have them
[15:48] so don't leave any out and then improve
[15:50] the flow of the newsletter and format it
[15:52] for readability sometimes like bullet
[15:54] points were being weird so just do that
[15:55] in there as far as citation management I
[15:58] put preserve all inline citations
[16:00] standardize your citation format ensure
[16:02] citations don't disrupt the flow of
[16:04] reading for the source section at the
[16:06] end create One Source section um at the
[16:08] end format each Source consistently
[16:11] include the complete URL organize all by
[16:14] alphabetically in alphabetical order um
[16:16] and then verify that all links are
[16:18] functional and then the output format
[16:20] should be structured as HTML that will
[16:21] be sent through email to not output a
[16:23] title or an introduction the output
[16:25] should start with uh the first article
[16:27] heading it was was sometimes outputting
[16:29] like great I was able to take your lists
[16:31] and here's the newsletter and I didn't
[16:33] want that obviously or it would say or
[16:35] it would create a title but we have a
[16:36] node that's going to create a title so
[16:38] anyways um yeah so that's pretty much it
[16:42] and then we just put important to Output
[16:43] a th000 words Max or else the automation
[16:45] breaks sometimes it was trying to Output
[16:47] too much and then the sources section
[16:48] would get cut off and it wasn't in the
[16:50] output and I was a little confused I
[16:51] thought I was prompting it wrong then I
[16:53] realized there was just like a cut off
[16:54] so um anyways then I threw in today's
[16:57] date just in case it needed to say
[16:58] something current so that's what the
[17:00] editor looks like as you can see we've
[17:01] got it formatted over here in sort of
[17:03] that that HTML format and then finally
[17:07] we just fed it into um this GPT 40 mini
[17:10] message and model node it's a system
[17:12] prompt where we said create a title for
[17:14] the incoming newsletter the tone of the
[17:15] newsletter is professional the target
[17:17] audience is young adults here's the
[17:19] newsletter and then we just give it the
[17:21] whole newsletter um and then at the end
[17:23] we just said output the title in plain
[17:25] text no quotation marks capitalize the
[17:27] first letter of each word and then we
[17:28] gave it an example example of how that
[17:29] looks and now we're getting it like that
[17:31] so that's pretty much it um as far as
[17:34] sending it off in Gmail I just put a
[17:36] fixed Gmail for now um rather than
[17:38] putting in an
[17:39] expression the subject is just the title
[17:41] that we got from that previous node we
[17:43] want to send this office HTML rather
[17:45] than text and then the message of course
[17:47] is going to be the output from that
[17:50] editor um and then I just changed the
[17:51] sender name and I turned off a pend NN
[17:53] attribution that's basically it so
[17:55] obviously there are a lot of different
[17:56] ways that you could really go into
[17:59] you're what happens to start this
[18:01] process and how does the process end if
[18:02] you wanted to automatically post it on
[18:04] you know LinkedIn or um some sort of
[18:07] blog website um or if you didn't want to
[18:09] capture it in response like I said if
[18:11] you wanted to have an air table with a
[18:12] ton of topics and every morning it would
[18:13] just run one that could be super cool um
[18:16] so there's different ways but this is
[18:17] sort of the main bulk of the logic um
[18:19] that we have here
[18:21] so now obviously the part we need to
[18:24] actually do the research um and we do
[18:26] we're doing that using a workflow that
[18:27] we built an ed end called tavali we're
[18:30] just saying call this tool to search the
[18:31] internet and this is referencing a tool
[18:33] that we built called Tav tool as you can
[18:35] see um so let's go over to Tav tool
[18:39] click on executions and let's just look
[18:41] at how they come through so for that
[18:44] previous run that we just did it
[18:46] probably it ran seven times I believe so
[18:48] 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven these are the seven
[18:51] runs and we can just see real quick the
[18:52] first one um came through and was health
[18:55] and fitness trends for young adults 2023
[18:58] the mistake here is that I didn't tell
[19:00] the because this was sent by the
[19:02] newsletter um this was sent by the
[19:05] newsletter expert because it was trying
[19:06] to get some Trends to make a good table
[19:08] of contents and now I realize in here we
[19:12] also need to give this guy the current
[19:13] date and time
[19:18] so because as you can see it thought it
[19:20] was 2023 so now that won't happen um but
[19:24] luckily nothing really changes too much
[19:26] but that's what the first query that got
[19:28] sent into Cav was and then these next
[19:30] six were the research agents each
[19:31] sending off a request to get information
[19:33] so the first agent sent off latest
[19:36] Fitness trends for young adults
[19:37] including Boutique gyms and outdoor
[19:39] workouts the second one sent off super
[19:41] foods for Optimal Health benefits for
[19:43] young adults third one sent off um
[19:47] mental health benefits of exercise so as
[19:49] you can see um young adults it knows how
[19:51] to send off very tailored queries and
[19:53] then let's actually take a look at one
[19:55] of the examples in the editor so let's
[19:56] go to this last one um recent inspiring
[19:59] stories of young adults transforming
[20:00] their health and fitness with
[20:02] significant Lifestyle Changes we'll
[20:03] click copy editor so it's going to pull
[20:05] up that run basically within our editor
[20:07] environment and now let's look at what
[20:09] we're doing in tavali so doing a post
[20:12] request to tavali it's a API um I think
[20:15] for free you're going to get like a
[20:16] thousand searches so it should last you
[20:17] a while and this is the base URL that
[20:19] we're accessing as far as the um
[20:22] configuration all we're sending is a
[20:23] Json body so pretty cool it's not even
[20:25] that in-depth you're going to put in an
[20:27] API key and then you're going to change
[20:28] the query so this is the only thing I'm
[20:30] changing here as you can see all we're
[20:31] pretty much putting in the query
[20:34] is the query that's coming in from the
[20:37] execute workflow trigger right here um
[20:39] so we drag that in there we just do some
[20:41] formatting to make sure it always comes
[20:43] through as string as valid Json we're
[20:46] getting Mac Max results three I had it
[20:48] first set to six I liked three a lot
[20:50] better it also was quicker and we're
[20:51] still getting lots of sources back of
[20:53] course topic is news all this kind of
[20:55] stuff um if you go to tavali right right
[20:58] here is the API
[21:00] documentation um you can see the other
[21:02] parameters you need to set up which is
[21:03] pretty cool so if we go to um
[21:07] examples like there's there's a lot more
[21:09] ways that you can get stuff back and um
[21:13] yeah it's pretty cool oh I was actually
[21:14] at the wrong one so here's the endpoint
[21:16] this is the base URL we wanted to do a
[21:18] search cuz we're doing a post request
[21:19] sending over information you can choose
[21:21] a Time range you can choose um all this
[21:24] kind of stuff and I just kept mine very
[21:25] simple but if you want to get more
[21:27] detailed in you can definitely go in
[21:29] there and play around with it which is
[21:30] pretty cool but anyways that's all we're
[21:32] sending off and then as you can see the
[21:33] output we've got our query and then we
[21:36] have a list over here which is um let's
[21:38] go to Json so you can see it better
[21:40] actually so I said I want only three
[21:41] results back as you can see we've got
[21:43] three results here's URL one here's URL
[21:45] 2 here's URL 3 and then we get like raw
[21:48] content title date content um and so
[21:51] from there what we do is we're just
[21:52] sending over that response back to the
[21:54] AI agent or yeah sorry back to the
[21:57] research team agent and all I did here
[21:59] was I specified the three sources we're
[22:00] getting back and then I just said here's
[22:02] the URL and the content for Source one
[22:04] here's the URL and content for Source 2
[22:06] and then same thing for Source 3 so this
[22:08] is what it looks like it's going to be
[22:09] super clean it's just going to be a
[22:10] quick snippet because we want the
[22:12] newsletter to be hey you know this is um
[22:14] an article or this is a section about
[22:15] this stuff a quick blurb if you want to
[22:17] learn more click on this link so that
[22:19] way you're able to scan and see a ton of
[22:20] stuff in shorter amount of time anyways
[22:22] that's going to be it for this one I
[22:24] hope you guys enjoy this is a bit of a
[22:25] different build than some of the other
[22:26] ones I've done but I really enjoyed this
[22:28] one one and I think that this actually
[22:29] could be a really cool use case um when
[22:31] you get in there and you refine a little
[22:32] more things and you make it a little
[22:34] more automated with the way that you
[22:35] have the workflow triggered um but yeah
[22:38] like I said I really enjoyed making this
[22:39] one and I know I went quick but um if
[22:41] you can download the workflow for free
[22:43] in my school Community you can really
[22:44] get in there you can read all the
[22:45] prompts you can understand what's going
[22:47] on you can look at the executions and
[22:48] see the way data is moving through each
[22:50] step which truly like I said is the best
[22:52] way to learn so as always thanks for
[22:54] making it the end of this one if it
[22:55] helped you out or you enjoyed it please
[22:56] leave a like um definitely helps me out
[22:58] out and I'll see you guys in the next
[23:00] one thanks
