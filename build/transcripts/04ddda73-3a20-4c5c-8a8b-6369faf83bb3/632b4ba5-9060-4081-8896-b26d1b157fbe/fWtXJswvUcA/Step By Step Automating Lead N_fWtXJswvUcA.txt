[00:00] today I'm going to be walking through
[00:01] step by step how to build this super
[00:02] simple workflow that's going to capture
[00:04] leads information and then automatically
[00:06] email them update in the CRM and then
[00:08] notify your team about this new lead
[00:11] this workflow uses absolutely no code
[00:12] and by the end of this video you'll have
[00:13] it up and running for yourself and I
[00:15] also wanted to mention that if you join
[00:16] my free school Community with the link
[00:18] down in the description you'll be able
[00:19] to download this exact template and just
[00:21] plug it into your own nadn plug in your
[00:23] own credentials and you'll have it up
[00:24] and running for yourself don't want to
[00:26] waste any time here let's do a quick
[00:28] demo and see what each note is doing and
[00:29] then we we get into the step-by-step
[00:31] tutorial first things first you can see
[00:33] that we have a Google Sheets trigger
[00:34] here so every time that a new row is
[00:35] added to our Google sheet which is this
[00:37] sheet um the workflow execution will
[00:40] take place and so this sheet is just
[00:42] responses from a Google form that I've
[00:43] made right here so it's very simple it
[00:46] asks if interested in working with us a
[00:48] lead will come in here enter information
[00:49] like name email what they're interested
[00:51] in their budget that sort of thing
[00:53] similar to a form that's on my website
[00:55] where um if people want to have me help
[00:57] them work on a project they'll come and
[00:59] submit this form form and you could
[01:01] attach this to different websites or
[01:02] different um groups based on a web hook
[01:04] within NN so that's how you could set up
[01:06] that trigger but for the purpose of this
[01:07] video we're just using um this Google
[01:09] form next it's going to go on to this
[01:11] wait step in this example we just have
[01:14] it waiting 1 second but you could have
[01:15] it wait you know 5 10 15 minutes that
[01:18] way when someone submits a response to
[01:19] your form they're not automatically
[01:21] being hit with an email it'll feel more
[01:23] realistic when um you know a human
[01:25] reaches out which is just the workflow
[01:27] rather than you know an automatic reply
[01:29] that's going to feel like a robot and
[01:31] then we have an open AI message and
[01:32] model node this one's going to actually
[01:34] create the email it's going to be very
[01:35] personalized based on information they
[01:36] submitted in the form and then it's also
[01:39] going to tag them as sort of like a high
[01:41] value lead or a hot lead and that's
[01:43] going to update within your CRM in this
[01:44] case it's just the Google sheet but it's
[01:46] also going to give us a status of the
[01:48] lead and tell them you know Sarah was
[01:51] reached out to at 12:55 on Monday and
[01:54] then finally after this step it will go
[01:56] into the slack node and it's going to
[01:58] notify you and your team about the lead
[02:01] and what type of lead they are so as you
[02:03] can see this workflow is currently
[02:04] active so that means anytime a form is
[02:06] actually submitted it will take place so
[02:08] let me fill out this form with some
[02:10] example data and then we'll see the
[02:12] workflow in action all right we have the
[02:14] form filled out with some example data
[02:16] we've got Sarah Johnson her email what
[02:18] type of services she's interested in her
[02:20] budget that sort of thing and we'll
[02:22] submit this so hopping over to the
[02:24] Google form we can see that this
[02:25] information has just populated in here
[02:27] so in the background right now nadn will
[02:29] be p this information and going through
[02:32] all this sort of logic so I'll check
[02:34] back in in a sec and we'll look at the
[02:35] email the new sheet and the notification
[02:37] and slack all right the workflow just
[02:40] finished running we can see we just got
[02:41] this new email so the subject is ABC
[02:44] Corp excited to explore top level AI
[02:46] options with you hi Sarah thank you for
[02:48] reaching out to ABC Corp we are thrilled
[02:49] to see your interest in our premium
[02:50] package and we can't wait to explore top
[02:52] level AI Solutions with you
[02:54] understanding that you're ready to get
[02:55] started ASAP we are here to ensure a
[02:57] smooth and efficient process with a
[02:59] budget range of over $10,000 we can
[03:01] certainly tailor our offerings to meet
[03:03] your needs and provide the best a
[03:04] consulting services available given your
[03:06] preferred contact time in the morning
[03:08] I'd be delighted to arrange a discovery
[03:09] call at your earliest convenience blah
[03:11] blah blah blah and then as you can see
[03:12] it's signed off Pam customer service rep
[03:15] ABC Corp so it feels very personalized
[03:17] definitely doesn't seem like an
[03:18] automatic message um especially if we
[03:20] added in a weight of you know 10 or 15
[03:22] minutes then hopping back into the
[03:25] original Google form sheet response this
[03:27] is the information that came through and
[03:28] as you can see it updated the status in
[03:30] the tag the status says Sarah Johnson
[03:32] was contacted by email on October 31st
[03:35] 2024 10:43 a.m. the team is also been
[03:38] notified via slack and then she was
[03:40] tagged as a hot lead so that's
[03:41] definitely important for you know the
[03:43] team to know and then finally hopping
[03:45] into the slack Channel as you can see
[03:47] we've got an alert new hot lead alert
[03:49] Sarah Johnson interest in the premium
[03:51] premium package budget over $10,000 and
[03:54] then you have the option to check the
[03:55] lead in Google Sheets for more details
[03:57] you can click on this link and it pulls
[03:59] up that sheet that we were just in so
[04:00] that was a super quick example of what
[04:02] this workflow does hopefully you
[04:04] understand what each node is sort of
[04:05] doing but if you don't don't worry we're
[04:07] about to build this thing step by step
[04:09] okay I opened up a new workflow now
[04:10] we're going to walk through each node
[04:11] step by step so as we know the first
[04:13] thing we always need to do is add a
[04:14] trigger and in this case it's going to
[04:16] be a Google Sheets trigger so we're
[04:18] going to grab on row added because we
[04:20] want this to execute every time a new
[04:22] row is added I think you guys understand
[04:23] that by now so the first thing we have
[04:25] to do in this node is to set up a
[04:27] credential so I already have mine set up
[04:29] but You' come in here click create new
[04:31] credential and you need to grab a client
[04:32] ID and a client secret so all you're
[04:34] going to do is you you'll open docs and
[04:37] you will go to Google Cloud so once you
[04:39] set up your Google Cloud account this is
[04:40] what it will look like you'll be in your
[04:42] console you want to go to apis and
[04:44] services you want to enable Google
[04:46] Sheets API so you'll search for Google
[04:49] Sheets and you'll click in here and
[04:50] you'll see that you can enable it and
[04:53] then once you have that done you want to
[04:54] go to your credentials you'll create a
[04:56] new um oo client ID and if you're a
[04:59] little confused used I made a video on
[05:00] this in my NN video I walked through
[05:03] this live I also did it in a couple of
[05:04] my other videos but it's not too
[05:06] difficult and then you'll just come into
[05:07] your client ID and you'll be able to
[05:08] grab a client ID and a client secret
[05:11] which is what you'll paste in here and
[05:12] then you'll just sign in with Google and
[05:13] it'll go green because you'll be good to
[05:15] go but once you have that set up then we
[05:17] can configure the rest of this node so
[05:19] the poll times is going to be every
[05:21] minute so every single minute this this
[05:23] node we'll check and see if any new row
[05:25] was added and then um after that we have
[05:28] to choose the document and the sheet for
[05:30] this node to pull from so it's called
[05:32] lead form responses and the sheet is
[05:34] called form responses one as you can see
[05:37] right here lead form responses form
[05:39] responses one so that's all that's
[05:40] happening here and obviously it's going
[05:42] to trigger every time a row is added so
[05:44] we can hit fetch test event right here
[05:46] and we should see the information that's
[05:47] in our Google sheet so as you can see
[05:49] we've got our headers and we have um two
[05:51] items here the headers are kind of
[05:53] duplicated and then we have this Sarah
[05:54] Johnson one that we just did for our
[05:56] demo and I took out status and tag so
[05:59] for the purp purpose of testing we can
[06:00] continue to go through and see this
[06:03] information but that is how you would
[06:05] set up this Google Sheets trigger but um
[06:07] I'm also going to add a a regular Google
[06:10] Sheets node just to get this information
[06:12] very clean for us so I'm going to come
[06:14] in here and do get rows and Sheet um
[06:17] same exact thing we just want to get Row
[06:19] in lead form
[06:21] responses and in form responses one and
[06:24] I'm going to test this step because we
[06:25] just want to get this information with
[06:27] the correct headers so right here as you
[06:29] can see see um it's coming through twice
[06:31] because it's feeding in from this other
[06:33] one so let's just delete this connection
[06:35] and we'll test this one again and now we
[06:37] will see just that first row that we
[06:39] want with the correct headers so this is
[06:41] the one we'll be using for testing this
[06:43] video but this is the trigger and that's
[06:45] how you'll set it up when you actually
[06:46] want to make your workflow
[06:48] active Okay so from here we have our
[06:50] information we want now we want to add
[06:52] that weight step this weight step is
[06:55] very easy all you have to do is you know
[06:57] set up how much time you want to wait
[06:58] seconds minutes hour hour days we're
[07:00] just going to do 1 second and we'll hit
[07:02] test so it's going to wait a second and
[07:03] then it's going to move this information
[07:05] on to the next node so as you can see
[07:07] here's our information about Sarah
[07:09] Johnson from here we're going to add the
[07:12] node that's going to create the email
[07:14] and tag the lead so that is going to be
[07:16] open AI I know I use open AI in most of
[07:19] my videos but um I just I like it I'm
[07:21] pretty loyal to it right now and once
[07:24] you get into this node you're going to
[07:25] set up your credential once again this
[07:27] one's a little easier all you need is an
[07:28] API key so in your open AI account if
[07:30] you don't have one go make one real
[07:32] quick and then you're going to go grab
[07:34] your API Keys you'll hit create new key
[07:35] you can name it whatever you want um
[07:37] create key and then it will give you
[07:39] this value to copy into nadn you'll
[07:42] paste that right there and you'll be
[07:43] good to go so once you have that
[07:45] connected the resource we're sending to
[07:47] this model is text the operation is
[07:48] obviously message model and then you
[07:51] choose the model from a list as you can
[07:53] see there's a lot of options with
[07:54] different gpts but we're going to do 40
[07:57] and in this case I'm doing 40 because um
[08:00] it seems to be the most consistent and
[08:01] kind of the smartest when it comes to
[08:03] making something like a really
[08:04] personalized message and that is what
[08:06] this node is going to be doing so that's
[08:08] why I'm using 40
[08:09] here the next thing we need to do is
[08:11] prompt this agent so usually when you're
[08:13] prompting sort of like a node you want
[08:14] to make it a system prompt because as
[08:16] you can see right here usually used to
[08:18] set the Models Behavior or context for
[08:19] the next user message so that's what
[08:21] we're going to be doing a system prompt
[08:23] here and give me one sec I'm going to
[08:25] type out a big prompt and I don't want
[08:27] you guys to see that so um I'll be back
[08:29] in a sec
[08:30] okay kind of a gnarly prompt here this
[08:32] node's going to be doing a lot of work
[08:33] for us so let's get into it real quick
[08:35] so I started off with you are a lead
[08:37] nurturing assistant your job is to write
[08:38] an email to a new lead who just filled
[08:40] out the form on our website which is an
[08:42] AI Consulting website so all I'm doing
[08:44] here is just giving it some context and
[08:45] some background of its job and some
[08:48] information your name is Pam and you
[08:50] work as a customer service rep for ABC
[08:52] Corp make sure your email is friendly
[08:54] and always signs off in a professional
[08:55] way you should never include any
[08:57] placeholders like lead's name your name
[08:59] your company Etc please only address the
[09:02] lead by the first name if they entered
[09:03] their full name so here's some
[09:05] information here um if you're wondering
[09:06] why some of the stuff is in here like
[09:08] don't include placeholders if you don't
[09:10] include that sometimes it'll sign off as
[09:12] like you know best regards your name
[09:14] your company or even say like hey lead's
[09:17] name so we don't want any of that to
[09:19] happen obviously that's very obvious
[09:20] that it was
[09:21] automated so then we come into giving it
[09:24] actual information so here's information
[09:26] about the lead we've got name email what
[09:28] they're interested in all this kind of
[09:30] stuff so that this node can make a very
[09:32] personalized email based on the
[09:33] information they submitted in that form
[09:35] so let's um turn this into an expression
[09:38] because it's going to change every
[09:40] single time a new form is resp is is put
[09:42] in so as you can see now it's very
[09:45] simple all we have to do is drag
[09:47] information from this left hand side
[09:48] into where we want it so obviously for
[09:51] name we want the name value to be in
[09:53] here so it's in this green notation with
[09:56] these two curly brackets json. this is
[09:58] just a JavaScript variable that's that
[10:00] just basically says okay this is going
[10:01] to change every time as you can see on
[10:03] the right it's Sarah Johnson and same
[10:05] thing with email it'll come through over
[10:07] here as um Json email address but over
[10:10] here it's you know my one of my emails
[10:11] Nate herk 88@gmail.com so we're going to
[10:13] do same thing Services interested in
[10:16] budget range preferred contact Time
[10:19] Project timeline and additional comments
[10:21] so now on this right hand side you can
[10:22] see we have all this information filled
[10:25] out correctly and this is what it's
[10:26] going to be using to make that
[10:28] email okay so continuing on with the
[10:30] prompt your email should be very
[10:31] personalized based on what they entered
[10:33] into the form you should thank them for
[10:35] their interest and they that they
[10:36] specified and include any relevant
[10:38] information at the end please include a
[10:40] call to action like if they have any
[10:41] questions or if they'd like to schedule
[10:43] a discovery call you should also output
[10:45] three Fields separately so this is the
[10:48] information coming in this node and then
[10:50] on the right it'll be information coming
[10:51] out of the node we want three different
[10:53] fields we want one for the email subject
[10:55] called subject one for the email body
[10:57] called body and one for the tag which is
[10:59] how we're tagging a lead you'll see that
[11:01] in a sec and this um this one's going to
[11:04] be called tag so the fields should
[11:06] always be called subject body or and tag
[11:09] otherwise the automation will break then
[11:11] I wrote the subject should always start
[11:12] with ABC Corp and then a brief
[11:14] description of the email that way when
[11:15] it comes into the email they they see
[11:17] ABC Corp right away and then we get into
[11:19] how you actually decide the value for a
[11:22] tag so high value lead the description
[11:24] is a lead with high budget interested in
[11:26] premium services or specific urgent
[11:28] needs I gave some indicators like budget
[11:30] over $10,000 premium package project
[11:33] timeline immediate and then just a
[11:35] little bit of a purpose and I did the
[11:36] same thing with medium value lead low
[11:38] value lead and hot lead so I won't read
[11:41] all these but let's just read um low
[11:43] value lead real quick so this is a lead
[11:45] with a limited budget flexible project
[11:47] timeline and interest in basic services
[11:49] or initial exploration some indicators
[11:52] um basic package under $5,000 budget and
[11:55] then you know pretty much same thing
[11:56] with all these other ones so it's kind
[11:58] of an early prompt like I said said but
[12:01] um it does the
[12:03] trick so then the last thing we need to
[12:05] do is output this content as Json and
[12:08] I'll show you guys exactly why so let me
[12:11] just say test step so we told it to
[12:13] Output three Fields separately subject
[12:16] body and tag and so if we don't output
[12:18] it as Json it's going to put everything
[12:20] in one field so as you can see it's
[12:22] called content and it has our subject
[12:24] right here and then it has our body
[12:26] right here and then at the bottom it
[12:28] should have our tag of hot lead so
[12:30] that's not what we want so if we output
[12:32] it as content or sorry if we output the
[12:33] content as Json and we run it again it
[12:35] will actually split those three Fields
[12:37] into three Fields so you can see here
[12:39] now we have a subject now we have a body
[12:42] now we have a tag so that's exactly what
[12:44] we wanted this node is configured and as
[12:46] you can see um I won't read this whole
[12:48] email but it's going to be very
[12:49] personalized it reaches out to Sarah it
[12:51] signs off best regards Pam customer
[12:53] service ABC Corp and um yeah it talks
[12:56] about exactly what she talked about in
[12:58] the form so we know that is good to go
[13:00] here so now we have the three tasks we
[13:03] want to do we want it to email the lead
[13:06] we want it to update that Google sheet
[13:08] and then we want it to send the
[13:10] notification in slack so first things
[13:11] first we'll do the Gmail node we're
[13:14] going to be sending a message here and
[13:17] once again you'll have to sign in with
[13:18] your credentials it's a little easier
[13:20] now if you have your ID and secret set
[13:21] up and then once again you'll just sign
[13:23] in so the resource that this node is
[13:25] doing is going to be sending a message
[13:27] sorry send message and then we have to
[13:29] just fill out who it's going to the
[13:31] subject email type and the message so
[13:33] first thing I'm going to do is turn this
[13:35] email type to text and now it's super
[13:37] easy once again just drag and drop so
[13:40] two we have the email that they were
[13:42] giving us from the original Google
[13:44] Sheets node so we can see the email
[13:45] address is right here once again we're
[13:47] just going to drag and drop and it's
[13:48] very easy and it fills in with the
[13:50] correct email subject now you can see
[13:52] why we wanted to get them in three
[13:54] different fields so that we can just
[13:55] drag subject right in here and it's as
[13:57] simple as that ABC Corp welcome Sarah
[13:59] let's explore top level AI Consulting
[14:01] options um and then for message we just
[14:03] want to drag in the body and that is how
[14:05] you know the email is actually going to
[14:06] get sent off as you can see it's
[14:07] formatted pretty nice like an email too
[14:09] which is awesome and then the last thing
[14:11] we want to do is go to append NN
[14:13] attribution and just turn that off
[14:15] otherwise at the bottom of email it's
[14:16] going to say this message was sent by
[14:18] nadn so we'll test the step make sure
[14:21] everything's working right here it will
[14:23] say that it was sent and then if I hop
[14:25] back into my email and we refresh we
[14:28] should see right here ABC Corp welcome
[14:30] Sarah um we've got the information here
[14:33] um you know it might mention her budget
[14:36] it might mention whatever it is but it's
[14:38] going to be a little different every
[14:39] time but you know premium package and um
[14:42] it's very going to be very personalized
[14:44] which is awesome all right so that is
[14:47] good for the Gmail node next thing we
[14:49] want to do is drag this out you always
[14:51] have to make sure all your noes are
[14:52] connected but we drag it from here and
[14:54] now we will do a Google Sheets node once
[14:57] again so this time we're not getting
[14:59] information we're going to be updating a
[15:01] row so there's update row and Sheet
[15:03] we'll click on this one here same thing
[15:05] you got to configure information we're
[15:07] going to the sheet called lead form
[15:08] responses we're going to the sheet
[15:10] called form responses one and now we
[15:12] have to map out what we actually want to
[15:14] update so this might pop up or sorry it
[15:16] will pop up but it might seem a little
[15:18] daunting but it's really not first thing
[15:20] we have to do is match our columns so we
[15:22] want to match on you know we could do
[15:24] any of this really we're just going to
[15:26] match on name um cuz it's it'll pretty
[15:29] much be unique you could also do email
[15:30] if you wanted but right now we're just
[15:31] going to do name and all you have to do
[15:33] is drag in the name from the Google
[15:34] sheet so it's basically saying anytime
[15:37] or when this gets triggered when it's
[15:39] Sarah Johnson it's going to update that
[15:40] row where the name equals Sarah Johnson
[15:44] and so all we want to update here is the
[15:45] status and the tag so we can delete all
[15:48] this other stuff so time stamp email
[15:50] phone all this kind of stuff we can
[15:51] delete because we don't want to update
[15:52] that we just want to update status and
[15:54] tag so for status what we want to say is
[15:57] um something like
[16:00] you know Sarah Johnson so as you can see
[16:02] I dragged in the name Sarah Johnson was
[16:06] contacted by email on and now we want to
[16:11] say like what time it is so if you do
[16:15] two curly brackets you can see some
[16:16] suggested things right here we've got
[16:18] now so as you can see this is just going
[16:20] to Output the current date and time so
[16:22] whenever this runs it'll say what time
[16:23] the email was actually sent but this is
[16:25] super ugly date time 2024 blah blah blah
[16:28] it's got all this stuff so we just need
[16:29] to format um this time so I'm just going
[16:33] to copy in this variable right here and
[16:36] this will also I'll make sure to put
[16:37] this in my school Community as well but
[16:40] it's a simple it's it's the same dollar
[16:42] sign now but then we just format it so
[16:44] two format all this kind of stuff and
[16:46] now we can see it's coming out as
[16:47] October 31st 2024 11:09 a.m. and that's
[16:50] exactly how we want
[16:52] it and then we'll end off that sentence
[16:54] and then just
[16:55] say the team is also been
[17:00] notified via slack or you know however
[17:03] else you want to notify the team so
[17:06] Sarah Johnson was contacted on the date
[17:09] and the team was notified and then
[17:10] finally for tag this one's easier all I
[17:12] have to do is go back to the open AI
[17:13] node where we had it create an email and
[17:15] tag and just drag tag right here so as
[17:18] you can see it's coming through as a
[17:19] high value lead and that way it's going
[17:21] to update those rows within the Google
[17:24] sheet so here's the response these are
[17:27] the two columns we wanted to update
[17:28] status and tag let's go into nadn hit
[17:31] test step it will say um here's the
[17:35] information that came through and then
[17:36] we go into the form and you can see this
[17:38] stuff was updated and it came through
[17:42] correctly all right so this node is
[17:44] configured now we just need to set up
[17:46] that last one which is the slack
[17:48] notification okay so once again we'll
[17:50] drag this node out here we want to
[17:52] connect it to a slack
[17:54] node and within slack all we want to do
[17:57] is send a message so so we got that
[17:59] right here under message actions send a
[18:01] message it'll connect to your slack
[18:03] account I'm pretty sure this one is you
[18:04] know you just have to sign in so it's
[18:06] very easy the operation is send the
[18:08] resources a message we're going to be
[18:10] sending the message to a specific
[18:12] channel so it's nice that it lets you
[18:13] choose I'm going to choose the channel
[18:15] YouTube testing and the message type you
[18:17] have different things you can choose
[18:18] from we're just going to be doing a
[18:20] simple text message very easy and then
[18:22] let me copy in this message real quick
[18:24] okay so here's the message we're sending
[18:26] new blank alert we're going to give the
[18:28] name the interest the budget and then
[18:30] the link to the Google sheet that we
[18:32] were just in so we want to go to um
[18:35] first of all grab our tag from the open
[18:37] AI node so we can put that right in
[18:39] between new alert so now we have new
[18:41] high value lead alert and then we need
[18:44] to just do the same thing we'll grab
[18:45] this from the Google Sheets node for
[18:48] name obviously we're putting in the name
[18:51] for interest we're going to put in the
[18:53] services that Sarah is interested in and
[18:55] then budget we can just grab our budget
[18:57] range um variable so as you can see over
[19:00] here it's coming in as new high value
[19:01] lead alert Sarah Johnson interested in
[19:03] the premium package her budget's over
[19:05] $110,000 and then if you need more
[19:07] details you can click on this link and
[19:08] it will take you back to that original
[19:11] form response from
[19:12] her and then the last thing we want to
[19:14] do here is um include link to workflow
[19:18] and turn that
[19:19] off this will just ensure that the
[19:21] message comes to very clean actually
[19:22] I'll turn it on and show you guys what
[19:24] happens if you don't do that so the
[19:26] message got sent we'll go into the slack
[19:28] and as you can see see at the bottom it
[19:29] says automated with this NN workflow
[19:31] which is kind of cool you can click on
[19:32] it and see the workflow but we want it
[19:34] to be a clean message like this one so
[19:37] we'll hop back in nnn turn this off test
[19:39] the step again and now you can see this
[19:41] most recent message there's no automated
[19:43] message at the bottom so that's coming
[19:45] through nicely and really that's it as
[19:48] far as like what we wanted to set up um
[19:51] You probably just want to label your
[19:52] nodes I labeled these two and um we'll
[19:54] just call this one like notify team
[20:00] but yeah um that is all that we have
[20:02] really
[20:03] so we will actually hook up this Google
[20:07] Sheets trigger now and resave this and
[20:11] now we can see um another live version
[20:14] of this stuff coming through so let me
[20:16] just make this one
[20:18] active Okay so we've got it this one's
[20:20] activated and so we've seen Sarah
[20:21] Johnson's information come through let
[20:24] me go in here and submit another
[20:25] response and we'll make this one U maybe
[20:28] like a low value lead and we'll see that
[20:30] tag come through and we'll see what the
[20:31] emo looks like okay just filled out
[20:33] another Form response this one is for
[20:35] Michael Scott we've got um he's
[20:37] interested in basic package budget range
[20:39] under $2,000 he's flexible on his
[20:40] timeline and he's just exploring options
[20:42] so let's submit this one we'll see it
[20:44] come through right here in that Google
[20:46] form and there's no status or tag so
[20:49] nadn should be working right now in the
[20:51] background in order to automate this all
[20:53] right that workflow just finished up
[20:55] running first thing we'll look at is the
[20:56] email so as you can see we got this ABC
[20:59] Corp exploring a options with our basic
[21:00] package hello Michael thank you for
[21:02] reaching out to ABC Corp we are
[21:03] delighted to hear about your interest in
[21:05] our basic package I understand that
[21:06] you're currently just exploring options
[21:08] and looking to learn more about how AI
[21:09] can benefit your needs our basic package
[21:11] is a perfect start for individuals or
[21:13] businesses blah blah blah since your
[21:15] preferred contact time is in the evening
[21:17] I'd be more than happy to arrange a time
[21:18] that works for you to discuss your needs
[21:20] further we can cover any questions you
[21:22] might have and explore how we can align
[21:24] with your goals please let me know um
[21:27] War regards Pam customer service ABC
[21:29] Corp so that's awesome we'll hop into
[21:32] the form real quick as you can see now
[21:33] we got a status in a tag he was tagged
[21:35] as a low value lead and Michael Scott
[21:37] was contacted by email on October 31st
[21:40] 11:16 a.m. the team has been notified
[21:42] via slack hop into slack new low value
[21:45] lead alert um name Michael Scott basic
[21:48] package his budget is under $22,000 you
[21:50] can click on this link and it will pull
[21:51] up that form in case we want to see any
[21:53] more
[21:54] information um like if they wanted to
[21:56] maybe Reach Out personally on email and
[21:59] yeah so that is all working properly all
[22:01] right so this was a very simple use case
[22:03] of sort of capturing some sort of form
[22:06] from a lead magnet it's going to go
[22:08] through and it's going to email them
[22:10] update stuff notify your team but
[22:12] there's also definitely ways you could
[22:13] work off of this like you could have
[22:14] some sort of campaign off of here where
[22:16] you're monitoring This Thread and if
[22:17] there's no response you could reach back
[22:19] out again automatically you could have
[22:21] them update in a CRM and sort of like
[22:22] add action steps for your team um you
[22:24] know connect to other workflows in order
[22:26] to um just sort of expand on on this so
[22:28] you're automating you know even more of
[22:30] the lead nurturing and sort of
[22:32] personalized Outreach process than what
[22:34] goes right here but hopefully that this
[22:36] opened your eyes on you know the power
[22:38] of a single node it was able to take a
[22:40] massive prompt and assign out different
[22:41] tasks based on um the way we were able
[22:43] to prompt it and um it's just I guess
[22:46] super cool that you can also like add a
[22:47] weight step it feels very personalized
[22:50] and the fact that you can just have a
[22:51] form sitting there and stuff will still
[22:53] be happening in the background is super
[22:55] super beneficial and um I think it's
[22:57] super cool so if you guys made it all
[22:59] the way to the end thank you really
[23:00] appreciate you guys watching and I hope
[23:02] I can see and talk to you guys in the
[23:04] school community and yeah appreciate all
[23:07] the support and that's it for today
[23:09] thanks guys
