[00:00] in this step-by-step tutorial I'm going
[00:01] to be walking through how to build this
[00:02] workflow where we're going to be
[00:04] utilizing two different agents in order
[00:05] to get rid of some of the tedious and
[00:07] time-consuming stuff that comes along
[00:08] with onboarding a new client by the end
[00:10] of this video you'll have this workflow
[00:12] up and running and you can do so with
[00:14] using absolutely zero code so let's not
[00:16] waste any more time let's just hop
[00:17] straight into this video okay so this
[00:19] workflow is going to be taking client
[00:21] information as we're onboarding them and
[00:23] it's going to do two things the first
[00:24] one is that it's going to automatically
[00:26] send them a email that's a kind of like
[00:28] a warm welcoming message welcoming them
[00:30] to the partnership that sort of thing
[00:32] and then the second one is that it's
[00:33] going to take their client profile give
[00:35] a nice summary and put it into a
[00:37] spreadsheet for us automatically so we
[00:38] can see all of our new clients in one
[00:40] Consolidated place so with that being
[00:43] said the first step that we're going to
[00:45] do here is going to be an nadn form
[00:47] trigger so the idea is that you would as
[00:50] you're onboarding a client you would say
[00:51] hey can you fill out this form real
[00:52] quick they'll fill out this information
[00:54] and then after they submit the form all
[00:56] of this other stuff will just happen
[00:57] automatically So within this s in form
[01:00] trigger node we can see we've got the
[01:02] URL that's what you're going to be able
[01:04] to send to the client in order for them
[01:05] to fill it out we can leave the
[01:07] authentication at none and then for the
[01:09] form path we don't really have to change
[01:10] this but I'm just going to call it demo
[01:11] for this video and as you can see it
[01:13] made the URL up here a lot shorter a lot
[01:15] easier to look at and then we need to
[01:17] just configure the form itself so the
[01:19] title we'll just go with client
[01:22] onboarding for the description we will
[01:24] say um please fill out the required
[01:29] fields
[01:31] and then we have our labels to set up so
[01:34] for this first one we'll just say like
[01:36] name we want their full name obviously
[01:38] and then the placeholder we can say your
[01:39] name and we want to make this a required
[01:41] field because if they don't fill it out
[01:43] then that kind of stinks because we
[01:44] don't know their name so I'm going to
[01:46] fill out a few more Fields here and then
[01:48] I'll be back in a sec Okay so we've got
[01:50] the fields filled out we've got name
[01:52] with the placeholder of your name that's
[01:54] just going to be kind of like a grade
[01:55] out area while they'll see an example of
[01:57] what they should fill out you'll see in
[01:59] a sec when we look at the form
[02:00] email your email company industry
[02:04] example finance and then what are you
[02:06] hoping to achieve through our
[02:07] partnership in the next 3 months and you
[02:09] can see all four of those are required
[02:10] fields and then at the end I just threw
[02:12] in anything else we should know and it's
[02:13] not required um you know the more
[02:15] information the better but they don't
[02:16] have to fill that out and then we want
[02:18] to respond when form is submitted that's
[02:20] when the workflow will trigger and then
[02:22] at the end I just like to click on
[02:23] options add option append NAD n
[02:26] attribution and then just turn that off
[02:28] it just makes the form look a little
[02:29] cleaner
[02:30] so that should be it for this node if we
[02:33] hit test step it'll pull up an example
[02:34] form for us and as you can see we've got
[02:36] the four required Fields here with their
[02:38] placeholders and then we have the last
[02:40] one at the bottom so I'll fill this out
[02:42] real quick so we can get some data to
[02:44] run through this as an example okay so
[02:46] here's the information I'm going with
[02:47] we've got my name one of my emails
[02:50] Finance is the
[02:51] industry um he wants to increase Revenue
[02:53] by 27% and then he doesn't want to be
[02:56] contacted after 600 p.m. or on weekends
[02:59] so we'll sub submit this form and
[03:01] response has been recorded we can see
[03:03] over here this is the information that
[03:04] came through this node into the form so
[03:06] we've got the name email industry all
[03:08] the information and then we've also got
[03:10] submitted at and the form mode so this
[03:12] is the information that's going to come
[03:13] through every time a new client fills
[03:15] out the form so we're just going to pin
[03:18] this data if you click on this pin up
[03:19] here the data is pinned so that just
[03:21] means that as we're testing every other
[03:23] node in this workflow this will be the
[03:24] example data that we'll be parsing
[03:26] through each node so that just helps a
[03:28] lot with you know troubleshooting and
[03:29] all that kind of
[03:31] stuff so next we're going to add our
[03:33] first AI agent so we can do this by
[03:35] clicking on the plus typing in AI agent
[03:37] and we can click right here so this guy
[03:40] is going to be the one that is making
[03:41] that warm welcome message for the client
[03:44] so we need to distinguish what type of
[03:46] agent this is going to be we've got
[03:48] tools conversational open Ai and three
[03:50] more we're going to do conversational
[03:52] because we're not actually giving this
[03:53] agent access to tools we're just having
[03:55] it take data from the form over here and
[03:57] then outputting um email for us so we're
[04:00] going to click on
[04:01] conversational we also want to prompt it
[04:04] not from the node previously we want to
[04:07] prompt it with something that we Define
[04:08] so we'll click on that and I'm going to
[04:10] type in this prompt real quick and I'll
[04:11] be back in a sec Okay so we've got our
[04:13] prompt here this side is what I typed in
[04:17] and then the right is the result so as
[04:19] you can see the green is the only stuff
[04:20] that changes these green variables with
[04:22] the double curly brackets just mean that
[04:24] it's a j a JavaScript variable um and
[04:27] that just means that we're pulling in
[04:28] this information from over here here so
[04:30] that this stuff will change every time
[04:32] there's a new client so I said can you
[04:34] please create a warm email warm welcome
[04:36] email for a new client based on their
[04:38] information we want the email to be
[04:39] concise and friendly but also
[04:40] professional it should be personalized
[04:42] to them based on their industry and what
[04:44] they're hoping to get out of our
[04:45] partnership and then we gave it
[04:46] information about the client so the name
[04:48] Nate herk email Nate herk 88 gmail.com
[04:52] industry what they're hoping to achieve
[04:54] and that's the information that it's
[04:55] going to be using to write the email so
[04:58] then at the bottom we said make sure to
[04:59] always sign off the email from Bob Bob
[05:01] this is where you put your name the
[05:03] company and the position so you can
[05:05] clarify that stuff because otherwise
[05:07] it's going to throw in variables like
[05:09] this so I said don't throw in variables
[05:10] for the sign off if information is
[05:12] unknown we don't ever want your name or
[05:15] your contact information in the email
[05:17] because that would look super
[05:18] unprofessional if you know clients are
[05:21] getting an email where there's like a
[05:22] variable that clearly wasn't filled in
[05:24] so we want to make sure that that does
[05:25] not happen and then finally we want the
[05:28] information output into three different
[05:30] fields we want the subject for the email
[05:32] subject the body for the email's body
[05:33] and then the email which will be
[05:35] variable based on what they enter in the
[05:37] form so actually we didn't need this
[05:38] part up here I can just delete that cuz
[05:40] that's repetitive so we've got this um
[05:43] so now let's test the step and see what
[05:45] we're working
[05:47] with okay as always you need to connect
[05:51] the chat model to the agent you need to
[05:52] give it a brain so let's do that
[05:54] otherwise it's not going to work so open
[05:56] AI we're going to select our credential
[05:58] if you don't know how to set it up you
[05:59] just got to go to open AI grab an API
[06:01] key super easy and then copy it into
[06:03] here and then I'm going to grab
[06:05] 40 um I'm grabbing 40 for this this
[06:08] guy's brain because 40 is kind of like
[06:11] the most consistent that I found at
[06:13] least and we're asking it to you know
[06:14] take information and make an email so I
[06:16] want the best model rather than if I was
[06:18] just you know parsing information or
[06:20] labeling I would maybe use a 35 or a 40
[06:23] min because it's a little more cost
[06:25] effective and they don't need to be as
[06:27] powerful so that's why I'm using 40 here
[06:29] so now we should be able to test this
[06:31] agent and see what it is giving us as an
[06:34] email so on the right hand side let me
[06:37] go
[06:37] to table mode no we'll just stay in
[06:40] we'll stay in Json okay so here's the
[06:42] information we've got um we've got the
[06:44] subject welcome to ABC Corp Nate the
[06:46] body dear Nate herk I hope this message
[06:48] finds you well on behalf of ABC Corp I'm
[06:50] excited to welcome you as a new client
[06:52] blah blah blah as you can see it's
[06:53] pretty personalized we've got you know
[06:55] increasing Revenue by 217% so it seems
[06:58] like a human actually wrote this and
[06:59] then at the bottom we've got warm
[07:01] regards Bob Bob internal relations ABC
[07:03] corpse so there's no you know square
[07:05] bracket variables so that looks good to
[07:07] go and I think we're ready to move on to
[07:09] the next note here so the next thing
[07:12] that we want to do is we want to get
[07:13] those three different parameters you
[07:15] know subject body and the email we want
[07:18] to get that actually into three
[07:19] different parameters so I'm going to add
[07:21] a open AI node we're going to grab this
[07:24] open AI node and we're going to do a
[07:26] text action of message a model so we'll
[07:28] grabb this same thing you need to set up
[07:30] your your API key in order to be able to
[07:32] access um open AI but this time we won't
[07:35] use 40 like I just said we want to oh
[07:37] we'll keep it this message model sorry
[07:39] for the model though we're not going to
[07:40] use foral we're going to use I'm going
[07:41] to use foral mini um and just like I
[07:45] said because we're just going to be
[07:46] parsing information here rather than you
[07:48] know generating information so I'm going
[07:51] to quickly write the system prompt and
[07:53] then I will be back okay so that didn't
[07:56] take long I wrote parse the Json query
[07:58] which is going to be this out put over
[07:59] here from the AI agent and output the
[08:02] parameter separately so then I just
[08:03] outlined what the parameters are just in
[08:05] case more consistent we got subject body
[08:07] and email and then make sure that's a
[08:08] system prompt because we're telling this
[08:10] open AI node how to act so that's a
[08:12] system prompt and then for the second
[08:14] message we'll leave it as user and we
[08:16] actually have to give it this
[08:17] information to parse so we'll just drag
[08:19] in the output string from over here we
[08:22] can see the subject body and the email
[08:24] that we have and we
[08:27] can test the St step so before you test
[08:30] it make sure you turn on output content
[08:32] as Json that just makes it you know it
[08:34] actually separates it into the three
[08:35] Fields so we've got it separated with
[08:37] the subject the body of the email and
[08:39] then the email that we're going to be
[08:40] sending it to so this information looks
[08:42] good looks like it passed through this
[08:44] node correctly now let's move on to the
[08:46] next step so the next thing we want to
[08:47] do here is we want to actually add the
[08:49] Gmail node that we'll be using to send
[08:51] the the email so we'll click on the plus
[08:54] we'll type in Gmail and as you can see
[08:56] 25 different actions but all we want to
[08:58] do here is we want to send send a
[09:00] message so you'll have to connect your
[09:02] Gmail account um once you do that we've
[09:04] got you know the resource is going to be
[09:06] a message we're going to be sending a
[09:08] message here is where it the magic
[09:10] happens so for two we're going to grab
[09:12] email you know that's who we're sending
[09:14] it to based on what they filled out in
[09:16] the form the subject we'll be grabbing
[09:18] the subject from that previous node and
[09:22] email type I'm going to make that a text
[09:24] and then for the actual message we will
[09:26] grab
[09:27] body so we've got the email conf
[09:29] configured and then for options we want
[09:31] to go in here do the same thing append
[09:33] NN attribution and then turn that off
[09:35] just doesn't add that little message at
[09:37] the bottom that says that this email was
[09:38] generated by nadn or sent by nadn so
[09:41] we're going to go ahead and test the
[09:42] step
[09:43] here um the O client was deleted so that
[09:46] just means that I didn't actually set up
[09:48] this credential correctly so I'll do
[09:49] that real quick and I'll be right back
[09:51] okay got my account back and connected
[09:53] now let's try that again so we test the
[09:56] step we see that it went through it says
[09:58] that it was sent we'll go to my email
[10:00] and we can see we just got this email so
[10:02] from upit digital gmail.com dear Nate
[10:04] herk help us message finds you well on
[10:06] behalf of ABC Corp I'm excited to
[10:07] welcome you as a new client at ABC Corp
[10:09] we understand the goal of increasing
[10:10] Revenue by 217 we're committed to
[10:12] supporting you and achieving this
[10:13] ambitious Target our team is eager to
[10:15] provide the tools insights and
[10:16] strategies necessary to help your
[10:18] company succeed so obviously you could
[10:20] give you know the AI agent more
[10:21] information based on what exactly your
[10:24] company does and whatever else that the
[10:27] the client form is filling out but as
[10:29] you can see it's very professional once
[10:31] again welcome aboard warm regards and
[10:32] none of this is um a variable so all of
[10:35] this is you know Bob Bob VP of relations
[10:37] so that email sent off
[10:39] correctly and that is it for this first
[10:42] part of the workflow so like I said two
[10:44] agents this first one was doing its job
[10:46] of sending a nice automatic warm
[10:48] Outreach message so now second part of
[10:50] the workflow we want to automatically
[10:52] have a client profile summary put into a
[10:54] database of new clients so let's click
[10:57] on the plus button and we're going to
[10:58] add another AI agent
[11:01] so what's great here is that we already
[11:02] have this information coming in from the
[11:04] form so we're saving a little bit of
[11:05] time on this step here already but this
[11:07] is again going to be a conversational
[11:09] agent because we're not giving it access
[11:10] to any tools same step here we're not
[11:13] going to be taking from the previous
[11:14] node we are going to be defining below
[11:16] so I'm going to type in this prompt real
[11:17] quick and I'll be right back okay so I
[11:19] filled out a brief prompt here and I'm
[11:21] just going to drag in the information so
[11:23] take the client information provided and
[11:25] create a summary of their client profile
[11:26] here is a client's information so we're
[11:29] giv the name we are giving the company
[11:32] industry we are giving what they're
[11:34] hoping to achieve sort of similar to the
[11:35] email tool or the email agent earlier
[11:38] and then we want it to Output output the
[11:40] following parameters so once again we
[11:42] want the name to be output we want the
[11:44] email to be output sorry about that and
[11:46] then the summary is going to be output
[11:48] which is a summary of the client based
[11:49] on their information so unlike last time
[11:52] I'm going to hook up the Brain before we
[11:54] try to test it we're going to grab an
[11:56] open AI chat model and and once again
[11:59] same exact reasoning as last time we're
[12:01] we're sort of making a summary so I want
[12:03] to use
[12:04] 40 and then we're going to delete this
[12:06] trigger because we've got the actual
[12:07] trigger of the form
[12:09] submission so let's test out this agent
[12:14] here okay so we've got the name Nate
[12:17] herk email that's nice and then we've
[12:19] got the summary Nate herk is from the
[12:21] finance industry and their goal is to
[12:22] increase Revenue by 217% so obviously in
[12:25] this case like you really could see that
[12:26] easily based on the form but if clients
[12:29] are in here and you've got you know a
[12:30] ton of different fields for them to fill
[12:31] out and they're you know typing a
[12:33] paragraph within their what they're
[12:34] hoping to achieve they give you very
[12:35] detailed this will give you a nice
[12:37] summary and it's automatically going to
[12:38] push into a database for you so next up
[12:41] again same thing as up here very similar
[12:43] workflow we're going to grab an open AI
[12:45] node and we're going to need to parse
[12:46] the information so we're going to grab a
[12:48] text actions message a
[12:50] model set up our credentials exact same
[12:53] reasoning here why I'm not going to use
[12:55] 40 I'm going to use 40 mini because
[12:57] we're just sort of parsing information
[13:00] and let me write this system prompt real
[13:02] quick and I'll be back you guys should
[13:04] have the hang in this by now this is a
[13:05] very similar workflow to that first
[13:07] agent that we built but we said parse
[13:09] the Json query into three separate
[13:10] Fields name email summary pretty simple
[13:13] that's a system prompt the next message
[13:15] is going to be user prompt we're just
[13:16] dragging in the actual information from
[13:18] that previous agent as you can see we've
[13:20] got the Json output there and it is
[13:23] going to parse this information for us
[13:24] as long as we click output content as
[13:26] Json so let's test this step St here and
[13:30] as you can see we've got three separate
[13:33] Fields name email and summary that we'll
[13:34] be able to drag into the next node okay
[13:37] so now we're going to connect a Google
[13:39] Sheets node this is going to be the
[13:42] database that I'm going to be using in
[13:44] this case for our new clients so we've
[13:47] already got the spreadsheet here this is
[13:48] the one I just called it new clients um
[13:51] I've got three columns name AML summary
[13:53] and that's where we're going to populate
[13:54] this information into so let's go back
[13:56] to NN we don't need to create a sheet we
[13:58] just need to a pend Row in sheet so
[14:01] we'll grab that we'll hook up our
[14:03] credentials and we're going to do a
[14:05] sheet within a document and a pend a
[14:08] row so we we've got the doc called new
[14:11] clients and there's only one sheet in
[14:12] there so we'll grab the sheet sheet one
[14:15] and now we need to map our columns so
[14:18] this is basically saying you know these
[14:19] are the columns that we have in um
[14:22] sheets and I know it looks a little
[14:23] confusing because they're Nam the exact
[14:24] same but in sheets we have The Columns
[14:26] of name email and summary and it's
[14:28] asking us what do we want to put into
[14:30] each column so it's pretty easy enough
[14:33] here we've got name we want to put the
[14:34] client's
[14:35] name we've got email we want to put the
[14:38] client's email and then finally we've
[14:40] got the summary about what the client's
[14:42] profile is like and we'll put that
[14:43] summary into there so we should be good
[14:46] here I'll click test step and I will
[14:49] click on Google sheet and we will see
[14:50] that this information should populate
[14:53] right in here so perfect Nate herk we
[14:55] got the email and then we've got the
[14:56] summary about this um new client
[14:59] so as you can see if you were just
[15:01] checking this sheet you could sort of
[15:02] see you know your new clients come in
[15:04] and you could get quick summaries about
[15:06] you know what what their profile is like
[15:07] so that you can assign them the right
[15:08] help but that's just sort of how this
[15:10] step is working yeah so at this point
[15:12] you could you know get a little more um
[15:15] complicated from here if you wanted to
[15:16] link these up to you know a WhatsApp
[15:18] node or a Discord node you could link it
[15:20] even to an email that sents back sends
[15:22] back to you any way that you want to you
[15:24] know notify yourself that the welcome
[15:28] message has been sent or they've been
[15:29] updated in the database that's what you
[15:30] could do but for now that's I just
[15:32] wanted to keep this video very simple
[15:34] it's three nodes per task and we have
[15:37] two agents within the same workflow of
[15:38] every time this form is being triggered
[15:40] so let's give this a save and let's
[15:42] actually test this out again so I went
[15:44] into our NAD form trigger node and I
[15:47] unpinned the data because we had that
[15:48] pinned to test now we are going to test
[15:51] the workflow based on this actual
[15:54] information and so this form will pop up
[15:56] and we will fill in information here so
[15:58] let's go with something else let's go
[15:59] with um John Bob I don't know why I keep
[16:04] using Bob um the email I'm just going to
[16:06] use that same one because we want to be
[16:08] able to see if it worked and then let's
[16:10] go
[16:11] industry let's do something like um
[16:15] technology and then let me write a ton
[16:18] of information in these two Fields so
[16:19] you guys can see how they come out okay
[16:22] so I filled in this information and I
[16:24] wrote I have a background in sales I
[16:25] enjoy spending time outside I like to
[16:27] talk on the phone rather than text I'm
[16:29] going to submit this but I realized that
[16:30] I forgot to add this variable into our
[16:32] agent that pushes the data into our
[16:34] Google sheet so we'll test this and then
[16:37] we will um update that that node and
[16:39] then we'll come test it again so let's
[16:41] just see what happens so we submit the
[16:43] form it's going to go through this
[16:44] workflow first talk to this agent it
[16:46] just made the message now it's parsing
[16:48] the message and after that's done it's
[16:50] going to send the email now we're going
[16:52] down to this agent it just got the
[16:54] summary parsed the summary and it should
[16:57] throw that into our sheets so let's
[16:59] first go to my email we should see
