[00:00] Today, I'm super excited to share with
[00:01] you guys the ultimate media agent. Not
[00:03] only does this agent have access to
[00:05] personal assistant functions like email,
[00:06] Google Drive, and calendar, but can also
[00:08] do so much on the creative side of
[00:10] things like creating an image, editing
[00:11] an image, creating a video, or turning
[00:13] an image into video. And then finally,
[00:15] it can post any of the media that you
[00:16] create on X, Tik Tok, or Instagram. And
[00:19] finally, something that's really
[00:20] important, it logs everything it does,
[00:22] even if there are errors, so that you
[00:24] can have full visibility into what your
[00:26] media agent is doing. As always, I'm
[00:27] going to give you guys this entire
[00:28] system for free so that you can get
[00:30] hooked up and start using this thing
[00:31] just like I am. So, stick around to the
[00:33] end of the video and I'll show you how
[00:34] to set everything up. So, I don't want
[00:35] to waste any time. Let's start seeing
[00:37] how this thing works. Okay, so we talked
[00:39] to our agent through Telegram and on
[00:40] this lefth hand side, you can see I'm
[00:41] going to send over an image. And what
[00:43] the agent's going to do is first of all
[00:44] process this into our Google Drive
[00:46] environment and then it's going to come
[00:47] back and say, "Hey, what do you want to
[00:48] call this file?" That way, we can keep
[00:50] it in your database for later. And while
[00:52] we're letting this spin, I'll just show
[00:53] you a quick sneak peek of something that
[00:54] it did earlier for me. this exact team
[00:56] of agents. So, here you can see the
[00:58] agent's pretty eager to help us out.
[01:00] It's asking us about how we want to name
[01:01] this and also if we want to change any
[01:03] sharing settings for this picture. So,
[01:06] right now we're not going to touch the
[01:07] sharing settings. I'm just going to give
[01:08] it a name. So, here you can see I just
[01:09] sent off this message that says to just
[01:11] name it speaker. What it's going to do
[01:12] is it's going to go to our Google Drive
[01:14] agent right here and that is the one
[01:16] that has the right tools to actually
[01:17] change the name. As you can see, this
[01:19] tool right here is called change name.
[01:20] So, we'll watch it hit the Google Drive
[01:22] agent and then we'll go check in our
[01:24] actual Google Drive folder to see if it
[01:26] has been changed. Okay, so it just
[01:28] responded to us and of course it's
[01:29] logging all of its actions which I'll
[01:30] show you guys later. But if I pull back
[01:32] up Telegram, it says that it renamed the
[01:34] file to speaker. I can click on this
[01:35] link right here and we should see that
[01:37] exact picture that I just uploaded. And
[01:39] you can see it exists in our folder
[01:40] called media. It is called speaker and
[01:42] it's right here. So now what I'm going
[01:43] to do is send off this other message
[01:45] that says please edit that image. Turn
[01:47] it into a studio looking image. It
[01:49] should be energetic, colorful, and
[01:50] highlight the feeling of listening to
[01:52] music on a speaker, whatever that means.
[01:54] The media team will figure it out. So,
[01:56] what this agent is going to do is it's
[01:57] using GPT5 Mini, which is its brain, to
[01:59] figure out which agents do I actually
[02:01] want to use in order to edit that image
[02:03] and turn it into a studio looking sort
[02:05] of advertisement. And so, what it's
[02:07] going to do is it's going to hit its
[02:08] creative agent right here. And this is
[02:10] the one that has access to that tool
[02:12] called edit image. And we should see it
[02:13] basically be able to grab that file from
[02:15] our Google Drive and edit it. It's also
[02:18] using a think tool because it has so
[02:19] many different actions to process that
[02:21] sometimes it needs to think. And if you
[02:22] haven't seen what this tool does, I'll
[02:23] link a video right up here where I cover
[02:25] that. As you can see, just as we
[02:26] predicted, the creative agent is using
[02:28] its edit image tool. So, I'll check back
[02:30] in with you guys once we get that final
[02:32] product back. All right, look at that.
[02:34] The agent actually ended up creating
[02:35] three different images for us. So, we
[02:37] have a couple different styles that we
[02:38] can choose from, which is pretty cool.
[02:39] So, now that it logged its actions, it
[02:41] said, "I created preview edits and saved
[02:43] them to Drive, but they're 1024 x 1024
[02:45] proofs. confirm before I render final
[02:47] 2048 deliverables. That's fine. So, as
[02:49] you guys saw, it sent us three different
[02:50] ones. As you can see, they're pretty
[02:52] much all named the same thing, just
[02:53] speaker studio vibrant. So, then it asks
[02:55] us what we want to do next. First thing
[02:57] I'm going to do is just go to our media
[02:58] folder and make sure they're there. So,
[02:59] we have the original source file, and
[03:01] then we have the three edited ones right
[03:03] here. So, here's number one. Here's
[03:04] number two. Here's number three. I think
[03:06] honestly number one is probably my
[03:08] favorite. So, this is the one that we're
[03:09] going to use to turn it into a video.
[03:11] All right. So, it just fired off this
[03:12] new message where I said, "Actually,
[03:14] what I want you to do is take that first
[03:15] preview file." So, this was the one that
[03:17] we liked the best. And then I said,
[03:19] "Turn that into a video. Create a VFX ad
[03:22] with music and lights that sync to the
[03:24] beat as an advertisement for a JBL
[03:26] speaker." So, once again, this is going
[03:27] to hit the creative agent. It's going to
[03:29] use that imagetovideo tool. And let me
[03:31] check back in with you guys once that
[03:33] has been processed. And of course, real
[03:34] quick, we're using GPT1 for the image
[03:37] generation, and we're using V3 fast for
[03:39] the video generation. Real quick, wanted
[03:41] to update you guys. The creative agent
[03:43] has full autonomy to use its tools to
[03:44] help us out with our media. And you can
[03:46] see it's going to turn that image into a
[03:48] video, but it also wanted to try out
[03:49] creating its own video with just text.
[03:51] So, I'm not too confident how good this
[03:53] one will be, but we'll definitely take a
[03:55] look. All right, so that just finished
[03:57] up. I'm very, very impressed. So, this
[03:59] first one is the one that was actually
[04:01] the image turned into video. So, let's
[04:03] click into this real quick. We'll hear
[04:04] the audio.
[04:12] That one's super cool. Very impressed.
[04:14] And now this one is just text to video.
[04:18] [Music]
[04:24] So obviously in that one we don't get
[04:26] the same like JBL branding or the actual
[04:28] speaker, but still could be some really
[04:30] good B-roll. And both of these were
[04:31] generated with V3 fast, which is cheaper
[04:34] and faster than V3. So imagine if we had
[04:36] these results in V3. Also, you can
[04:38] customize these prompts a lot more for
[04:39] your use case. You guys will see how I
[04:41] did it here and it's very very minimal.
[04:43] So very impressive. And then basically
[04:44] it responds to us and says, "Okay, here
[04:46] are the two different files we just
[04:47] made. What do you want to do next?" All
[04:49] right. So I'm going to shoot off this
[04:50] one. I'm saying to send the JBL speaker
[04:52] VFX video to Dexter Morgan. So what it's
[04:55] going to have to do is find in our
[04:56] Google Drive the right file that we're
[04:57] talking about. It's going to have to go
[04:58] to our contact agent to find Dexter
[05:00] Morgan's email and then figure out if it
[05:02] can send it to him over email. It also
[05:04] may have to go make the file sharable.
[05:06] So, it's got two options. It can share
[05:07] with what specific email or it can just
[05:10] share and make everyone a viewer of that
[05:12] file. So, we'll see what it does. Okay,
[05:15] cool. So, it got Dexter Morgan's email.
[05:16] It's searching through media right now.
[05:18] I'm assuming it's going to go back and
[05:19] either make it sharable if it's not
[05:21] already. And then, okay, there we go.
[05:23] It's sharing the file right now. And now
[05:24] it should kick off the actual email. All
[05:26] right, sweet. So, that just finished up.
[05:28] It said done. I found his contact
[05:30] information. Set the video to anyone
[05:32] with the link and sent the email. So, it
[05:33] signed off best your name and
[05:35] placeholders, which I don't like, but
[05:36] that was my fault for not prompting it
[05:37] that way. But either way, I'm just going
[05:39] to hop into the email and let's take a
[05:40] look. All right, so here's the email.
[05:41] I'm sure you guys are glad that Dexter
[05:42] Morgan made another return.
[05:44] Dextermiami.com.
[05:45] Although, if you've been watching the
[05:46] newer seasons, it's now dexterl.com.
[05:50] And then, who knows? But either way,
[05:52] please find the 15C VFX ad draft for the
[05:54] JBL speaker here. I don't think it's 15
[05:56] seconds, but either way, if we click on
[05:57] this link, it should now just pop up as
[05:59] our video file, which isn't fully
[06:01] processed yet, so we'd have to download
[06:03] it. Let me do that real quick. And when
[06:04] I hit download, this thing pops up. And
[06:06] that's the exact ad that we wanted to
[06:08] send. So, it was able to find the right
[06:09] one. And man, I just love how like the
[06:11] blue and red, they come out with music
[06:13] beats and it's like syncing to the
[06:14] audio. So cool. Okay, so let's give the
[06:17] other agents some love. We haven't used
[06:19] the social media one or the posting one
[06:21] or the create doc tool. So, what I'm
[06:22] going to do is kick off this message
[06:24] that says, "Find me two high-erforming
[06:26] videos about NAND on each of these
[06:28] platforms, Tik Tok, Instagram, and
[06:30] YouTube." So, it's going to go down here
[06:31] to the social media agent, and that's
[06:33] going to do all of the searching. And
[06:34] then we will basically tell it to
[06:36] compile those results into a doc, and
[06:39] then we'll come back later and have it
[06:41] post one of those ads on Tik Tok or
[06:43] something just to make sure that it's
[06:44] working. You can see it's doing search
[06:46] right now on all three of these
[06:47] simultaneously down here, YouTube,
[06:49] Instagram, and Tik Tok. These are all
[06:50] happening through Ampify, by the way,
[06:51] which I will show you guys like what's
[06:53] exactly going on. Don't forget to use
[06:54] the code down below if you want to get
[06:56] 30% off Ampify. Okay, workflow just
[06:58] finished up. It said, "Got it. I
[06:59] searched through these platforms and I
[07:01] found two high performing videos on
[07:02] each." So, for Tik Tok, we have these
[07:04] four editing workflows are the silent
[07:06] killers. We have the link to the video.
[07:07] We have the creator. We can see
[07:08] different statistics about it. Same
[07:10] thing with the second video. We'll come
[07:12] down here to YouTube. We can see you
[07:13] need to use niten right now. Free,
[07:16] local, private. That one's by network
[07:18] chuck. We've got a URL and then the
[07:20] second one is also about local setup.
[07:22] This one's also by Network Chuck and
[07:23] we've got a video right there. And then
[07:25] for Instagram, we have our URL, our
[07:27] creator, we have the caption, all this
[07:28] kind of information. So, we're able to
[07:30] actually search through based on, you
[07:32] know, a search term or a hashtag and we
[07:34] can specify how many videos we want from
[07:35] each platform. Then it said, "What do
[07:37] you want me to do next?" I'm just going
[07:38] to shoot this off, which says, "Put
[07:40] those insights into Google Doc." We've
[07:42] got a tool right over here. It didn't
[07:43] really make sense to throw this in with
[07:44] a different agent, so I just gave the
[07:46] main agent a tool to create a doc. and
[07:48] that goes to a separate end workflow
[07:50] that we built out and does that whole
[07:52] thing. Okay, cool. So, that one's
[07:54] finishing up right now. We should be
[07:55] receiving a link to the actual Google
[07:57] doc it just made. So, here it is. It
[07:58] called it niten high performing videos,
[08:00] Tik Tok, Instagram, YouTube. Here's the
[08:02] link. Let me click on that real quick.
[08:04] And it pulls up our Google doc right
[08:05] here where we can see it pretty much
[08:06] gave us those insights with a brief
[08:08] summary. And of course, it titled it as
[08:10] well. And it should have put this
[08:12] document in a folder in our drive called
[08:14] media analysis where you can see it
[08:16] popped up right here. Earlier I was
[08:18] testing this and I made a file called
[08:19] brainstorm and it just says don't forget
[08:21] to make your bed. All right, so I'm
[08:23] thinking you guys have probably seen the
[08:24] functionality of all these agents. You
[08:25] don't need to see calendar. You've seen
[08:27] that before. You don't need to see the
[08:28] web. You've seen that before. Let's just
[08:29] do a quick one with the posting agent.
[08:31] And what I'm going to do is tell it to
[08:32] just go grab that VFX of the JBL that we
[08:35] made and just post it to Tik Tok. All
[08:37] right. So I'm telling it to post that
[08:39] JBL VFX video ad on Tik Tok with the
[08:42] caption music to my ears. So it'll be
[08:43] interesting to see what it does here. It
[08:45] has memory. It has a five window context
[08:47] length, but we weren't most recently
[08:50] talking about this ad. You know, we were
[08:52] talking about some other stuff. So, it's
[08:53] going to have to probably search through
[08:55] the actual um media folder in order to
[08:58] pull back that ID of that file. And then
[09:00] once it has that ID, it can go ahead and
[09:02] hit the posting agent to make that post.
[09:04] So, as you can see, it looks like it's
[09:06] making sure the file is actually public
[09:07] because in order to post it using
[09:09] potato, the file's got to be public. So,
[09:11] it's doing that and then it's basically
[09:14] going to shoot it off over here and hit
[09:17] the Tik Tok post tool. All right, so it
[09:19] just said it posted the ad to Tik Tok.
[09:20] It gave us a submission ID and it
[09:22] captioned it music to my ears. Let me
[09:24] just hop over to Tik Tok real quick and
[09:25] make sure it's there. And as you can
[09:27] see, 1 minute ago, this just got posted
[09:28] and we have our ad.
[09:32] All right, so where to even begin? We've
[09:34] pretty much seen most of the agents here
[09:35] and I wanted to start actually breaking
[09:37] down how this kind of stuff works. So,
[09:39] I'll start with the two things up top,
[09:40] which is the input and the output. What
[09:42] happens over here is we're just doing a
[09:44] quick switch to see what type of input
[09:46] it is. So, if a photo exists, then we're
[09:48] going to go up to the photo path, and
[09:50] that's where we download it, put it to
[09:51] our drive, and then set the text. And if
[09:54] it's a regular text message that comes
[09:55] through, we're just going to feed it
[09:57] straight to the AI agent. And the reason
[09:58] why we have to set the text here is we
[10:00] have to make sure that both of the
[10:03] inputs equal message.ext text so that
[10:06] whichever way it comes, the agent will
[10:08] at least receive something from there.
[10:10] Obviously, it has its massive collection
[10:11] of agents and tools below it. But then
[10:13] what happens on this right side is it's
[10:15] going to clean up its intermediate steps
[10:17] and then log those in our tracker sheet
[10:19] and then send back a message to us in
[10:21] Telegram. And so what that tracker sheet
[10:22] looks like is right here we have this.
[10:25] We have timestamp, workflow, input,
[10:27] output, actions, tokens, and then total
[10:29] tokens. And let me just go all the way
[10:31] down to the bottom where our most recent
[10:32] runs would have been. Okay, so here's
[10:34] the most recent one where I said, "Post
[10:36] my JBL VFX video ad on TikTok with the
[10:38] caption." Here's what how it responded
[10:40] to us. And then we can see right here
[10:41] the actions that were taken. If we
[10:42] clicked into here, we could see the
[10:44] different tools it called and the
[10:45] different inputs and the stuff like
[10:46] that. And of course, we have our tokens.
[10:48] It shows us how many were prompt tokens,
[10:50] completion tokens, the total, and also
[10:52] which model was used for each of these
[10:54] little objects. And so, obviously, this
[10:56] is going to be really nice because you
[10:57] can see exactly what time different
[10:59] things were triggered. You can see
[11:00] inputs and outputs and you can see you
[11:03] know based on these patterns of actions
[11:04] that are happening and you know stuff
[11:05] like tokens you can make adjustments
[11:07] from there. And if you're confused about
[11:09] how you actually get there in your agent
[11:10] you have a setting down at the bottom or
[11:12] an option where you can return
[11:13] intermediate steps. And if you turn that
[11:15] on that's how you get this extra output
[11:17] on the right hand side of your agent
[11:19] right here where you have this big array
[11:20] of intermediate steps which has all of
[11:22] the actions and it has stuff like that.
[11:24] And the reason that we have both a
[11:26] success branch and an error branch is
[11:27] because we go to the agent settings and
[11:29] we want it to continue using an error
[11:31] output on error. If we didn't have it
[11:33] like this, basically that means if the
[11:35] agent failed for some reason, it would
[11:36] just stop the whole flow and we wouldn't
[11:38] get a log or notification or anything
[11:40] like that. So that's why we're able to
[11:41] split it up into two different branches.
[11:43] So real quick before I show you guys
[11:45] some of these tools and how these sub
[11:46] agents work, I thought real quick we'
[11:48] just actually read the system prompts
[11:49] for the main AI agent. So the overview
[11:51] is that you are the ultimate manager
[11:53] agent. Your job is to help the user out
[11:54] with the task by using your tools to
[11:56] delegate the task to their correct tool.
[11:58] You yourself should not be writing
[12:00] emails or creating summaries. Your sole
[12:02] responsibility is just to call the
[12:03] correct tool. It's got a ton of tools,
[12:05] right? It's got the Google Drive agent.
[12:06] It's got the email agent, calendar,
[12:08] contact, social media, creative,
[12:10] posting, web agent, create doc tool, and
[12:13] then a think tool. These descriptions of
[12:15] these tools are very, very high level.
[12:17] And the reason they're so high level is
[12:18] because in each of the sub aents or the
[12:20] sub tools, there's another description
[12:22] there where it's a little more detailed
[12:23] on when to use this tool. It's good to
[12:25] send as much information in the
[12:26] description over to the sub tool or sub
[12:28] agent because otherwise every single
[12:30] time your agent's processing all of
[12:32] this. So, if you make this really
[12:34] chunky, you're just going to be using
[12:35] more tokens. So, just something to think
[12:36] about. And then I have seven little key
[12:38] notes here that I decided to give it. I
[12:40] said, if the user submits a photo, ask
[12:41] them what to call the photo, then change
[12:43] the name. Some actions require you to
[12:44] look up contact information first, like
[12:46] these three. Images and videos are found
[12:48] in the database. Use the Google Drive
[12:50] agent to get to those. Before asking
[12:51] follow-up questions, use your Think Tool
[12:53] to figure out what to do next. And we've
[12:54] seen that it's been using the Think Tool
[12:56] a ton, which is awesome. Before posting
[12:58] anything, that file must be shared to
[12:59] anyone in Google Drive. When creating
[13:01] videos, don't ask how long they should
[13:02] be. You know, VO3 is basically just like
[13:04] 8 seconds every time. And then always
[13:06] output a message back to the user. Never
[13:08] say nothing. So, as you can see, that's
[13:09] not even too difficult or sophisticated
[13:11] of a system prompt. you'll receive an
[13:13] input, figure out which tools to use,
[13:15] and just use them. Couldn't be simpler.
[13:17] And then one other thing I will show you
[13:18] guys is that we're using GPT5 Mini
[13:21] through Open Router as the main model,
[13:23] but we also have a fallback model where
[13:25] we're using GPT5 Mini as well, but we're
[13:28] just doing it through OpenAI rather than
[13:30] Open Router. And maybe that's not the
[13:32] smartest because if OpenAI goes down,
[13:33] then both of these are screwed. But I
[13:35] could easily just switch this out to,
[13:37] you know, Anthropic or Google or
[13:38] something else. But if you didn't know
[13:40] about the fallback model, it's just a
[13:41] cool feature that they added in in the
[13:43] settings of the agent where you can
[13:44] enable a fallback model like I said. All
[13:46] right, so the first thing that I'm going
[13:48] to do is talk about these custom tools
[13:50] that I built. So we have the edit image,
[13:53] the create image, the image to video,
[13:54] and the create video. And then we have
[13:56] these three for posting. And then we
[13:58] have one for creating a doc. So like I
[14:00] said, these are all workflows that I
[14:01] built in edit and we're just having
[14:02] these sub aents call on those workflows.
[14:05] But they're all very simple. The reason
[14:06] why we're going through sub workflows is
[14:08] because we have to handle binary data.
[14:10] And sometimes binary data can be really
[14:12] annoying to work with sending between
[14:14] flows. So that's why you guys may have
[14:16] noticed that when the tools would finish
[14:17] up, we would get a response in Telegram
[14:19] before the main agent actually responded
[14:21] to us in Telegram. And it's just because
[14:22] I'm sending the binary in the subflows.
[14:25] So if you don't care about getting like
[14:26] super technical and you don't want to
[14:27] see what these tools are doing, then
[14:29] skip towards the end where I show you
[14:30] guys like what you need to know to set
[14:31] this stuff up. But I'm just going to
[14:33] talk about these subflows real quick. So
[14:34] let's just start with the create image
[14:36] tool. As you can see, the trigger has to
[14:38] be the when executed by another
[14:40] workflow. And what we do in here is we
[14:42] give specific inputs that we need. So in
[14:44] this case, we need the name that the
[14:46] image will be called. We need the image
[14:47] prompt. And we need the chat ID so that
[14:49] we can send all of the chats back to our
[14:52] Telegram. And we use the image name to
[14:54] name it in the drive. And we use the
[14:56] prompt here. So I'm not going to dive
[14:57] into all these flows and how I set up
[14:59] these requests, but essentially we're
[15:00] hitting OpenAI to create the image.
[15:02] We're turning that URL into a binary
[15:05] file and then sending it to ourselves as
[15:07] well as putting it in the Google Drive
[15:08] folder. And like I said, we have these
[15:10] inputs that we're sending over. And the
[15:12] way that we're able to specify how those
[15:13] work is in the tool. So that was the
[15:15] create image workflow. And if we click
[15:17] into this create image tool, you can see
[15:19] that it gives us these three things to
[15:21] send over. And I'm letting the AI model
[15:23] define what's the image name, what's the
[15:25] image prompt. But for the chat ID, we're
[15:28] referencing a variable. And I'm
[15:29] basically just able to grab this from
[15:31] the Telegram trigger node and pull over
[15:34] the chat ID that kicked off the original
[15:36] message. And that's really important to
[15:38] understand because we're doing that
[15:39] throughout all of these subtools. For
[15:41] edit image, what we're sending over is
[15:43] image name, image request, chat ID, and
[15:46] picture ID. And this is the edit image
[15:48] tool. It's basically identical to the
[15:50] create image tool except for we actually
[15:52] have to download that file. So we need
[15:54] the file ID of the original one that we
[15:56] want to edit because that lives in our
[15:57] Google Drive. And once we are able to
[15:59] pull that in, we can feed it into this
[16:01] edit image node, which is another node
[16:04] request to OpenAI's image generator. And
[16:06] now we're able to actually give it the
[16:07] original, give it the prompt, and it
[16:09] makes a new one. And then once again, it
[16:11] sends that new one to us in Telegram and
[16:13] also puts it in our Google Drive. Now,
[16:15] these two get a little more complicated,
[16:16] but not too bad. First, let's look at
[16:18] the create video. What we're telling it
[16:20] to send over is a video prompt, chat ID,
[16:23] video title, and an aspect ratio. And
[16:26] then the actual tool looks like this.
[16:28] It's going to capture all those
[16:29] variables, feed them into FAL AI, which
[16:32] is where we're accessing Google V3 fast.
[16:34] We set up a polling flow. So, it's going
[16:36] to continuously check in to make sure
[16:37] that the video is actually done. And
[16:39] once it finally is done, it's going to
[16:41] move on, download that file, and then
[16:42] send it to us in Telegram and also put
[16:44] it back in our media folder drive. And
[16:46] then the image tovide tool is basically
[16:48] identical to the create video tool
[16:50] except for we actually need that file ID
[16:52] to hand the original image to the video
[16:54] generation model. very similar to what
[16:56] we did earlier with the edit image tool.
[16:58] So you can see we pass over a file ID, a
[17:00] video prompt, a chat ID, and the name of
[17:03] the original image. And what that
[17:05] workflow looks like is this. It's very
[17:06] similar to that first one, except for we
[17:08] actually have to download the file
[17:10] first. So basically, we get the file ID,
[17:13] we share it, we download it, we get a
[17:15] URL for it, and then we pass that URL
[17:17] into FAL to create the video based on
[17:20] that original source file image. Same
[17:22] thing. We poll, we get it done, and then
[17:24] we send it to us in Telegram and we put
[17:26] it in our Google Drive. So, I know this
[17:27] may seem kind of intimidating, but
[17:29] hopefully you can understand the
[17:30] patterns here of all we're doing is
[17:32] we're passing over small variables
[17:34] between flows and the variables. Now, we
[17:36] have everything that we need to do in
[17:38] this workflow. This workflow in itself
[17:39] is not complicated. And I think if you
[17:41] guys, you know, download this workflow
[17:42] and you dive into it, you'll see it's
[17:43] not complicated. I think sometimes when
[17:46] you think about like having to pass
[17:47] stuff from agent to tool, that's where
[17:49] it gets a little intimidating. But
[17:51] hopefully now you can see that's a
[17:52] pretty simple agent setup. And it was
[17:54] pretty cool that it had like full
[17:55] autonomy to decide which of these tools
[17:57] should I actually use. While I was
[17:58] editing this video, I realized that I
[18:00] didn't touch on something in as much
[18:01] depth as I'd like to. So, real quick,
[18:03] just going to come in here and explain
[18:05] this. So, I pulled back in this
[18:06] execution where we had the creative
[18:08] agent use our image of that speaker to
[18:10] turn it into a video ad. And then it
[18:12] also created its own video. But what I
[18:14] wanted to show you guys is that if we go
[18:16] into this subexecution here, what you
[18:18] can see is that there's no AI step in
[18:20] here. We're basically feeding in our
[18:21] prompt and everything right from that
[18:24] main workflow that called on it. So all
[18:26] the magic of the prompting is happening
[18:28] right here. As you can see, we basically
[18:30] tell this main creative agent, this is
[18:32] its full system prompt instructions.
[18:36] Image prompts should be detailed and
[18:37] stylized. Video prompts should be
[18:39] concise, energetic, and should be one
[18:40] seamless video with no cuts. Explain the
[18:42] sounds in the video or any dialogue. And
[18:45] then up here, it's overview is that
[18:46] you're a creative agent. use your tools
[18:48] to take action as requested and that you
[18:50] are an expert AI image video prompt
[18:52] generator. So this creative agent
[18:54] receives the request from its main agent
[18:56] up here and it itself sends over these
[19:00] really you know high quality prompts for
[19:03] image to video and for video and then
[19:04] also the same thing with the images. And
[19:06] so the reason I wanted to bring this up
[19:07] is because this is GPT5 mini that's
[19:10] creating these prompts over here. As you
[19:11] can see, it's sending over this this
[19:13] full video prompt to the workflow. And
[19:17] when I was brainstorming about building
[19:18] this system, my idea was that I was
[19:20] going to go into this workflow. I was
[19:22] going to have the main one send over an
[19:24] initial small prompt and then I was
[19:26] going to use like a prompt AI agent in
[19:28] this flow that would be super super
[19:30] prompted on how to create like a
[19:32] structured JSON prompt. I'm sure you
[19:33] guys have seen like V3 JSON prompting
[19:36] all over X, LinkedIn, stuff like that.
[19:38] And so that's what I was going to do.
[19:40] And I started off doing that and then it
[19:41] just became like not very consistent and
[19:43] it it wasn't super super good and it
[19:46] also was like very specific to one use
[19:48] case and then I just basically gave the
[19:50] agent a little more autonomy and I was
[19:51] really happy with the output. So for now
[19:53] it's like this. I'm happy with it. But
[19:55] once again, if you had a very specific
[19:57] use case where you would need this media
[19:59] agent to make certain types of content,
[20:01] really easy to just basically move over
[20:04] this trigger, put an AI agent right
[20:06] here, and have the AI agent create a
[20:08] very specific prompt for you. You know,
[20:09] I think even if I go into the workflow
[20:11] history real quick, we can see that
[20:13] that's the route that I was taking
[20:14] initially earlier today. Yep, here it
[20:16] is. So, this is the latest saved and
[20:17] this was about 20 minutes before. You
[20:20] can see I had this prompt agent in here
[20:21] and I was giving it like structured JSON
[20:23] prompts to do. And like I said, I was
[20:25] just getting issues where it was like
[20:26] throwing in the reference image randomly
[20:28] and maybe I'm not the best at JSON
[20:29] prompting and I have some learning to do
[20:31] here, but it's kind of cool and I wanted
[20:32] to show you guys behind the scenes that
[20:34] I had tried this and I ended up taking
[20:36] it away and I was happier with those
[20:37] results. And I know that I'm not diving
[20:39] into all of these different prompts and
[20:40] all of these different agents. They're
[20:42] all pretty standard, but keep in mind
[20:43] when you download the template, you'll
[20:44] be able to look at all of this and just
[20:46] dissect whatever you want to. And then
[20:48] when it comes to these posting flows,
[20:50] these are all very, very identical.
[20:52] There's just one thing switched. And let
[20:54] me just pull up the X one to show you
[20:55] guys. It's super simple. What we're
[20:57] capturing over here is the file ID of
[20:59] course and then the text which will be
[21:01] like the caption of the post. And then
[21:03] with those two things, we basically
[21:04] upload the Google Drive file to Blot and
[21:07] then Blot post it to X. And so all of
[21:10] these are the same. We have X, we have
[21:13] Tik Tok, we have Instagram. The only
[21:14] thing that changed is within each of
[21:16] these nodes. We just change the platform
[21:18] that we're posting on. And so that's why
[21:19] I said when you get this template and
[21:21] you want to change like what you're
[21:22] posting to, it'd be super easy to just
[21:24] customize those tools for your liking.
[21:26] And then the final tool over here is
[21:27] creating a doc. What we're doing is
[21:29] we're sending over the title of the doc
[21:30] as well as the content of the doc. And
[21:32] if I click into this button to show you
[21:34] guys what this subworkflow looks like,
[21:35] you can see this one's very, very simple
[21:37] as well. We're capturing the title and
[21:38] the content. When we go to create the
[21:40] doc, we're basically just creating a
[21:42] document with a title. And then when we
[21:44] make that, it gives us a document ID.
[21:46] And we use that document ID right here
[21:47] to update it. And all we do then is we
[21:49] pass in the actual content. So it's a
[21:51] two-step thing. And then all I did here
[21:53] and then all I did on this side is I
[21:54] have a variable just to show the the doc
[21:56] ID so that we get our clickable link
[21:58] right away. Okay. Next, let me explain
[22:00] what's going on down here in the social
[22:02] media agent. So what we're doing here is
[22:04] we are doing three different requests to
[22:07] ampify. And ampify is kind of like a
[22:10] marketplace for different actors we can
[22:12] use. And actors is just a fancy word for
[22:14] like a scraper. So, what I did is the
[22:16] first one I wanted to do is I knew that
[22:17] I wanted to scrape YouTube. So, I went
[22:19] here and I grabbed this YouTube scraper
[22:21] and then I just set up this request. So,
[22:23] I'm not going to dive too deep into it,
[22:25] but what you're going to do is you're
[22:26] going to go to Apify, create an API
[22:27] token. You will then come up here to
[22:30] authentication and create a predefined
[22:32] credential type. You will go to Appify
[22:33] API and then just put in your API key.
[22:36] And this will already be completely
[22:37] configured for you where the AI is
[22:39] basically making this request to Amplify
[22:41] and it's saying, "Okay, here's how many
[22:42] results the user wants and here's the
[22:44] search term that he is looking for." And
[22:46] pretty much this exact same thing is
[22:48] happening within each of these two
[22:49] requests. The only difference is that
[22:51] they're all different actors. So, they
[22:53] accept data a little bit differently,
[22:54] but essentially it's the same thing of
[22:56] search term and how many, you know,
[22:58] posts do you want back. And this is
[22:59] where you can really feel free to switch
[23:01] out different scrapers that you may want
[23:03] to use and what exactly you're looking
[23:04] to do when you're using like a social
[23:06] media agent. But I just really wanted to
[23:08] show you guys how easy this can be to
[23:11] make these different systems of
[23:12] autonomous agents. Give them tools based
[23:14] on like things that kind of make sense,
[23:16] different buckets. And once again, I'm
[23:18] using GBT5 Mini here to power this
[23:20] entire thing. All right, to wrap this
[23:22] one up here, we're going to do a quick
[23:23] cost breakdown of everything that's
[23:25] associated with running the system. And
[23:26] then I'm also going to show you guys
[23:28] like what you need to do if you actually
[23:29] want to get this set up. So, first of
[23:31] all, if you do want to get this set up,
[23:32] you're going to go to my free school
[23:33] community. You can also access this full
[23:35] guide if you go there. The free school
[23:36] community is linked down in the
[23:38] description. And once you get here, you
[23:39] just need to search for the title of
[23:40] this video or it might be pinned or in
[23:42] the YouTube resources, but it will be
[23:44] here. And once you click on that post,
[23:46] you'll be able to download the JSON
[23:48] file. In this case, it'll probably be a
[23:49] zip file with like eight or nine total
[23:51] files, but you'll download those. and
[23:53] then I'll show you like the full setup
[23:55] guide of how to get going with this. So,
[23:57] first of all, we have the cost
[23:58] breakdown. Your first cost to be
[23:59] thinking about is your chat models, your
[24:02] token usage there. And so, today I was
[24:04] using a mix of GPT5 mini. So, pretty
[24:06] cool that the entire system, the main
[24:08] agent was running on 5 Mini. And then
[24:10] for some of these sub agents, I was
[24:11] using 4.1 just because I'd had them on
[24:14] 4.1 for so long and they worked so well.
[24:16] So, for this video, just didn't touch
[24:18] them. And you can actually see here that
[24:19] 5 minis cheaper on the input but more
[24:21] expensive on the output. So you can do
[24:23] the math and kind of even that out
[24:24] there. Then we have the pricing of the
[24:27] image generation and the video
[24:28] generation. So we were using GPT- image
[24:31] 1 for the image generation. And so this
[24:34] doesn't matter as much like in my mind
[24:36] at least. This is more about like the
[24:37] input tokens on the prompts. I think
[24:39] what people are more concerned about is
[24:40] per image pricing. So for lowquality
[24:43] square image it's going to be roughly a
[24:44] cent. For medium it's roughly 4 cents
[24:46] and for high roughly 17 cents. And I
[24:48] think in this case we were using the
[24:50] medium images for 5 cents a pop. And
[24:52] then we were using V3 fast to make
[24:54] videos. And the pricing is a little bit
[24:56] different if you're doing text to video
[24:57] or image to video. So for text to video,
[24:59] for every second you're going to be
[25:01] charged 25 cents, but we were doing
[25:03] audio on, so that would have been 40.
[25:04] And then for image to video, it's the
[25:06] same price for audio on per second, but
[25:09] if you don't do audio, it's going to be
[25:10] a little more expensive per second. But
[25:12] it also said that this is experimental
[25:14] pricing and could change. And then
[25:15] there's a couple subscriptions that you
[25:16] may want if you want to duplicate
[25:18] exactly what I have here. The first one
[25:20] would be Blotato, which the first plan
[25:21] is 29 bucks a month, but you can get 30%
[25:24] off for 6 months if you use code Nate30
[25:26] at checkout. And then you also have the
[25:27] Aify scrapers down here for different
[25:29] social medias. And Apify, you've got
[25:31] different tiers of pricing, but you can
[25:33] also use code 30 Nate Herk for 30% off
[25:35] your first 3 months at Appify. And then
[25:37] down here in the web agent, we had a few
[25:39] APIs as well. We had Perplexity, we had
[25:41] Tavly, we had Open Weather Map, and all
[25:43] of these are fairly costefficient. All
[25:45] right, so now moving on to part two, the
[25:47] setup instructions, because I'll be
[25:48] honest, this is not going to be like a
[25:50] super simple two-minute setup. You're
[25:52] just going to have to do a few things,
[25:53] but it's not going to be too bad. And
[25:54] also, if you hear jets in the
[25:55] background, they're like practicing for
[25:57] the air show. And um yeah, there's just
[25:59] a bunch of jets. It's getting super
[26:01] loud. But either way, let's talk about
[26:02] setup. So, when you go to my free school
[26:04] community and you click on the post,
[26:06] there's going to be a zip file right
[26:07] here. And the zip file will have nine
[26:09] different workflows. It's going to first
[26:10] of all have the four for the creative
[26:12] agent down here. So it's going to have
[26:13] edit image, create image, image to
[26:15] video, and create video. And then for
[26:17] the posting agent, it'll have these
[26:18] three X, Tik Tok, Instagram. And then
[26:20] you'll have the create doc tool, which
[26:22] will also be a workflow. And then you'll
[26:24] have this entire thing as its own
[26:25] workflow, too. So that's going to be
[26:27] nine total files to download and import
[26:29] into niten. But the rest of these agents
[26:31] will seamlessly integrate because
[26:32] they're already going to be baked into
[26:34] the main agent workflow. Luckily, we
[26:36] have this functionality. Otherwise, this
[26:38] would have been like 15 workflows to
[26:41] download. And so once you have all of
[26:42] those downloaded, what's going to be
[26:43] really important is that you download
[26:45] them into your NADN. You name them
[26:47] something and then once you name them,
[26:49] you're going to have to link them to
[26:50] each tool. So in this case, the edit
[26:52] image tool. I called it edit image tool
[26:54] and I sync them up. You can tell because
[26:57] if I click on it, it's going to pull up
[26:58] the actual tool itself. So that's a good
[27:01] test. Make sure that once you connect
[27:02] these, if you click on this button,
[27:04] it'll pull up that actual tool and the
[27:06] workflow that you just downloaded. So,
[27:07] like I said, you're going to have to do
[27:08] that for all of these down here that are
[27:10] custom tools. And then after that, the
[27:12] last thing you'll have to configure is
[27:13] your own Google environment. So, keep in
[27:15] mind what's happening is our creative
[27:18] agent is putting all of the videos and
[27:20] images in a folder in my Google Drive
[27:22] called media. So, if you just create a
[27:24] folder in Google Drive called media and
[27:26] you sync them up to those nodes, you'll
[27:27] be set. And then what's happening is
[27:29] once our agent creates a Google doc, it
[27:31] puts those in a Google Drive folder
[27:33] called media analysis. So, if you sync
[27:35] those things up and then you come in
[27:36] here and you make sure that like you
[27:38] know the search media tool links up to
[27:40] your folder called media and that the
[27:43] search docs tool over here links up to
[27:44] your folder called media analysis. And
[27:46] then the other piece is in the actual
[27:48] workflows that create something at the
[27:50] end. If you remember, we were uploading
[27:52] them back to our drive and this is where
[27:54] I chose the folder called media to put
[27:56] them in. But when we have our Google doc
[27:58] tool, which I think was this one, we can
[28:00] see that what it does is it just creates
[28:01] a doc. And this is where we actually
[28:03] choose to put it in the folder called
[28:05] media analysis. So like I said, a couple
[28:07] things you'll have to configure, but
[28:08] once you do, you're all set. And then
[28:10] finally, the last thing to do would be
[28:12] the actual Google Sheets. So we have two
[28:15] Google Sheets nodes up here, and that's
[28:16] what links up to this media agent
[28:18] logger. And I'm going to give you guys
[28:21] the copy of this template, and all the
[28:23] names will be set up. So all you'll have
[28:25] to do is come in here and just make sure
[28:27] that you're looking at the right
[28:28] document and the right sheet, and you
[28:30] should be set. So, I know there's a lot
[28:32] going on in this flow. Tried to do my
[28:33] best here to make that holistic. You
[28:35] guys will have access to this document.
[28:37] You'll have access to a little setup
[28:38] guide in here once you download this
[28:40] main flow. So, hopefully that's all you
[28:43] guys need to actually get this up and
[28:44] running. And if you're looking to take
[28:45] these skills further or you're really
[28:47] having trouble getting this thing set up
[28:48] and working, then definitely check out
[28:49] my plus community. The link for that's
