[00:00] What we're looking at today is the smart
[00:01] AI ré collection system that not only
[00:04] analyzes the candidate for strengths and
[00:05] weaknesses, but it will also look at the
[00:07] job description that they're applying
[00:08] for and it will tell you what's the risk
[00:10] here, what's the reward, what's the
[00:12] overall fit, and then it will give you
[00:13] some justification for it. This is going
[00:15] to be a huge timesaver for recruiters
[00:16] during the hiring process and it's also
[00:18] going to keep personal bias out of the
[00:20] equation. So, what I'm going to do today
[00:21] is build this right in front of you guys
[00:23] live. I'm going to tell you guys my
[00:25] thought process as I'm building it and
[00:26] by the end you'll have it all set up for
[00:28] yourself. Okay, so this is a very simple
[00:30] system and it's able to be customized to
[00:32] fit your needs. And what I'm going to do
[00:33] first before we start building is tell
[00:35] you guys about how I approach anything
[00:37] that I want to automate and how I think
[00:38] about it. So this is a really important
[00:40] mindset shift to get in the habit of
[00:41] which is basically listing out the steps
[00:44] that you would do manually if you wanted
[00:45] to complete this process. And when I
[00:47] start to list out the steps, I'll do
[00:48] that in like a Google doc or Google
[00:50] Sheets or something like that. And then
[00:51] I always come over to Excaligraw and I
[00:53] take that process map of the steps and I
[00:55] turn it into a wireframe. And the idea
[00:57] here is to understand what's the
[00:58] trigger, what are the different data
[01:00] sources, do we need to do any data
[01:02] transformation, where does AI come into
[01:04] play, and this will make it very clear
[01:06] kind of like what nodes we need to use,
[01:07] but also do I need to build an agent or
[01:09] can I just build a workflow? And in this
[01:11] case, we can see that there's a decision
[01:12] to be made right here, which is
[01:14] basically what type of file is the
[01:15] resume. But we can make this decision
[01:17] without using any AI. So we don't need
[01:19] an agent and we keep the workflow really
[01:21] simple. So let's real quick go through
[01:23] this wireframe and understand at a high
[01:24] level how the system works. And if you
[01:26] guys want to check out my full course on
[01:27] process mapping, wireframing, and then
[01:30] getting into edit end and automating the
[01:31] systems, then definitely check out my
[01:33] plus group. The link for that is down in
[01:34] the description. We've got two full
[01:36] courses in here right now. We have agent
[01:37] zero, which is the foundations of a
[01:39] automation, and then we have 10 hours to
[01:40] 10 seconds where you actually learn to
[01:42] pick the process, map the steps,
[01:44] wireframe it, and then you get into and
[01:46] start automating processes. We also just
[01:48] partnered up with over 500 tools and you
[01:50] can get up to $3 million in savings. So,
[01:52] if you're interested in that, check out
[01:53] the plus group. Okay, so when it comes
[01:55] to wireframing, it doesn't have to be
[01:56] perfect, but you want to have a general
[01:57] idea of what you're going to build so
[01:59] that you get into edit end and you can
[02:01] just build it. You're going to save
[02:02] yourself a lot of time. Imagine if you
[02:03] open up a Lego box for a tractor and you
[02:05] started trying to build the tractor
[02:06] without looking at the instruction
[02:08] manual. That's kind of what building an
[02:09] end without a wireframe is like.
[02:11] Anyways, let's zoom in over here and
[02:12] just go down this path. So, I knew that
[02:15] I needed some sort of trigger, which
[02:16] would be how do we actually get the
[02:18] resume into NAD? I decided to go with
[02:20] Gmail here, but you could obviously have
[02:21] this be a web hook if it's like a form
[02:23] submission, or you could have it be a
[02:24] new row in your Air Table, whatever you
[02:26] want. You can obviously switch that out.
[02:28] We're going with Gmail for simplicity.
[02:30] Then I basically thought about, okay, so
[02:31] I get this email. What do I want to do
[02:32] next? I want to download it and keep it
[02:34] somewhere. So I have a Google Drive
[02:36] folder that's called RS where we're
[02:38] going to store all the résumés. From
[02:39] there, what we need to do is we need to
[02:41] extract the text from the resume. And
[02:43] there's different ways that people may
[02:44] send it. It could be a Word doc, it
[02:45] could be a PDF, it could even be a text
[02:47] file. So these are the three examples
[02:48] we're going with here, but you could
[02:50] obviously customize that too. And
[02:52] depending on the type of file, there'll
[02:53] be different logic. So Word docs are the
[02:56] toughest. What we have to do is make an
[02:57] HTTP request to convert it to a Google
[03:00] doc so that we can then extract the text
[03:02] from it. If it's a PDF, we're going to
[03:03] go down this path and we'll just
[03:05] download it right away and then extract
[03:06] the text from it. And same thing with
[03:08] the text file. It's pretty easy. We'll
[03:10] just download it and extract the text.
[03:12] But ultimately the goal here is we just
[03:13] want to get that resume into text
[03:15] because it comes through as binary and
[03:17] if it doesn't make sense right now it
[03:18] completely will once we get into nen but
[03:20] just high level this is what we're doing
[03:22] and whenever we have data kind of
[03:24] branching off into different paths it
[03:26] has to get standardized in some form so
[03:29] that we can pass it down the rest of the
[03:30] flow and it will actually make sense.
[03:32] So, we're basically routing all of the
[03:34] extracted texts into one node, and we'll
[03:36] set it as a field called resume or text
[03:39] just so we can continue on and we'll be
[03:41] fine. We have the resume. What we want
[03:43] to do now is get the job description.
[03:44] So, I'll have a different Google Doc
[03:46] with the job description, you know, um
[03:48] requirements, criteria,
[03:50] responsibilities, that kind of stuff.
[03:51] We'll extract the text from the job
[03:52] description, and then we have our AI
[03:54] agent come into play where we can say,
[03:56] okay, here's the resume of the
[03:58] candidate. Here's the job description.
[04:00] analyze these both and give us the
[04:02] strength and weaknesses, the risk and
[04:03] reward, the overall fit of the candidate
[04:05] for this job description and then
[04:08] justify it. And then in our Google
[04:09] sheet, we also want to have their first
[04:11] name, last name, and email address. And
[04:12] then that's basically the end of the
[04:14] process is we go to Google sheet. Now,
[04:16] you could also end this off with like a
[04:17] notification to yourself in Slack or a
[04:19] new email. Whatever it is, we're ending
[04:21] it here. And so, I'm not saying that you
[04:22] can have AI just hire everybody, but you
[04:24] could definitely let the system run and
[04:26] then personally reach out to anyone that
[04:27] ranked high on the overall fit. or if
[04:29] you're having trouble deciding between
[04:30] two candidates, you could come in here
[04:32] and see what the AI thought from a very
[04:34] objective standpoint where maybe you had
[04:36] some implicit bias in there and you
[04:38] didn't realize it. So anyways, that is
[04:39] what the system does. That's our little
[04:41] wireframe. And now that we have that,
[04:43] let's get into edit and build the
[04:44] system. All right, so we know that the
[04:46] trigger of this workflow is going to be
[04:48] Gmail. So I'm going to type in Gmail.
[04:49] We're going to grab this guy and we're
[04:51] going to grab the trigger on message
[04:52] received. So what this is going to do is
[04:54] every minute it's going to check and if
[04:55] a new email hits this inbox, it's going
[04:57] to pull it in. And I just sent myself an
[04:59] email with a resume from a fake
[05:01] character named Jordan Reeves. And it is
[05:02] a Word doc. So I'm going to hit fetch
[05:04] test event. And what's going to happen
[05:05] is we see the email came in. You know,
[05:07] it says here is my resume. The subject
[05:09] is Jordan Reeves. But we don't see the
[05:12] actual resume. So what you want to do is
[05:13] turn off simplify. You want to add an
[05:15] option down here that says download
[05:17] attachments. And we check that on. And
[05:19] now if I run this again, we should see
[05:21] the binary image right here, which is
[05:23] Jordan Reeves resume as a Word doc. Now,
[05:26] you also have the option right here to
[05:27] change the prefix. So, right now it just
[05:29] comes through as attachment_0. You could
[05:31] add a prefix and make it say ré_0,
[05:34] whatever you want. I'm just going to
[05:35] keep it as the default for now. But we
[05:37] can see that we got our resume. And by
[05:39] the way, if you're having trouble with
[05:40] Google credentials, go ahead and check
[05:41] out this video that I'll tag right up
[05:43] here and then come back to this build.
[05:44] What's next according to our wireframe
[05:46] is to download the resume. So, I'm going
[05:48] to click on the plus and I'm going to
[05:50] grab a Google Drive node. And what we
[05:52] want to do is upload a file to our
[05:55] Google Drive. So we already have
[05:57] ourselves connected. I'm going to choose
[05:58] where to put it. So I have a folder in
[06:00] my drive called RSés, which I will
[06:02] choose right there. And now we have two
[06:04] things to set up. The first one is the
[06:06] input data field name. So this is
[06:08] basically the name of the input field
[06:10] containing the binary file that we want
[06:11] to upload to Google Drive. And right
[06:13] here you can see it's called
[06:14] attachment_0.
[06:16] So I'm just going to copy that and paste
[06:17] that in there. And now these two things
[06:19] are linked.
[06:21] The next thing is what is the file name
[06:23] in Google Drive? So, I'm going to change
[06:25] this to an expression and I'm just going
[06:26] to basically make it the person's name
[06:28] and then resume. So, I'm going to go to
[06:30] JSON. Let's basically just assume that
[06:32] we told applicants, you know, put your
[06:34] full name as the subject of the email.
[06:36] So, I could just grab subject right
[06:37] here. So, now it's coming through as
[06:39] Jordan Reeves and then I can just type
[06:40] in resume. So, that is how the file will
[06:43] go into our Google Drive. So, it looks
[06:44] like we're good to go. I'll hit execute
[06:46] step and we will watch this one send it
[06:48] off to our Google Drive. And what that
[06:50] does is it basically gives us an ID of
[06:52] the file that exists in our Google
[06:54] Drive. So keep that in mind. We'll have
[06:56] to use this ID later. And just to show
[06:57] you guys, here's my folder called RS.
[06:59] And this is the new one we just got.
[07:01] Okay. So the next thing to do is we want
[07:03] to have a switch that sends the data
[07:04] different ways based on the file type.
[07:06] So I'm going to add a new node. I'm
[07:08] going to type in switch. And what I'm
[07:11] going to do here is first of all we're
[07:12] just going to worry about word docs
[07:14] because that's what we have right here.
[07:15] And then we'll come back later and do
[07:16] PDF and text file. So what I'm going to
[07:18] do is look on this lefth hand side where
[07:20] we can see some metadata about that file
[07:22] that we just uploaded. And right here
[07:23] you can see application/b blah blah blah
[07:26] xml office document word whatever. So
[07:28] this basically means this is a word doc.
[07:30] So I'm going to grab mime type right
[07:32] here. And basically what we're going to
[07:34] say is if the mime type variable equals
[07:37] this which means word doc then we're
[07:40] going to go down this path. I'm going to
[07:41] rename this path word. So when we
[07:44] execute this it's going to go down this
[07:46] word path branch. And it's the only one
[07:48] right now. So maybe it seems like it's
[07:50] not working. But if I was to add two
[07:51] other routing rules which these will be
[07:53] PDF and text file and hit execute step.
[07:55] It will still go down that word branch.
[07:58] Okay. So this next step is probably the
[08:00] most confusing out of the entire
[08:01] workflow, but it's not too bad. So let's
[08:03] just get past it real quick. And that is
[08:04] converting the Word document to a Google
[08:07] doc. The reason we have to do that is
[08:08] because there's all these different ways
[08:10] we can extract text from a document in
[08:12] Nitn, but there's really not a great way
[08:14] to do it from a Word doc. So we just
[08:16] want to convert it. So how we do that is
[08:18] I'm going to add a new node right here,
[08:19] and it's going to be an HTTP request.
[08:22] I'm not going to go super super granular
[08:24] here, but if you want to learn more
[08:25] about APIs in Nitn, check out this video
[08:27] up here. Okay, but now that we got that
[08:29] out of the way, what I'm going to do is
[08:30] I'm going to hit Google Drive API to
[08:33] convert it. So, right here, I have the
[08:35] documentation. And this basically shows
[08:36] us the method we need to make, the
[08:38] endpoint we need to hit, and what else
[08:40] we need to put in here. So, what I'm
[08:41] going to do is copy this endpoint right
[08:43] here, and then I'm going to go back into
[08:45] Nitn and paste that right there. We can
[08:47] also see that the endpoint required a
[08:49] post method. So, I'm going to make sure
[08:50] I change the method to post. We can see
[08:52] right here that the endpoint has right
[08:54] here a parameter for us to fill in,
[08:56] which is the file ID that we want to
[08:58] convert. So, I'm going to delete that.
[08:59] I'm going to change this to an
[09:00] expression. And I'm going to drag the ID
[09:03] from this lefth hand side right into
[09:04] here, which tells this API which file to
[09:07] convert to Google Doc. And then the last
[09:10] thing we want to do is not just make a
[09:11] copy of it, we want to convert it. So if
[09:13] I go back to the API documentation, you
[09:15] can see right here we have a parameter
[09:17] which is convert which says whether to
[09:19] convert this file to corresponding docs
[09:21] editor format. So all I have to do is
[09:23] add in this query parameter. So I'm
[09:24] going to go back in here. I'm going to
[09:26] add a question mark which basically
[09:27] means anything after this is like a
[09:28] filter or a setting and I'm going to
[09:30] type convert equals true because it's
[09:34] either a true or false. And now we
[09:36] should be set up but we have to
[09:37] authenticate ourselves. And this is
[09:39] really easy because over here you've
[09:40] already connected to Google Drive. So
[09:42] all you have to do is choose predefined
[09:44] credential type. You'll type in here
[09:46] Google Drive ooth 2. So right here. And
[09:51] then you're already connected with that
[09:52] same Google Oath. All right. So what I'm
[09:55] going to do now is I'm going to hit
[09:56] execute step. This is basically just
[09:58] making a copy of our original Word doc
[10:00] for Jordan Reeves resume. And it's
[10:02] making a copy of it in our Google Drive
[10:04] but as a Google doc. So if I go into my
[10:06] resume folder and I hit refresh, we
[10:09] should see we have two of them. And this
[10:11] one's a word doc. And then the one we
[10:12] just copied is now a Google doc. So this
[10:15] is the one we can pull into edit end and
[10:16] actually use to get the text from it.
[10:19] And so just to call out basically this
[10:20] returns information and it gives us a
[10:22] different ID which would be sorry
[10:24] there's a lot of different IDs. It would
[10:26] be this one right here. Not the one
[10:28] that's like in the parent object over
[10:30] here. It's not this ID. It is the one
[10:33] over here. Okay. So now that we have it
[10:35] in our Google Drive, the next thing we
[10:36] need to do is download it back into
[10:38] NIDN. So, I'm going to click on the
[10:39] plus. We're going to add a drive node,
[10:42] and this is going to be download file.
[10:44] And then we're able to use that ID to
[10:45] pull it in. So, I'm just going to scroll
[10:47] down to that ID that I told you guys it
[10:49] was not the one in the parents. We're
[10:51] going to scroll past parents, and we
[10:52] should see right here ID. So, I'll drag
[10:54] that in there. And then, this is an
[10:56] important step. What we want to do is
[10:57] add an option. We want to do a Google
[10:59] file conversion and add a conversion.
[11:01] So, this is basically just saying, okay,
[11:02] whenever we're pulling in a Google Doc,
[11:04] we're going to turn it into this format,
[11:06] which is going to be PDF. We'll just
[11:08] keep it as PDF. So, I know it's weird
[11:10] that we converted a Word to a doc and
[11:12] now we're converting a doc to a PDF, but
[11:15] just stick with me. So, now we have our
[11:16] resume over here as a PDF and then it's
[11:18] super easy. We're going to add another
[11:19] node. We're going to type extract and
[11:22] we're going to be extracting text from a
[11:24] PDF. All we have to do is make sure that
[11:26] the input binary field right here
[11:27] matches the field right here. And when
[11:29] we hit execute step, we get basically
[11:32] all the actual text back from the
[11:34] resume. Okay. Okay, so we're just going
[11:36] to continue and build the rest of the
[11:37] logic for the whole workflow and then
[11:39] we'll come back and we'll set up PDF and
[11:42] text. But what's next is that we want to
[11:44] standardize the input. So I'm going to
[11:46] add a node and I'm going to call this
[11:48] one set. We'll just call this like
[11:50] standardize.
[11:52] And all I have to do is basically we
[11:53] want to set everything that's coming in
[11:56] all of the resume text which would be
[11:58] down here in one field. So we're setting
[12:01] it to a field called text and it's being
[12:02] referenced as JSON.ext. So, we have to
[12:05] make sure later that PDFs come through,
[12:07] text files come through, and they all
[12:09] feed into this node in a field called
[12:11] text. So, we'll set that all up later,
[12:12] but what I'm going to do is just execute
[12:14] this step. We now have just the resume
[12:16] content right here.
[12:20] What if you could turn your next product
[12:21] idea into a working business this
[12:23] weekend? As someone constantly working
[12:25] with AI agents, I'm always looking for
[12:26] ways to help improve my workflow and
[12:28] efficiency. And with the sponsor of
[12:29] today's video, Hostinger Horizons, I
[12:31] don't need to wait around for someone
[12:32] else to build a tool that will improve
[12:34] my workflow. They are the all-in-one AI
[12:35] partner. They combine design,
[12:37] development, and writing skills and also
[12:39] integrate with the likes of Stripe and
[12:40] Superbase. With Horizons, I can build a
[12:42] web app that can fully automate many
[12:43] processes in my business, giving me more
[12:45] time to work on it instead of in it. For
[12:47] example, when you come to sell your AI
[12:48] agents and services, it's great practice
[12:50] to refine and improve your service using
[12:51] real world feedback. But getting usable
[12:53] and in-depth feedback is super tedious
[12:55] and timeconuming. So, I'm using Horizons
[12:57] to generate a feedback collection tool
[12:58] that I can send out to my clients. I'm
[13:00] going to start with one of their 30 plus
[13:01] no code ideas for this, but I'll tweak
[13:03] it to suit my own needs. I know with AI
[13:05] agents, some of the people I'm selling
[13:06] to will be in the market for this
[13:07] service for the first time. So, one
[13:08] thing I need to always understand is
[13:10] whether or not my service matched their
[13:12] expectations. I'm using a prompt here to
[13:13] make sure this is added to my feedback.
[13:15] And just like that, no code required for
[13:17] me to add this, and it has been updated
[13:18] in my feedback collection tool. I can
[13:20] even change the look and feel in one
[13:22] prompt to match my company's branding,
[13:23] keeping everything clean. Once you're
[13:24] done, it only takes one click to go
[13:26] live. I'll hit the publish button right
[13:27] here, and I'm all set. And another thing
[13:29] that I really like about Hostinger is
[13:30] that their expert support is there
[13:31] anytime you need it. It's around 24/7.
[13:34] It's multilingual, so you're never stuck
[13:35] for too long. Everything you need to
[13:37] have a great online presence is in one
[13:38] place, as they include email, hosting,
[13:40] and domains, too. If you want to give
[13:42] Horizons a try to help scale and grow
[13:43] your business, or even to test launch a
[13:45] new idea, use my code, Nate Herk, to get
[13:47] 10% off your first month. Okay, so what
[13:49] comes next after this is we want to go
[13:51] ahead and download the job description.
[13:54] So right here I have a Google doc which
[13:55] is the job title about the role,
[13:57] responsibilities, qualifications, all
[13:58] this kind of stuff. And we need to get
[14:00] this into Naden so that our agent can
[14:02] look at it. So I'm going to add another
[14:03] node. We've got a lot of Google Drive
[14:05] nodes today. And this is going to be
[14:06] another download file. And I'm basically
[14:08] just going to choose from a list rather
[14:09] than giving it an ID because I know what
[14:11] this one's called. So I'm going to grab
[14:12] in job title. And obviously if you had
[14:15] multiple different roles, you could just
[14:16] come in here and switch that. And once
[14:18] again, I'm going to do another Google
[14:19] file conversion. And I'm going to turn
[14:20] this Google doc into a PDF. We'll hit
[14:23] execute step and now we get the PDF. And
[14:26] then same thing that we did from over
[14:27] here. So I'm actually just going to copy
[14:28] and paste this node. We're going to
[14:30] extract text from PDF. So I'll run that.
[14:32] And now we're getting the actual job
[14:34] description right over here. Job title
[14:37] AI solutions architect. Okay. So we have
[14:40] the resume, we have the job title and
[14:43] description. Now we want to feed it into
[14:45] an AI to analyze the two of them. So I'm
[14:48] going to click on the plus and I'm going
[14:50] to add an AI agent. And now that we have
[14:53] this AI agent, we need to set up two
[14:54] things. The user message and the system
[14:57] message. The user message is like, hey,
[14:59] here's dynamic information that I'm
[15:01] giving you. Here's our conversation. And
[15:03] so what we want to give it as a user
[15:05] message is the candidates's resume. And
[15:08] then when we add a system message, this
[15:09] is basically its instructions. This is
[15:11] its role. So in the system message,
[15:13] we'll say, hey, you are an expert
[15:15] recruiter. You're going to be given a
[15:17] resume. You're going to be given a job
[15:19] description. and you're going to output
[15:21] the following things to me. So, first
[15:23] let's set up the actual resume real
[15:25] quick. I'm going to change this to
[15:26] define below and I'm going to change
[15:28] this to an expression. And let's just
[15:30] open this up full screen. I'm going to
[15:32] type in candidates resume and then a
[15:35] colon just so the agent knows what we're
[15:37] giving it. And all I have to do now is
[15:38] I'm going to go back to the node where
[15:40] we standardized the resume input and I'm
[15:42] going to drag in the text. So now the
[15:44] agent's looking at Jordan Reeves resume
[15:46] and his skills, all this kind of stuff.
[15:48] And then for the system message, when we
[15:49] open this up, I'm going to make an
[15:51] expression, make it full screen, and get
[15:52] rid of this. I'm going to paste in this
[15:54] system message real quick. And you guys
[15:55] can take a screenshot of this system
[15:57] message and give it to Chatbt and
[15:58] extract the text from it, or I'll drop
[16:00] it in my free school community. And I'll
[16:02] also drop this entire workflow in my
[16:04] free school community. So, if you want
[16:05] to download it, you certainly can. That
[16:07] community will also be linked in the
[16:08] description. And what you would do is
[16:09] you'd come into here, you'd click on
[16:11] YouTube resources, or you'd search for
[16:12] the title of this video. And like, let's
[16:14] say this is a video. You would right
[16:16] here have the JSON file of the workflow
[16:18] to download and then I'd also attach a
[16:20] PDF of the prompts or something like
[16:21] that. Anyways, at a high level, I'm
[16:23] saying you are an expert technical
[16:24] recruiter specializing in AI automation
[16:26] and software roles. You have been given
[16:28] a job description and a candidate
[16:29] resume. Your task is to analyze the
[16:31] resume in relation to the job
[16:32] description and provide a detailed
[16:34] screening report. And then I told it
[16:36] what I wanted to do like as far as
[16:37] output. So, we wanted to give us
[16:39] candidate strengths, candidate
[16:40] weaknesses, the risk factor, the reward
[16:43] factor, an overall fit rating out of 10,
[16:46] and then a justification for that
[16:47] rating. And then finally, we're giving
[16:49] it a variable, which is the job
[16:51] description.
[16:52] And that is exactly why we pulled it in
[16:54] over here and extracted the text from
[16:55] it. So, I just dragged in this variable
[16:57] right here. And you can see what that
[16:59] comes through as is our entire job
[17:00] description over here. So, now it has
[17:02] all the context it needs. And it's also
[17:04] been system prompted. But before we can
[17:06] run this, we need to connect a brain. So
[17:08] I'm going to click on the chat model
[17:09] button, and I'm just going to choose a
[17:11] open AI chat model because I want to use
[17:13] a reasoning model. You don't necessarily
[17:16] have to do that. You can play around
[17:17] with different models, but for this
[17:18] case, I want to go with 04 mini. And
[17:22] we're going to use OpenAI's reasoning
[17:23] model in order to reason through
[17:24] everything we told it to do. So now that
[17:27] we have that set up, I can go ahead and
[17:29] hit this play button above the recruiter
[17:30] agent, and it's going to spit out that
[17:32] analysis. So, that just finished up and
[17:34] we're going to look at it, but we're
[17:36] going to realize we have an issue. So,
[17:37] it did everything we wanted. It gave us
[17:39] our strengths. It gave us our
[17:40] weaknesses. It gave everything in one
[17:42] field. And this would not be very easy
[17:44] to drag into a Google Sheet template.
[17:47] So, what we need to do is have it output
[17:49] everything differently. So, I'm going to
[17:50] click on require specific output format.
[17:52] And what this does is it allows us to
[17:54] add a structured output parser. So, I'm
[17:56] going to add a structured output parser
[17:57] and click on structured output parser.
[17:59] I'm going to change the schema type to
[18:01] define using JSON schema. And then I'm
[18:03] going to paste in this structured output
[18:05] parser, which once again, if you guys
[18:06] download the template and go to the free
[18:08] school, you'll be able to copy this
[18:09] exact template for free. So basically,
[18:12] this is just telling it how to output
[18:13] everything in different fields.
[18:16] So, if I hit play and we run the exact
[18:18] same agent, exact same prompt, exact
[18:20] same resume, you'll see that it's going
[18:22] to give us our strengths, weaknesses,
[18:24] all the stuff we asked for in different
[18:26] fields. And we'll be able to drag it
[18:28] later into Google Sheets really easily.
[18:30] So, there we go. It just finished up and
[18:31] now we have a list of candidate
[18:33] strengths. It found seven things. It
[18:35] found four weaknesses. It said low risk
[18:37] factor with an explanation, high reward
[18:40] factor, a nine overall rating, and a
[18:42] justification. And it's also a lot
[18:44] easier to just read and look at. And so
[18:46] the last thing I want to do here is we
[18:48] just want to pull out the candidates's
[18:49] first name, last name, and email address
[18:52] because we don't actually have that
[18:53] separated yet. We could have easily made
[18:55] this recruiter agent do that, but I just
[18:56] didn't want to overload it with too much
[18:58] stuff. We wanted it to specifically
[19:00] focus on the analysis. And I also wanted
[19:03] to show you guys a cool node you can
[19:04] use, which is called the information
[19:06] extractor.
[19:08] So this node looks at a block of text
[19:10] and it pulls out certain things that you
[19:12] define. So, first thing is what text to
[19:14] look at. I'm going to pull in the
[19:17] standardized resume once again. So, it's
[19:19] looking at Jordan's resume. And then we
[19:21] tell it what to pull out. So, I'm just
[19:23] going to say first name. And a quick
[19:25] description of that is the first name of
[19:28] the candidate.
[19:30] This is going to be a required field.
[19:34] We're also going to add last name. So,
[19:35] I'm just going to copy and paste this
[19:36] stuff down here. And we're just going to
[19:38] say last instead of first.
[19:42] We will also make this one required. And
[19:44] then the final one will be email. And
[19:46] we'll just say the email address of the
[19:47] candidate, which will also be a required
[19:50] field. And typically what I would do is
[19:51] I would just have the email address be
[19:53] the sender of the email that triggered
[19:55] it. But in this case, that was me. And I
[19:57] just want to show you guys that it can
[19:58] pull out an email. So these are the
[20:00] three things that the agent's looking
[20:01] for. And this node uses AI to read and
[20:04] analyze. So I'm going to plug in the
[20:05] chat model once again just to the same
[20:07] one to keep things clean. And if I hit
[20:09] run above this information extractor, it
[20:11] will pull out first name, last name, and
[20:14] email address. All right, there we go.
[20:16] We have Jordan Reeves and Jordan.
[20:19] Proi.dev.
[20:21] Okay, so now we're pretty much done. We
[20:22] just have to write all the data back to
[20:24] our Google sheet. So I'm going to click
[20:26] on the plus. I'm going to type in sheets
[20:28] and we're going to do append row in
[20:29] sheet. If you guys want to follow along,
[20:31] you can download this exact template by
[20:32] the way for free also in my free school
[20:34] community and you'll make a copy and
[20:36] then you can just pretty much map
[20:37] everything the same way I do here. So,
[20:39] let's go back into our Nitn. We're going
[20:41] to choose the document to pull from or
[20:43] to write into which is ré screener.
[20:46] We're going to choose the sheet which is
[20:47] just sheet one. And then it's going to
[20:49] pull up with all the columns here. And
[20:51] we can configure what to send over. So,
[20:53] the first thing is date. I'm going to
[20:54] make this an expression. And I'm going
[20:56] to do two curly braces and do dollar
[20:57] sign now, which pulls up the date. I'm
[21:00] real quick just going to format this so
[21:02] it looks a little cleaner. So I'm going
[21:03] to do dot format, which now we have the
[21:05] date like this. But then also I want to
[21:07] add a time stamp. So I'm going to do h
[21:10] colon a nope m space a. And that now
[21:15] gives us the um 11:07 a.m. So every time
[21:19] a new resume comes in, we'll get the
[21:21] time stamp that it came in as well. All
[21:22] right. And now we're going to put in the
[21:24] actual resume. And by résé, I mean the
[21:26] link because we put it into our Google
[21:28] Drive. So I'm going to do that right
[21:29] here where it says upload to drive. We
[21:31] want to look at the output from this
[21:32] node because it will give us a web view
[21:35] link right here. So I can drag that in.
[21:37] And now we have a database in Google
[21:38] Sheets where we can see all the
[21:39] information about a candidate. And also
[21:41] just go ahead and click on that resume
[21:42] if we want to. And then the rest of this
[21:44] is very very drag and drop. We've got
[21:46] first name, last name, and email which
[21:48] we just got. So let me put these in
[21:49] here. And now we have the output of our
[21:51] recruiter agent. So, I open this guy up.
[21:53] We can see strengths. I'm going to put
[21:55] in strengths. And what I'm going to do
[21:56] real quick is I'm just going to do a
[21:58] quick function to make this more
[22:00] readable. So, at the end, I'm going to
[22:01] type dot join.
[22:04] And then in the parenthesis, I'm going
[22:05] to do two quotes. And then I'm going to
[22:07] do n to make two new lines. And now we
[22:11] can see it's basically just a lot more
[22:13] readable. And I'm just going to copy
[22:15] that join function because we're going
[22:17] to use it again for weaknesses. If I
[22:19] close out of strengths, there's our
[22:21] weaknesses. and I'm going to do paste.
[22:23] So now we have that a lot cleaner as
[22:24] well.
[22:27] Now we want to do risk factor. So what
[22:28] I'm going to do is open this guy up and
[22:30] I'm basically just going to drag in the
[22:32] score. I'm going to manually hit enter
[22:34] twice and then do an explanation. So we
[22:36] can see like that. I'm going to do the
[22:38] exact same thing for the reward factor.
[22:40] So we'll do the score. Enter. Enter
[22:43] explanation. And then we have our last
[22:45] ones which are overall fit and
[22:47] justification for rating. And we should
[22:49] be mapped up. So, all I have to do now
[22:50] is hit execute step. We'll go into the
[22:52] sheet and we'll watch that data about
[22:54] Jordan Reeves pop in here. All right,
[22:57] cool. And real quick, we can see we have
[22:58] the strengths and weaknesses. We have
[23:00] the risk factor, which is low. The
[23:02] candidate is highly aligned with the
[23:03] core requirements. Worst case scenario
[23:05] involves a short ramp up on unfamiliar
[23:07] LLM providers or internal governance
[23:09] processes. We've got a high reward
[23:11] factor. Best case scenario is the
[23:13] candidate immediately drives multiple AI
[23:15] projects, reduces delivery time via
[23:17] reusable architectures and becomes a
[23:20] long-term strategic leader. We've got an
[23:22] overall fit of nine and then some
[23:23] justification there. So, we've done all
[23:25] the heavy lifting. Now, all we have to
[23:27] do is come back in here and just set up
[23:29] the two other um file types which are
[23:32] PDF or text file. Okay, so I just set
[23:34] myself a new email with a different
[23:36] resume. So, I'll test the step and now
[23:37] we can see we have Tara Lopez which is a
[23:40] PDF. So next step, we're just going to
[23:42] upload it to our drive. And then we're
[23:44] going to open up this switch to set up
[23:45] the next route, which is PDF.
[23:48] So once again, all I have to do is the
[23:50] mime type variable right here.
[23:53] And we're going to say if the mime type
[23:55] equals application/ PDF, this means it's
[23:58] going to go down this branch, which is
[24:00] called PDF. So I'll hit execute step.
[24:02] And we can now see it goes down the PDF
[24:04] branch, which is right here in the
[24:06] middle. So that's exactly what we wanted
[24:07] to do. And now it's much easier than up
[24:09] top. We don't have to make an HTTP
[24:10] request. We can just download the file
[24:13] from Google Drive. We can choose by ID
[24:16] and I can drag the ID in right here. And
[24:18] we don't even have to do a file
[24:19] conversion. We can literally just hit
[24:21] execute step. So I'll hit execute step
[24:23] and we will see over here we get the
[24:24] actual file which is a PDF. And then
[24:28] once again we're just going to extract
[24:29] from PDF. So I'm going to copy the same
[24:31] node from earlier and now we're
[24:33] extracting the text out of it. So you
[24:35] can see over here we have our resume in
[24:38] a field called text which is perfect
[24:40] because we can now just drag it into
[24:41] this set node and it's going to come
[24:43] through whether it is a word doc or PDF.
[24:46] It always gets standardized right here.
[24:48] And now the rest of the process is easy.
[24:49] I'm basically just going to hit play on
[24:51] the Google sheet and that's going to run
[24:52] everything else which is getting the job
[24:54] description. Our recruiter agent is now
[24:56] reasoning and giving us an analysis.
[24:58] It's going to extract the name and email
[25:00] once again and then we'll pop over to
[25:02] Google sheet and we'll see that
[25:04] everything ran as expected. Okay, so
[25:06] here we are just waiting for this to pop
[25:08] in. There it goes. One thing I'll show
[25:09] real quick is that we could click onto
[25:11] this and we will see um the resume. We
[25:14] can also do it up here for Jordan as you
[25:16] can see. There you go. There's Jordan's
[25:18] resume and we can see that Tara was
[25:20] rated a three on the overall fit scale.
[25:22] We can go ahead and look at the risk,
[25:24] the reward, the justification. But let's
[25:26] just go back into edit end and set up
[25:27] the last branch, which is a text file.
[25:29] Okay, so just sent myself a text file.
[25:31] Let's pull it in and see if we have
[25:32] Brian Chen's resume as text. We can even
[25:35] view it and see the text right here. I'm
[25:37] going to upload it to Drive and then we
[25:38] can set up this final switch, which is
[25:40] for a text file. Okay, I'm going to open
[25:42] up the switch and like I said, we've
[25:43] just set up this one. We're going to do
[25:45] the same exact thing. Drag in the mine
[25:46] type. We're going to grab the result and
[25:49] we're saying if the mine type variable
[25:50] equals text/plain, that means it's going
[25:53] to go down this branch called text. So
[25:55] we'll run it. We'll see that it goes
[25:56] down this final branch at the bottom.
[25:58] And now we basically just have to do the
[26:00] same thing as up here where we download
[26:01] the file and extract the text. All
[26:03] right, so I got to get this stuff out of
[26:04] my way. I'm going to add a new node down
[26:06] here, which is going to be another
[26:07] drive. We're going to download a file.
[26:10] We're going to do it by ID. And I'm just
[26:12] going to drag in the ID from the left to
[26:14] right there. And now I'm going to
[26:15] execute the step. And we should see we
[26:16] get our text file over here. Okay, there
[26:19] we go. Text file. And now I just real
[26:21] quick want to extract text from it. So
[26:23] I'm going to type extract. I'm going to
[26:25] do extract from text file. And then one
[26:28] thing we have to do real quick is we
[26:30] have to change the output field to text
[26:35] because remember when we standardize the
[26:36] inputs, we want to make sure everything
[26:38] comes out in a field called text. And
[26:40] now it comes through over here. If we
[26:42] didn't do that, it wouldn't match up
[26:43] right here and we wouldn't be capturing
[26:45] anything. So, now that we've
[26:46] standardized all three inputs, we know
[26:48] we're good to go on that front. I can
[26:49] once again just hit run on this Google
[26:51] sheet and it will go do everything else
[26:53] that we already set up. So, there we go.
[26:54] It's finishing up. Let's hop into the
[26:56] sheet and we will watch Brian Chen's
[26:57] information pop in. Unfortunately, he's
[27:00] only a one overall fit for this job. And
[27:03] as you can see, we can click into this
[27:04] node and we can see his text file
[27:06] resume, which I would never recommend to
[27:08] submit a resume that looks like this.
[27:10] And that's basically it. We just built a
[27:12] smart AI resume screening system.
[27:14] Obviously, there's a few ways you can
[27:15] come in here and customize it. You'd
[27:17] want to change out the trigger to match
[27:18] yours. You'd want to change the job
[27:20] description to match yours. And you
[27:22] could even change the recruiter agent if
[27:23] you want to get different types of
[27:24] insights. And then we write it back to
[27:26] our database where we can now have an
[27:28] automated system for whenever someone
[27:30] submits an application. We can get a bit
[27:32] of a brief already done for us that we
[27:34] can look at after we take an initial
[27:36] pass through or we can use it to help us
[27:38] take our initial pass through. So, I
[27:39] hope you guys followed this step-by-step
[27:41] tutorial and you learned a lot during
[27:42] the process. Once again, if you want to
[27:44] download the workflow, I will have this
[27:45] one set up for you guys with sticky
[27:47] notes and a full setup guide when you
[27:48] download it in case you just want to hop
[27:50] right in and test it out. But if you
[27:51] enjoy this type of content and you're
[27:53] looking for some more structured
[27:54] guidance on wireframing and a full
[27:56] course on building automations with NN,
[27:58] then definitely check out my plus
[27:59] community. The link for that will be
[28:00] down in the description. We've got a
[28:01] great community of members who are using
[28:02] NN every single day, building
[28:04] automations, sharing their wins, sharing
[28:05] their challenges, and sharing their
[28:07] projects. And of course, we have a
[28:09] classroom with two full courses right
[28:11] now. Agent zero, which is the
[28:12] foundations of AI automation. And then
[28:14] we have 10 hours to 10 seconds where you
[28:16] learn how to pick the process, map the
[28:18] steps, and end foundations, triggers,
[28:20] nodes, AI prompting, all this kind of
[28:22] stuff. Full course on NN. Anyways, would
[28:24] love to see you guys in that community.
[28:25] But that's going to do it for this
[28:26] video. If you enjoyed, if you learned
[28:28] something new, please give it a like. It
[28:29] definitely helps me out a ton. And as
[28:31] always, I appreciate you guys sticking
[28:32] to the end of the video with me. I will
[28:34] see you on the next one. Thanks so much,
[28:36] guys.
