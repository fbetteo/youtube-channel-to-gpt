[00:00] I just built this AI system that 100%
[00:01] automates viral shorts like these while
[00:03] you
[00:06] sleep. As you can see, it's a pretty
[00:08] simple five-step system and we didn't
[00:10] have to write any code. Step one is
[00:12] we're grabbing the main story from our
[00:13] Google sheet and we're feeding it into
[00:15] an AI agent to create those prompts.
[00:17] Then step two is we're going to use Flux
[00:18] to create those images and they turn out
[00:20] super high quality. Step three is we're
[00:21] going to feed those images into Cling to
[00:23] turn them into videos and these also
[00:25] turn out super high quality. Then we're
[00:26] going to use 11 Labs to create one
[00:28] unique sound effect for each video. Step
[00:30] five, we're going to use Creatmate to
[00:31] render all the video files and audio
[00:33] files together in one video. And then
[00:35] we're going to be using Botato to auto
[00:37] post to Instagram, Tik Tok, and YouTube.
[00:39] As always, I'm giving away all the
[00:41] resources that you need for free. So
[00:42] later in the video, I'll talk about how
[00:44] you can access all those resources and
[00:45] how you can actually plug them in and
[00:47] what you need to set up on your end so
[00:48] you can have the system running in less
[00:50] than 10 minutes. So, let's do a live run
[00:52] and then we'll walk through looking at
[00:53] every single node in detail so you guys
[00:55] can see exactly how I built this system.
[00:57] Okay. So, before we test this workflow,
[00:58] we have to go look at the Google sheet
[01:00] template that you guys will be able to
[01:01] access, of course. And this is what it
[01:02] looks like. We basically have a category
[01:04] and then we're going to have four brands
[01:05] within that category. And this is what
[01:07] the workflow is pulling from to start
[01:09] the whole process. And then it's going
[01:10] to come back and throw that final URL
[01:12] back in the sheet. So, before we hit
[01:14] test workflow and process fast food
[01:15] giants, we're going to take a look at
[01:17] these examples real quick. So these
[01:19] three outputs came from our NN workflow.
[01:20] Let's take a look at the sneaker
[01:23] [Music]
[01:41] brands. Next up we have gaming brands.
[01:49] [Music]
[02:03] That was funny. And the Nintendo one. I
[02:05] even saw like a bunch of mini like Mario
[02:06] and Luigi's down here. Finally, we'll
[02:08] look at this tech giants one.
[02:11] [Music]
[02:21] [Music]
[02:26] So, as you can see, they were super
[02:28] cinematic. They had little people
[02:29] walking around. You could immediately
[02:30] tell which brand it was as soon as you
[02:32] saw the video. So, we're going to go
[02:33] back into the workflow. I'm going to hit
[02:35] test workflow. And this should be
[02:36] pulling in the first item in the sheet
[02:39] that's marked as to-do. So this one
[02:41] should be processing fast food chains.
[02:43] And if we click into this node right
[02:44] here, we can see this one did pull in
[02:46] fast food chains. So this is pretty much
[02:47] what starts the process. The schedule
[02:49] trigger before this one you could set to
[02:50] run three times a day, four times a day,
[02:52] once a day, whatever times you want. But
[02:54] let's just say right now we're running
[02:55] this once a day. It would hit this
[02:57] Google sheet and it would basically look
[02:58] for any row that has the status column
[03:00] equaling to-do just so we know we're not
[03:02] processing rows that have already been
[03:04] created. And then it's only going to
[03:06] pull back one item. So that way you can
[03:07] fill the sheet up with 100 items, but
[03:09] it's only going to process one at a
[03:10] time. And as you can see right here,
[03:12] that is fast food chains with these four
[03:14] fast food brands. From there, what we do
[03:16] is we're basically just setting brands
[03:18] into one array. And this is just so we
[03:19] can split them back out later in the
[03:21] next node over here where we're
[03:22] splitting them out into four individual
[03:24] items. And the reason we want to get
[03:25] them, you know, a little bit of data
[03:27] manipulation to get them into four
[03:28] unique items is because we want to
[03:30] process four images, four videos, and
[03:32] four audio files. So running four items
[03:34] through the rest of the workflow is how
[03:36] we can accomplish that. Once we have
[03:37] those as four individual items, we're
[03:39] going to go into this prompt generator
[03:40] agent which is going to do a few things.
[03:43] So first thing I want to call out is
[03:45] that in the user message, we're giving
[03:47] it the category and a brand. And there's
[03:50] going to be four different ones. So if
[03:51] you see if I click into this, we
[03:53] basically just have the actual category.
[03:55] So I went from here and I pulled the
[03:56] category in and then I said brand colon
[03:59] and then I pulled in the brand from
[04:00] here. And like I said, this is going to
[04:02] process four different runs. So we have
[04:04] fast food chains brand McDonald's,
[04:06] In-N-Out, Taco Bell, and Chick-fil-A. So
[04:08] that's the user message, but now we have
[04:10] the system message, which is telling the
[04:11] AI agent how to behave and what its
[04:13] instructions are. So I'm going to open
[04:15] up the system prompt. Not going to read
[04:16] the whole thing because you can download
[04:18] this template and you'll have access to
[04:19] it. But we're just going to talk about
[04:21] highle what's going on. So, for the
[04:22] overview of the agent, I wrote, "You are
[04:24] a multimodal creative AI that transforms
[04:26] famous brands into tiny, hyperrealistic,
[04:29] visually satisfying digital resources.
[04:31] You'll be given a well-known brand, and
[04:32] your job is to output a highly detailed
[04:34] image prompt, a cinematic video prompt,
[04:37] and an immersive audio prompt. And those
[04:39] are kind of the three elements that we
[04:40] need from this thing in order to pass
[04:42] those on the rest of the flow when we're
[04:44] generating the images, generating the
[04:45] videos, and generating that audio. And
[04:48] the way we're able to actually get it to
[04:49] output these things and their individual
[04:52] fields over here is because we turn on
[04:54] this option called require specific
[04:55] output format. And what that does is it
[04:57] adds one more option under the AI agent
[04:59] for us to attach a structured output
[05:01] parser which if we follow the line over
[05:03] here basically this says okay for each
[05:05] item you're going to output the brand's
[05:06] name, an image prompt, a video prompt,
[05:08] and an audio prompt. And that's exactly
[05:10] what we get back over here for our four
[05:12] different brands. As you can see,
[05:13] McDonald's, In-N-Out, Taco Bell, and
[05:16] Chick-fil-A. And then the final thing to
[05:17] call out is that we're using Open Router
[05:19] for the chat model and we're accessing
[05:21] OpenAI's GPT 4.1 chat model. All right,
[05:24] so we have all of the prompts that we
[05:26] need. Now we're going to start to create
[05:27] those elements. So the first thing we're
[05:29] doing is making a request to FAL AI,
[05:32] which is going to basically be similar
[05:34] to PI API if you've watched other videos
[05:35] I've done, similar to Open Router
[05:37] honestly, where we're basically just
[05:38] going to access one service that lets us
[05:40] through that service access a ton of
[05:42] different text to image models or a ton
[05:43] of different imagetovideo models. And
[05:45] we're using FAL for both our images and
[05:47] for our videos. So let me explain what
[05:48] that means. So here is FAL AI as you can
[05:51] see. And if I click on explore, you can
[05:53] see that there's just a ton of different
[05:54] models to choose from. So we have image
[05:56] to image, we have image to video, we
[05:58] have image to 3D, we have text to image,
[06:00] text to video, all this kind of stuff.
[06:01] And so what we did is we went to text to
[06:03] image. And we're using this one right
[06:05] here, which is Flux Pro V1.1 Ultra.
[06:08] We're using this for our text to image
[06:10] generation. So when you click into here,
[06:11] what you can do is in this playground
[06:13] environment, you can basically like
[06:14] enter in a prompts like this. And you
[06:16] can hit run. And this is how you can
[06:18] test out what prompts are going to give
[06:19] you what sort of result in foul with
[06:22] Flux Pro. And as you can see down here,
[06:23] it says that your request will cost 6
[06:25] cents per image. And this is the image
[06:26] that it got based on this prompt. So
[06:28] what I would do is just test out a few
[06:30] of the image prompts that the AI agent
[06:31] spits out to us in NN. And if I like it,
[06:34] then I'll move forward. And as you can
[06:35] see, if I click on requests, you can see
[06:36] all of these different images that we
[06:38] just have generated through this
[06:39] account. Here's a sneak peek at the
[06:40] Chick-fil-A and the In-N-Out and the
[06:42] Taco Bell stuff, but we'll see the full
[06:43] video later. Anyways, what we want to do
[06:45] is click on API, and this is going to
[06:46] show us how we can connect to this model
[06:49] through FAL in NAD. So, what we have to
[06:52] do to call the API is we have to copy
[06:54] this URL. We have to put in our
[06:56] credential. We have to put in the
[06:57] content type, put in a prompt, all this
[06:59] kind of stuff. So, the first thing I do
[07:01] real quick is go to foul and go to API
[07:03] keys. And then you're just going to have
[07:05] to create a new key and copy that. And
[07:07] that's what we need to put in when we're
[07:08] in NAN. So if we go back to the Flux API
[07:10] documentation, we can see right here
[07:13] that in order to put in our API key,
[07:15] it's going to be a header parameter and
[07:16] it's going to be the name is
[07:18] authorization and the value is going to
[07:19] be key space file API key. So what we
[07:23] want to do right away is save this as a
[07:25] header off. So in authorization, click
[07:26] on generic and generic click on header.
[07:29] And then in header off, you're going to
[07:31] create a new one. And then you're going
[07:32] to do the name is authorization and the
[07:34] value is going to be key space and then
[07:37] paste in your file API key. You'll save
[07:39] that. Save it as foul because we need to
[07:41] use this credential in multiple other
[07:42] nodes in this workflow. But once you
[07:44] have it saved once, you're set. The next
[07:46] thing you need to do is add a header,
[07:47] which is going to be content type with
[07:49] application/json. And then the most
[07:51] important is we're sending over two
[07:52] fields in the body request. The first
[07:54] one's called prompt. And this is just us
[07:56] dragging over the image prompt right
[07:58] here. And that's actually going to send
[08:00] four requests to foul to make images. As
[08:02] you can see, we have the first one for
[08:04] um McDonald's, the second one for
[08:06] In-N-Out, the third one for Taco Bell,
[08:07] and the fourth one for Chick-fil-A. And
[08:09] then the last thing we have to do is
[08:10] make the aspect ratio 9 by6 because
[08:13] obviously we want to make shorts. So,
[08:15] what this is doing is it's hitting foul
[08:17] server. It's hitting the flux model and
[08:19] it's basically saying, okay, we got your
[08:21] prompt and we got your aspect ratio.
[08:22] We're going to work on those images
[08:24] right now. So, that's why we see the
[08:26] status is in Q. We have information
[08:27] about the actual request, but we don't
[08:29] have the request back yet. So what we do
[08:31] is, you know, we played around in the
[08:33] playground. We can see it took about 10
[08:34] seconds. So I just set a wait node for
[08:36] 12 seconds. And then we move on to get
[08:38] the status of that image. And we do this
[08:40] by accessing this next URL, which
[08:42] basically lets us put in that request ID
[08:45] from that first one and check in on the
[08:47] status. So as you can see, we drag in
[08:49] the request ID from that previous node
[08:51] where we generated the images. So right
[08:53] here, put that in there. And now we see
[08:55] that all of them are complete. So we're
[08:57] good to go. And because they're
[08:58] complete, we do this little check just
[09:00] to make sure that all four are complete
[09:01] before we move on. If even one of these
[09:03] was not complete yet, it would basically
[09:05] just come over here, wait three more
[09:07] seconds, and then continuously check in
[09:08] until all four are complete. But they're
[09:11] all complete. So, it moves on to this
[09:12] stage where we're actually going to
[09:13] download those files. And we once again
[09:16] just have to use that request ID from
[09:18] earlier. And now that we've done that,
[09:20] we have four items back. And if I click
[09:21] into this one, this should be our image
[09:23] for McDonald's. If I scroll down a
[09:25] little bit, this should be our image for
[09:28] In-N-Out. There we go. And the other
[09:30] ones would also be the other images, but
[09:32] don't want to spoil it yet. So, that's
[09:34] step two. We have all of the images
[09:36] created for us. And one thing to note is
[09:39] in this node where we're checking the
[09:40] status, we have to once again put in our
[09:42] file credential. And same thing for this
[09:44] one where we're downloading the image,
[09:45] we have to put in our file credential.
[09:47] So, that's why it's super important to
[09:48] just go ahead and save that right away.
[09:50] Okay. But now we have those four images.
[09:52] And now what we want to do is we want to
[09:53] access FA's cling model in order to turn
[09:56] those images into videos. And when we're
[09:58] turning those images into videos, we
[10:00] have to send over to Clling both an
[10:02] image and a video prompt. So I'm going
[10:05] to open up this node and we're going to
[10:06] dive into what's going on here. So once
[10:08] again, we're using foul, but this time
[10:10] we're using a video model called cling.
[10:12] So I'm going to click into cling right
[10:14] here. And same thing, we have like a
[10:15] playground where we can talk about
[10:16] what's what we want and we can give it
[10:18] an image and then we can hit run and it
[10:20] will generate one over here. But what we
[10:22] want to do is go to the API and this
[10:24] again is going to tell us how we can use
[10:26] this in NAD. So this one's very similar
[10:28] to the previous one. We have an endpoint
[10:30] we need to hit. We're going to use that
[10:31] same file credential. We're going to
[10:33] input a prompt, an image URL, but then
[10:35] of course we also want to put in our
[10:37] aspect ratio. So I'm going to head back
[10:39] over to Nitn. I put in the endpoint. I
[10:41] put the method as post. I connect to the
[10:43] file credential we already have. We put
[10:45] content type application/json. And now
[10:47] in the prompt, we're sending over three
[10:49] things or sorry, not prompt, in the body
[10:51] request, we're sending over three
[10:52] things. The prompt is going to be that
[10:54] video prompt that that first AI agent
[10:56] made for us. So all you would have to do
[10:57] is scroll over here to the prompt
[10:59] generator and then drag in the video
[11:00] prompt. And once again, this is going to
[11:02] be doing four separate runs, each for
[11:05] the different brand. And then what we
[11:07] want to do is drag in the image URL for
[11:09] it to turn that image into a video. So
[11:11] right here the node was get images and
[11:13] it gives us a URL. I would just drag
[11:15] that in right there. And once again this
[11:17] is processing four different images as
[11:19] you can see. And finally we're telling
[11:20] it okay this aspect ratio has to be 9x6.
[11:23] It's going to be vertical. It's going to
[11:24] be a short. And once again it takes all
[11:26] those elements and says okay cool. We're
[11:28] working on that. Now these are all in Q.
[11:31] They're all processing. They're not
[11:32] ready yet. So I've seen that those
[11:33] videos take anywhere from 5 to 6
[11:35] minutes. Sometimes a little less. So
[11:37] right here we wait for 5 minutes. And
[11:38] then what we do is once again we check
[11:40] the video status. So we're doing the
[11:42] exact same thing from earlier where we
[11:43] check the video status. We'd be able to
[11:45] find this endpoint to use if we came
[11:46] back in here to the documentation for
[11:48] cling and we just scroll down a little
[11:50] bit. Right here I scrolled past it.
[11:51] Right here is fetch request status. So
[11:53] we're using this endpoint and we're
[11:55] going to put the request ID in there.
[11:56] And then to get the result we're using
[11:57] this endpoint and putting the request ID
[11:59] in there. Once again it's good to follow
[12:01] along with this but if you download this
[12:02] workflow for free you'll be able to just
[12:04] everything will be set up for you
[12:05] already. All you have to do is plug in
[12:07] your own file credential. But as you can
[12:09] see, they all four have come back now as
[12:10] complete. And we're doing the exact same
[12:12] check in this thing basically to see if
[12:15] even one of these is not complete. We're
[12:17] going to loop back. We're going to wait.
[12:18] And this is a method called polling. But
[12:20] anyways, um these all four were done in
[12:23] this case. So we're good. We move on. We
[12:25] download all those videos by using that
[12:27] request ID once again and our file
[12:29] credential of course. And now we have
[12:30] four items, four videos. Let's take a
[12:32] look at this last one. This one should
[12:34] be Chick-fil-A, I believe.
[12:36] So, it looks like a chicken sandwich and
[12:38] there's people walking in the door.
[12:39] Super
[12:41] cool. Let's just take a look at one more
[12:43] down here, which should be for Taco
[12:45] Bell. And just looks like a giant
[12:47] crunchy taco with people walking in.
[12:50] Awesome. All right. So, we have four
[12:52] images. We turn those images into
[12:54] videos. And now we need to get a sound
[12:56] effect for each of those videos. So,
[12:58] what we're doing now is we're making an
[12:59] HTTP request to 11 Labs. So, if I go to
[13:02] 11 Labs and I come down here and I go to
[13:04] my API key, first of all, that's how you
[13:07] can create a new key and copy that in.
[13:08] But then what I'm going to do is click
[13:09] on API documentation. And what I want to
[13:12] do is come down here to sound effects
[13:13] and create sound effect. So, this is
[13:16] going to give us this curl command. Once
[13:17] again, we could copy and paste that into
[13:19] N. We could copy in the endpoint, but
[13:22] this is already going to be set up for
[13:23] you. So, all you have to do is create
[13:25] your 11 Labs credential. And according
[13:27] to the documentation, this is going to
[13:28] be a header off. So, same thing that we
[13:30] did for foul, but when you create this
[13:31] one, instead of saying authorization,
[13:33] we're just going to do xi- API- key. And
[13:36] then you don't have to put keyspace API
[13:38] key. You can just paste in your API key.
[13:41] That's the way that 11 Labs accepts
[13:43] credentials. Cool. So, now that's saved.
[13:45] And what we're going to do is send over
[13:46] a body request with just two things. So,
[13:48] the first one is text. And this is
[13:50] basically just going to be the sound
[13:52] prompt that the original agent gave us
[13:54] all the way down here. So, I would just
[13:56] drag in this audio prompt right into
[13:57] that parameter right there. And then
[13:59] finally, we're just telling 11 Labs,
[14:01] make each audio source 5 seconds long
[14:03] because all the videos are 5 seconds
[14:05] long. All right. So, as you can see, we
[14:06] have these four different audio files.
[14:07] Let's just give one a
[14:08] [Music]
[14:12] listen. Cool. Apparently, that suits
[14:14] McDonald's, but we'll see when we have
[14:16] it all rendered together. Okay. So, now
[14:18] this part's pretty important. We have
[14:20] that audio file, but what we have to do
[14:22] is make it publicly accessible so that
[14:24] create a mate over here when we want to
[14:25] render it all together can actually
[14:26] access it. So, we upload it to drive,
[14:29] which basically just looks like, you
[14:30] know, we sign in with Google. And if
[14:32] you're having trouble with Google
[14:32] credentials, I'll tag a video up here
[14:34] where I walked through how to do that.
[14:36] We're uploading a file and we're
[14:38] inputting a field that's binary called
[14:40] data. So, as you can see over here,
[14:41] there's four different items and they're
[14:43] all called data. So, that's what's being
[14:44] pulled in. Basically, just setting the
[14:46] file name of this um MP3 file. So, I
[14:49] called it fast food chains.mpp3. And the
[14:52] reason I got to fast food chains is I
[14:53] went down to the sheet that triggered
[14:55] this whole workflow. And I just pulled
[14:56] in the category. So, we're getting four
[14:58] audio files in our drive called fast
[14:59] food
[15:00] chains.mpp3. And just choose the actual
[15:03] folder you want that to go to. And so,
[15:04] what we get back over here from Google
[15:06] Drive is basically like an ID for that
[15:08] file as well as some other little
[15:09] information. But all we really care
[15:11] about is that ID. So, there's four
[15:13] different IDs because there's four
[15:14] different audio files. And then we move
[15:15] into this next node to actually make it
[15:17] public because now it's in Google Drive,
[15:19] but it's not public yet. So this next
[15:20] operation is to share a file. We're
[15:22] going to share it by ID. And that's
[15:24] exactly where we just dragged in this ID
[15:25] that we got from that previous node. And
[15:27] we're basically adding a permission that
[15:29] anyone can be a reader of this file. So
[15:31] now it's like completely public. Cool.
[15:32] So we have four videos. We have four
[15:35] audio files that are public. Now we can
[15:37] basically pull everything together. So a
[15:39] little bit more data manipulation here.
[15:41] We're just setting all of the four video
[15:43] files and we're setting all of the four
[15:44] audio files. And if I switch to JSON,
[15:46] you can see this is exactly what it
[15:48] looks like. And we just want to get it
[15:49] like this so we can aggregate everything
[15:51] back together into one clean item. So
[15:53] the next step, that's exactly what I do.
[15:55] I use an aggregate node to just pull all
[15:57] of the incoming items into one field. So
[15:59] now we have video one and audio one,
[16:02] video two and audio 2, video 3 and audio
[16:04] 3, and video four and audio 4. Because
[16:06] that's exactly what we need to do for
[16:07] our next node, which is create a mate.
[16:09] So, let me hop over to Creatmate real
[16:10] quick to show you guys what that looks
[16:12] like. This is the template that we're
[16:13] using, which you guys will be able to
[16:14] access. Don't worry. It's called Famous
[16:16] Brands, but all it is is it's a template
[16:19] that's going to be 20 seconds long, and
[16:21] there's going to be five audio files, or
[16:23] sorry, four 5-second long audio files
[16:25] and four 5-second long video files. So,
[16:27] all we're doing is we're going to send a
[16:29] request to create a mate and say, "Hey,
[16:31] I want to access this template, and here
[16:33] are the four video files, and here are
[16:34] the four audio files." So in order to do
[16:37] that I would click on use template. I
[16:39] would click on API integration. And then
[16:40] you can see this is what would pop up
[16:42] and I can click on copy to clipboard and
[16:44] import this curl into HTTP request in N
[16:48] and we'd be set up already with like our
[16:49] API key and everything. But when you
[16:51] have the template in your own creatate
[16:53] you'll just copy this template ID right
[16:55] here. So you'll copy that come into N
[16:58] and open up this node and you'll just
[17:00] put in your template ID right here
[17:01] instead of mine. And then you just need
[17:03] to swap out your API key right here,
[17:05] which you can get to in creative mate by
[17:07] clicking up here, project settings, and
[17:09] then you can click right here to reveal
[17:11] and copy your API key. And then you just
[17:13] replace it right here. Bearer space your
[17:15] API key. But once that's set up, it's
[17:18] really simple. All we're doing is we're
[17:19] sending over the four videos and the
[17:20] four audios. And because we aggregated
[17:22] them all together right here, it was
[17:24] super easy. I basically just went video
[17:26] one, video two, video three, video four.
[17:29] And then same thing with those audio
[17:30] files. And what this does is pretty much
[17:33] the exact same thing that that foul was
[17:35] doing when we made a request. It says,
[17:37] "Okay, cool. This is the template you
[17:39] want. Here are all the elements. Um, I'm
[17:41] going to work on that right now." So,
[17:42] here is my status. It's planned. It's
[17:44] processing. And if we go into create a
[17:47] mate and go to our API log, we can see
[17:49] that this one took 61.59 seconds. So, we
[17:52] go ahead and wait for 60 seconds. Looks
[17:53] like it just finished up in time. But
[17:55] keep in mind, we have this little
[17:57] polling method just in case it doesn't
[17:59] go through that it would come back and
[18:00] try again. But looks like it worked. So
[18:02] it went ahead and downloaded that video
[18:04] based on the URL that it provided us.
[18:06] And now we have the full video right
[18:07] here in our edit end. So let's take a
[18:09] quick look.
[18:11] [Music]
[18:33] Wow, that one turned out really cool. I
[18:34] liked the In and Out. There were cars
[18:36] moving by and there were like palm
[18:37] trees. You could tell it was like West
[18:38] Coast. Anyways, that is the final video
[18:41] and now we're moving on to this final
[18:42] step where we're actually just auto
[18:44] uploading everything and updating that
[18:47] Google sheet. So, the first thing we're
[18:49] doing is we're hitting that Google sheet
[18:51] and we're updating a row. So, we're
[18:53] linking back to that same sheet that we
[18:55] were looking at earlier. And when we're
[18:56] doing an update row operation in Nad, we
[18:59] basically have to tell Nadn which row to
[19:01] update. And we do that by mapping on a
[19:03] certain column. So, the column we're
[19:05] mapping on, the column we're matching on
[19:08] here is called category, which as you
[19:10] can see is like the first one over here.
[19:12] So, we're matching on category. And all
[19:13] I had to do was drag in the category
[19:15] that triggered this whole process all
[19:17] the way down here. So, now it sees
[19:19] whenever. So now it basically says,
[19:21] "Okay, I'm going to update the row
[19:22] called fast food chains." And for the
[19:24] actual updates I'm making, I'm just
[19:25] going to change the status to done and
[19:27] I'm going to upload that final URL. So
[19:29] if I come back in here, we can see fast
[19:30] food chains has been marked as done. And
[19:32] we now have this final URL, which is the
[19:37] video. Okay, cool. So now that we have
[19:40] that all figured out, we want to
[19:42] automatically upload to Instagram, Tik
[19:44] Tok, and YouTube. And the way we want to
[19:45] do that is through a platform called
[19:47] Blot, which I'll leave a link for in the
[19:49] description. You can also get 30% off if
[19:51] you use code Nate30 for 6 months. You
[19:54] get 30% off. So anyways, at a high
[19:56] level, how this works is we have a URL
[19:58] that points to our video, but in order
[20:00] to upload it through Blotato to
[20:02] Instagram, Tik Tok, and YouTube, we have
[20:04] to upload that URL to Blot and it's
[20:06] going to give us a potato URL. Same
[20:08] video, just a new URL, and then we can
[20:10] publish it. So that's what we're doing
[20:11] in this first HTTP request is we're
[20:13] accessing Blot's servers. We have
[20:16] ourselves credentialed, of course, with
[20:18] an API key. So, same thing. We're doing
[20:20] a header off blot- API- key and we have
[20:24] to get our API key from Botato. So, if
[20:26] you go into Blot and you come into your
[20:28] settings, you can basically see, okay,
[20:30] here's my account. Here are the nine
[20:31] different things I can log into and auto
[20:33] post to. And then down here, we have API
[20:35] access, copy API key. So, back in Nitn,
[20:38] you'd basically just, you know, paste
[20:39] your API key right in there. And now you
[20:41] have it saved to potato. And it's always
[20:43] just good to save your credentials. I
[20:44] didn't do it in the create a mate step,
[20:46] but it's always good to save them so
[20:47] when you need them later, you can use
[20:49] them easily. And you'll have to use
[20:50] these three credentials later for
[20:52] Instagram, Tik Tok, and YouTube. But
[20:54] anyways, what we're doing is sending
[20:55] over a JSON body. And it's just one
[20:57] thing. It's a field called URL. And
[20:59] we're just going to drag in that URL
[21:01] that we just got from Google Sheets and
[21:02] from Creatmate right here. And now, as
[21:04] you can see, it gives us back a URL,
[21:07] which is the exact same video. It's just
[21:09] now a blot database URL. Now, all we
[21:12] have to do is link to these three nodes,
[21:14] which are pretty much the same thing,
[21:15] just a few different configurations. So,
[21:17] let's take a quick look at the Instagram
[21:18] one first. So, we're making a post
[21:20] request to Blot to actually post
[21:23] something. We have our Blot header off
[21:25] in there once again. And now for the
[21:27] body, what we're doing is we're using
[21:29] this JSON, which is saying, okay, I want
[21:31] to post to Instagram. The text or the
[21:33] title of this post is going to be um the
[21:36] category reimagined. So, it's going to
[21:37] come through as fast food chains
[21:39] reimagined.
[21:40] What is the actual media URL? This is
[21:42] where we need that Bot URL in order for
[21:44] it to actually post it. And then
[21:46] finally, we need our Instagram account
[21:47] ID, which all you have to do is go to
[21:49] Bot. You'll sign into Instagram. And
[21:51] then right here, you can see my
[21:52] Instagram account. You'll click copy
[21:53] account ID. Come back and edit in. And
[21:56] then you'll just paste that account ID
[21:58] right there. And now you're good to post
[22:00] to Instagram. Tik Tok is pretty much the
[22:02] same thing, just a few differences.
[22:04] Everything up here is the same. The only
[22:05] difference is the actual JSON body. This
[22:07] one has a few different like settings
[22:08] you can tweak with. So is AI generated?
[22:10] I put that as true. But what we're doing
[22:12] here is text. So same exact thing. Fast
[22:14] food chains reimagined platform is Tik
[22:16] Tok and then the media URL once again.
[22:18] And then for our account ID, you'd log
[22:20] in with Tik Tok. You would come here,
[22:22] click copy account ID, and then you
[22:24] would just paste that right in there and
[22:27] you'd be good to go. Finally, with
[22:28] YouTube, like I said, all of this is the
[22:31] same, but then the JSON body is a little
[22:33] bit different. YouTube asks for a title
[22:35] and text, and I'm not exactly sure which
[22:37] one really is which. So, I put the exact
[22:38] same thing in both, which is fast food
[22:40] chains reimagined. I have this going to
[22:42] unlisted should notify subscribers
[22:44] false. And um same thing with the media
[22:47] URL. And then once again, of course,
[22:49] with the account ID, you'll log in with
[22:51] YouTube. Copy the account ID right
[22:53] there. And then you will just paste that
[22:55] right there and you'll be good to go.
[22:56] And then one thing with potato that I
[22:58] wanted to mention is when you come into
[22:59] your account, you can go over here to
[23:01] publish posts and then you can see
[23:03] exactly which ones have been posted and
[23:04] you can click on the links right here
[23:06] and it will take you to that post on
[23:07] your Instagram or your Tik Tok or
[23:09] Pinterest or LinkedIn, whatever you want
[23:10] to post to. But one thing I wanted to
[23:13] mention is if you go to failed posts,
[23:14] you can see some that have failed. And
[23:16] I've gotten a few errors with Tik Tok,
[23:17] which basically have said like the
[23:19] creator has made too many posts via
[23:21] OpenAI. So I was doing too much when I
[23:23] was testing. And then also I had gotten
[23:25] multiple errors with YouTube and I think
[23:26] this is just because it says, you know,
[23:28] I've exceeded my quota. So if you're
[23:30] seeing some errors or if you're not
[23:32] seeing posts pop up, you can go to your
[23:33] failed post section and you can see why
[23:35] those aren't working. Okay, so that's
[23:36] basically this entire workflow. As you
[23:38] can see, it's not too complicated and I
[23:40] really want you guys to download this
[23:42] workflow, test it out, play with the
[23:44] prompts, and customize it for, you know,
[23:46] creating your own unique type of shorts.
[23:48] But what we're going to do now is talk
[23:49] about how can you access all the
[23:51] resources, what resources actually are
[23:53] involved, and how can you set this up
[23:54] for yourself in under 10 minutes. So,
[23:57] first thing you need to do is go to my
[23:59] free school community. The link for that
[24:00] will be down in the description. And
[24:02] you're just going to click on YouTube
[24:03] resources or you can search for the
[24:05] title of this video right up here in the
[24:07] search bar. And when you find this post,
[24:09] so say this is the post associated with
[24:10] this video, you'll see a JSON file right
[24:13] here and you're going to download that.
[24:14] And once you download that JSON file,
[24:16] you can open up a new workflow in Naden.
[24:18] Come up here and click on import from
[24:20] file and paste in that JSON. And then
[24:22] this exact workflow will just pop up
[24:24] right there. And there'll also be a
[24:25] little setup guide right here which will
[24:27] have all the links you need and say like
[24:28] here's what you need to plug in. Get
[24:30] your API key from here. Plug it in
[24:31] there. And it'll be pretty simple. But
[24:34] I'm also going to just kind of walk
[24:35] through that real quick in this video.
[24:37] So I'm just going to go kind of
[24:38] chronologically through the workflow and
[24:40] tell you what you need to set up. So the
[24:42] first thing would be the schedule
[24:43] trigger. How often do you want this to
[24:44] run? The second thing is the Google
[24:46] sheet. So, you need to get this template
[24:49] which I will have also in that school
[24:50] post. You know, you'll have the
[24:52] template, you'll have a create a mate
[24:53] file, all this kind of stuff. This is
[24:55] the template you'll have and you'll need
[24:56] to come in here and make a copy of it.
[24:57] So, a file, make a copy, and then it
[24:59] will be in your own Google suite. And
[25:01] then you'll just have to come in here
[25:02] and make sure that you actually choose
[25:03] the right sheet and link it to your own
[25:05] Google environment. Otherwise, it's
[25:07] going to be trying to access a sheet
[25:08] that you don't have access to and stuff
[25:10] like that. So, set up that. You're also
[25:12] going to have to set this sheet up right
[25:14] over here, by the way. So, pretty much
[25:15] the exact same thing. But then, moving
[25:17] along, the next thing you have to do is
[25:18] connect some sort of chat model. So,
[25:20] we're using Open Router, and I'm using
[25:22] GPT4.1. If you don't want to use Open
[25:24] Router, you don't have to, but you'll
[25:25] have to connect a different one. And if
[25:27] you're doing Open Router, all you have
[25:28] to do is go to Open Router, connect your
[25:30] API key in here, set up your Open Router
[25:33] account, and then you'll be good to go.
[25:35] Okay. Next thing you're going to have to
[25:36] do is set up your file credential for
[25:38] all six of these nodes. And if you do it
[25:40] once, it's so much easier for the rest
[25:41] of them. We kind of talked about this
[25:43] earlier, but you're going to go to file.
[25:44] You're going to grab your API key.
[25:46] You're going to come into here, and
[25:47] you're going to add a new header off,
[25:48] and it's going to be authorization. The
[25:50] value is going to be key space your file
[25:53] API key. So, you'll paste that all in
[25:54] there. And then you'll have this file
[25:56] credential saved as a header off, which
[25:57] you can then link in this node, this
[25:59] node, this node, this node, and this
[26:01] node. Then you're going to have to go
[26:02] get your 11 Labs API key. So, you'll go
[26:04] to 11 Labs. Like I said, all the links
[26:06] will be over here in the setup guide,
[26:07] but you'll go to 11 Labs and get your
[26:08] API key. And then you're going to make
[26:10] it a new header off XI- API- key. And
[26:13] then you'll paste in that 11 Labs API
[26:15] key right there. Okay. Then we get to
[26:18] create a mate down here. So the first
[26:20] thing that you need to do is when you're
[26:21] in that school post right here, you'll
[26:23] see like a PDF and it will look like
[26:25] this. So this is the source code that
[26:27] you need for Creatmate. So let's say you
[26:30] come in here and you copy this source
[26:31] code. You go to create a mate and you go
[26:33] to templates and let's just say that
[26:35] you, you know, open up a new blank
[26:36] template and there's nothing in here and
[26:38] you'll come up here and click on the
[26:39] source editor. You'll then just
[26:41] basically paste in that source code that
[26:42] I gave you and you'll have this template
[26:44] where you have a 20 second long video
[26:46] with four audio files and four video
[26:48] files. And then the easiest way to set
[26:50] this up for you would be to click on use
[26:52] template API integration and copy your
[26:54] template ID right here. go back into
[26:57] edit in and then when you open up this
[26:59] node that's already there, just replace
[27:00] the template ID with the one that you
[27:03] got from your own creatate and then all
[27:06] you need to do is replace my API key
[27:07] right here with your API key. So you'll
[27:10] go back into creatate, you'll come out
[27:11] here and go to project settings and you
[27:13] can click copy or you can click to
[27:15] reveal your API key and then copy it and
[27:17] then you'll just replace it, you know,
[27:19] right in there. Cool. And then the last
[27:22] thing you're going to have to do is
[27:22] blot. So, you'll click on the link in
[27:25] the description or over here to go to
[27:26] Botato. You can sign up and get 30% off
[27:29] using code Nate30 for six months and
[27:31] then you'll go get your API key from
[27:32] Botato. You'll save that as a header off
[27:35] where you'll do
[27:36] potato-i- put in your API key. Then
[27:38] you're pretty much good to go. The last
[27:40] part would just be in Botato. If you go
[27:41] to your settings, choose which ones you
[27:43] want to post to, and then once you log
[27:45] in, you'll have to link all of your own
[27:46] account IDs, you know, in those
[27:48] individual requests like I kind of
[27:49] talked about earlier. But that's going
[27:51] to be basically it. That should all take
[27:53] you less than 10 minutes. And then you
[27:54] can start filling in that Google sheet
[27:56] template with with categories and bam,
[27:58] you're going to be auto posting to
[28:00] different socials on autopilot. The
[28:03] final thing I wanted to talk about here
[28:04] was the actual cost breakdown of running
[28:07] the system. So there's a couple
[28:10] different elements here. The first one
[28:11] would be the chat model. So we're using
[28:13] OpenAI through Open Router GBT4.1 and
[28:16] it's super cheap. I mean um in the grand
[28:18] scheme of things, it's less than a cent
[28:19] per run. So that's not really even an
[28:20] issue. Now, the video generation in this
[28:24] template is definitely a little more on
[28:25] the pricier side compared to some other
[28:27] workflows that we've done. Um, but I
[28:29] think that that's the, you know,
[28:31] trade-off you make. This is really,
[28:32] really high quality stuff. So, first of
[28:34] all, image generation. We're using Flux
[28:36] Pro through FAL. This is going to be 6
[28:38] cents per image. So, four images per
[28:40] run. So, 24 cents per run. You could
[28:44] always go down to different image
[28:45] generators like a lower flux dev would
[28:47] be like one and a half cents per image.
[28:49] You could try that or you could scale up
[28:51] if you want. Anyways, then for video
[28:53] generation, same thing. You could scale
[28:54] down or scale up. I really like the way
[28:56] that these outputs were were coming out.
[28:58] So, with Clingv 1.6 Pro, it's going to
[29:01] be 46ish cents for a 5second video. So,
[29:04] it's a little less than $2 per run per
[29:07] short just for the video generation
[29:09] aspect. And then we have some weirder
[29:11] ones because they're more of a monthly,
[29:12] not a pay as you go model. So, we've got
[29:14] sound effects from 11 Labs, which if you
[29:15] do a $5 a month starter plan from 11
[29:17] Labs, that really should be more than
[29:19] enough. I've never really gone over
[29:21] that. Then we have Creatmate, which will
[29:22] be, you know, you have a free trial, so
[29:24] you can play around for a bit, but then
[29:25] on top of that, it'll be 41 bucks a
[29:27] month, which will give you 2,000
[29:28] credits. So, real quick, if I go into
[29:30] Creatimate and look at our runs, we can
[29:32] see each of these videos is taking
[29:34] around 12.5 credits. So, this math isn't
[29:37] perfect, but that should get you around
[29:39] 200 runs for the month. And then of
[29:41] course an optional one is Botato which
[29:43] is going to be 30 bucks. Unless you do
[29:45] code Nate30 you can get 30% off. Um and
[29:47] this is going to help you automatically
[29:48] post to those three socials but also
[29:50] there's six other socials that you can
[29:51] automatically post to. Cost per run
[29:54] roughly is going to be a little over two
[29:55] bucks if you're taking into account the
[29:57] image and the video generation. That
[29:59] should be cling with an with a K. Um,
[30:03] and then we have these other optional
[30:04] sort of monthly subscriptions which, you
[30:06] know, you kind of do need the sound
[30:07] effects and the creatate, but these are
[30:09] what the costs look like for that. All
[30:11] right, so that's basically the whole
[30:13] breakdown. Hopefully, this is cool to
[30:14] see that it's not even that complicated.
[30:16] The only really complications were doing
[30:18] this polling with multiple items running
[30:19] through and maybe setting up the
[30:21] Creative Mate template. But luckily, I
[30:23] have this template for you. So, all of
[30:24] that is good to go. All you have to do
[30:26] is plug and play and play with some
[30:27] prompts. So, if you enjoyed this video
[30:29] and you learned something new or you
[30:31] enjoy this style of teaching and this
[30:32] style of video, definitely give this
[30:33] video a like. It helps me out a ton. And
[30:35] also definitely consider checking out
[30:36] the paid community. The link for that's
[30:38] also down in the description. We've got
[30:40] a little over 1.8,000 members in here
[30:42] who are all building every day with
[30:43] Naden and learning AI automations. It's
[30:45] really cool to be in a community where
[30:46] everyone is as obsessed with this kind
[30:48] of stuff as you are. So, it's really
[30:49] helpful to be in there. We've also got
[30:51] two main courses. One's called Agent
[30:53] Zero, the foundations of like LLMs and
[30:55] vector databases and stuff. And then the
[30:57] second one is called 10 hours and 10
[30:59] seconds where you learn how to identify,
[31:01] design, and build time-saving
[31:02] automations. On top of that, we also do
[31:04] five live calls per week where I'm in
[31:06] there and we do guest speakers, we do
[31:08] Q&As's, we do coffee chats and tech
[31:10] support as well. So you can always get
[31:12] questions answered and you can also make
[31:13] sure you're connecting with other people
[31:14] in the space. But anyways, that's going
[31:16] to be it for this video. Really
[31:17] appreciate you guys making it to the end
[31:19] as always and I'll see you in the next
[31:21] one. Thanks everyone.
