[00:00] hey guys today we're going to be going
[00:01] over this framework that's going to help
[00:02] you create different AI agents in order
[00:04] to automate your inbox in this workflow
[00:06] that we're going to be walking through
[00:07] step byep today it starts by watching
[00:09] for your emails and then it evaluates
[00:10] them to see if they're customer support
[00:12] related or not if they are it's going to
[00:13] hit the customer support agent that has
[00:16] access to your internal policies your
[00:17] FAQ stuff like that so that it can craft
[00:19] you an accurate draft in that same
[00:21] thread of the original email and then
[00:23] you can go in there and approve it
[00:25] before you send it off and finally it's
[00:27] going to notify you on slack or telegram
[00:29] whatever you want it to be and it's just
[00:30] going to say hey we got this email this
[00:32] is what it's talking about we created a
[00:33] draft if you want to go in there check
[00:35] it out and then send it let's do a quick
[00:37] demo see this thing in action we'll hit
[00:38] test workflow we will see that the Gmail
[00:40] trigger pulls in an email we're now
[00:41] checking if it's customer support it is
[00:43] so it's hitting the agent the agent's
[00:44] looking in our Vector database for
[00:46] information on the policies um it's
[00:48] creating an email right now it just hit
[00:49] it the Gmail tool it made a draft and as
[00:51] you can see we just got a message back
[00:53] in telegram so we got a little summary
[00:54] about what just happened and then if we
[00:56] go into our email we can see that we got
[00:58] this email and then we also have a draft
[01:00] which was you know replying to this
[01:02] email and it has information about what
[01:04] the customer asked about so um that's
[01:06] how this workflow works and you know
[01:08] let's not waste any time and hop
[01:09] straight into the step-by-step tutorial
[01:11] okay here we are within NN as always the
[01:13] first step when you're creating a
[01:14] workflow is to set up the trigger so in
[01:17] here we have the options of we can
[01:18] trigger this this workflow manually we
[01:20] can do it on an app event we can
[01:21] schedule it but here what we're going to
[01:23] do is actually none of these we're going
[01:25] to do a trigger of Gmail so what we want
[01:27] to do is when a email comes through
[01:29] that's when this workflow is going to
[01:31] execute and the agent's going to look at
[01:32] the EML and understand if it's for
[01:34] customer support or not customer support
[01:36] So as always the first thing you need to
[01:38] do is set up your credentials so I
[01:39] already have mine connected here but you
[01:40] need to create a new credential you need
[01:42] to sign in with Google and if you don't
[01:43] understand how to set up your o consent
[01:45] screen and all that you can go into the
[01:46] N end docs super simple or I also made a
[01:48] video about it which I will tag right up
[01:50] here so anyways once we have that
[01:52] connected we need to set up how this is
[01:54] going to work so as you can see our
[01:55] event is on message received that's
[01:57] what's going to trigger this workflow
[01:59] and then we also have a couple other
[02:01] options here which we can simplify or
[02:02] not simplify the um email coming back so
[02:05] let me show you what the difference is
[02:06] there I'm going to come up here and hit
[02:08] fetch test event this is going to pull
[02:09] the most recent email that we got and as
[02:11] you can see we got a snippet which is
[02:13] hey I was wondering how I can track my
[02:14] order also what is your refund policy
[02:16] Thanks James and in this case it's fine
[02:18] as you can see we didn't get a ton of
[02:19] information back this information just
[02:21] got simplified um and like I said in
[02:23] this case it's fine but we're going to
[02:24] turn it off because if you had a longer
[02:26] email the email would get cut off short
[02:28] so now you can see we have a lot more
[02:29] information coming back um it may be a
[02:31] little more confusing to look at but
[02:32] it's important so the agent is going to
[02:35] be able to get full context of the email
[02:37] that is coming through also one quick
[02:39] tip we just trigger this this um email
[02:41] trigger and we want to be able to play
[02:43] with this data for the rest of the
[02:44] workflow while we're testing so if you
[02:46] come up to the top right and hit pin
[02:47] data this data is now pinned once we
[02:49] refresh everything we don't have to
[02:50] reload this trigger we're just going to
[02:52] have this email to play with for the
[02:54] rest of our workflow so fun tip from
[02:57] here we just want to grab a set field so
[02:58] we can clean up some of the data that's
[02:59] coming through through make it easier to
[03:00] look at and also make it easier to
[03:02] reference so I'm going to grab a set
[03:03] field we can just call this
[03:06] um set content that's going to be good
[03:08] enough for us to understand what we're
[03:09] looking at and the first thing that we
[03:10] want to set is the email body so we will
[03:15] have that be the subject and then we're
[03:16] going to scroll down to try to find the
[03:17] actual content that's coming through in
[03:19] the email right here we have um HTML we
[03:22] have textas HTML but we're looking for
[03:24] the actual text which is right here so
[03:25] we're going to grab this field drag that
[03:27] into the value section and now we have
[03:29] json. text but what's actually coming
[03:31] through as json. text is the email so
[03:33] hey I was wondering how I can track my
[03:34] order also what's your refund policy
[03:36] Thanks James so now we have the email
[03:38] coming through you could also go through
[03:40] here and if you wanted to you can set
[03:41] other fields like the subject um like
[03:43] the ID like um you know the the the who
[03:47] it's from that kind of thing but
[03:49] actually what I'm going to do is I want
[03:50] to set the thread ID so we're going to
[03:52] grab the thread ID and this is going to
[03:54] be important so later when we want to
[03:55] create that draft and we want to
[03:57] associate it with this email that's
[03:58] coming through we can plug in this
[04:00] thread ID so that it knows what to
[04:01] respond to so in thread ID we're just
[04:03] going to drag in right there thread ID
[04:05] and this isn't necessary we could always
[04:06] reference it later from the Gmail
[04:08] trigger but sometimes it's easier just
[04:09] to have some information set and that
[04:11] way you know where it is so we'll
[04:13] actually just go ahead and test the step
[04:14] real quick so we can see that what comes
[04:15] through is the email body as well as the
[04:17] thread ID real quick I wanted to
[04:18] introduce you guys to a super cool
[04:20] platform called Mind Studio it's an
[04:21] integrated development environment to
[04:23] develop AI features and workflows
[04:24] without coding making it accessible to
[04:26] developers and non-technical users alike
[04:29] with mind Studio Studio you can access
[04:30] over 50 AI models across text image
[04:32] audio generation and soon even video
[04:35] it's not just about having access to
[04:36] models it's about flexibility that mind
[04:38] Studio can autogenerate workflows using
[04:40] AI train on your data sources scrape the
[04:42] web and execute JavaScript or python
[04:44] code you can mix and match these models
[04:46] to find the perfect balance between cost
[04:48] and performance and you can even deploy
[04:50] AI workers as apps or apis and integrate
[04:52] them with tools like zapier make or
[04:54] virtually any platform that supports
[04:55] HTTP requests if you're intrigued join
[04:58] the free introduct webinar to learn how
[05:00] mind Studio can bring your ideas to life
[05:02] sign up now at the link below in the
[05:04] description got the email we've got the
[05:05] content set now what we want to do is we
[05:07] want to add a large language model to be
[05:09] able to look at the email content and
[05:10] determine if it's customer support
[05:12] related or not so we're going to come
[05:13] into here we're going to add a open AI
[05:16] node we're going to grab a message model
[05:18] node which is oh I passed it right here
[05:21] and now from here you need to just
[05:23] obviously connect your credential we
[05:25] need to choose the type of model so I'm
[05:27] going to go with a 40 mini in this case
[05:29] and then we're going to set the system
[05:30] prompts right here which is going to be
[05:32] let me pull this up in expression mode
[05:34] we're saying prompt analyze the content
[05:36] of the email and determine whether it's
[05:38] related to customer support if the email
[05:40] pertains to any of the following topics
[05:41] Mark customer support is true otherwise
[05:43] Mark is false so we wanted to Output a
[05:45] field called customer support with
[05:47] either true or false and then we just
[05:48] gave it some topics that would be
[05:50] customer support like order status um
[05:53] issues with with damag products returns
[05:55] refunds subscriptions all that kind of
[05:57] stuff and then we just told it to Output
[05:59] the following following um in a Json
[06:01] format Json format with a field called
[06:03] customer support and said it is true or
[06:05] false so we've got that um that's our
[06:07] system prompt this is telling this node
[06:09] how to act now we want to add a user
[06:11] which is just going to be um we're
[06:13] dragging in the email body but first
[06:14] before we do that we want to say here is
[06:17] the incoming email add a little colon in
[06:20] the space and then we'll drag in the
[06:21] incoming email so now it's going to be
[06:23] looking at that email we're going to
[06:24] Output the content as Json so it
[06:26] actually comes out in a field called
[06:28] customer support and we'll hit test step
[06:30] see if it worked so in this case
[06:32] customer support came back true um why
[06:34] we wanted to Output it as Json because
[06:36] if we didn't do this I will just show
[06:37] you real quick it's going to Output as
[06:39] content and then customer support true
[06:41] so it's doing what we want it to but we
[06:43] want the field to actually be called
[06:44] customer support so that we can call it
[06:46] in later so that's why we want to Output
[06:48] it as is Json I'm just going to come in
[06:50] here and call
[06:51] this customer
[06:53] support eval um so now this node is just
[06:57] evaluating if um this this email is
[07:00] customer support related or not all
[07:02] right now that we have that saying true
[07:03] or false what we're going to do in here
[07:05] is grab a switch node so we want two
[07:07] different things to take place if
[07:09] customer support is true then it's going
[07:11] to go off and it's going to create that
[07:12] draft for us in response to that email
[07:15] and if it's false then we want it to go
[07:17] down a different path which will either
[07:18] notify us that we got an email that's
[07:20] not customer support related or you know
[07:22] any other logic so first let's just set
[07:24] up this switch so we're just going to
[07:27] say oops customer support that's what's
[07:30] going on within this node um the first
[07:32] value is going to be um we're saying is
[07:35] customer support right here is this and
[07:38] this is a Boolean as you can see it's
[07:39] not a string so over here the letter a
[07:42] means that this field is a string um
[07:45] this block means that content is an
[07:46] object this little hashtag or what's it
[07:49] called a pound sign shows that index is
[07:51] a digit field or a number field and then
[07:54] finally this check mark just shows that
[07:56] um customer support is a Boolean so
[07:57] we're going to go to Boolean and we're
[07:58] going to say it's true
[08:00] so if this is true um we're going to
[08:02] rename this output and call it Customer
[08:05] Support I'm going to type that a lot in
[08:07] this video and then anyways we're going
[08:08] to we're going to dve drag another one
[08:10] it's going to be Boolean is false and
[08:12] this output is going to be not
[08:17] customer support okay so we'll hit test
[08:20] step we can see because customer support
[08:23] is true it's going to come out the
[08:24] branch of customer support so that's
[08:27] what's going on right here so let's
[08:28] continue down the path of assuming that
[08:30] this is a customer support email we'll
[08:31] drag some logic out this way and in this
[08:33] case what we want to do is now we're
[08:35] going to add our AI agent so in here we
[08:38] are going to call this guy the customer
[08:42] support agent okay so we have a customer
[08:44] support agent this is going to be a we
[08:48] could do a conversational because we
[08:49] want it to um you know respond with very
[08:53] human-like ANW so actually we'll try
[08:55] conversational we're not going to take
[08:57] from previous note automatically we're
[08:58] going to Define below and the text that
[09:00] we're getting is going to be we're
[09:01] feeding it in the original customer
[09:03] support email that's coming through so
[09:05] we're going to go back to the set
[09:06] content node and we're going to drag in
[09:07] the email body this is what we want this
[09:09] customer support agent to look at
[09:11] evaluate grab our information in order
[09:14] to respond to it accurately and then
[09:15] respond to it accurately so um from here
[09:20] we will need to add a system prompt so
[09:21] we'll add this in for now but we will
[09:23] obviously change this up what we want to
[09:25] do next is we want to obviously give the
[09:27] agent a brain so I'm going to come in
[09:29] here and give it for mini um we're going
[09:32] to leave the memory as blank for now but
[09:33] what we want to do is add a tool so we
[09:35] need to give the agent understanding of
[09:38] customer support policies and guidelines
[09:39] for our company so I'm going to grab a
[09:42] vector store tool we're going to call
[09:44] this one customer support docs we're
[09:49] saying that this tool retrieves data
[09:53] about our or no not data we'll do
[09:55] retrieves
[09:56] information about our customer
[10:00] support
[10:02] policies um and
[10:06] faq's okay so Vector store tool we need
[10:09] to connect our model to this as well
[10:11] we'll leave this one as for mini we need
[10:13] to add the vector store which is going
[10:14] to be pine cone um we're adding our
[10:16] index which is sample our name space
[10:18] which will be
[10:20] called customer support and we haven't
[10:22] done this we'll do this in a sec but
[10:24] that's what we're going to be loading it
[10:25] into and then finally we need to choose
[10:27] the actual embedding for our agent or
[10:28] for our Factor store which we're going
[10:30] to do embedding three small so we have
[10:32] this configured um now what we're going
[10:35] to do next is actually add our document
[10:37] to our Pine con Vector store so here's
[10:39] the customer support document that I
[10:40] have right here um customer support
[10:42] policies and FAQs we've got policies
[10:43] FAQs of course this was just generated
[10:45] for me by chat gbt so anyways we have
[10:48] this document we're going to load it
[10:50] into um our pine cone so I have this one
[10:54] already in here as pulling customer
[10:56] support policies and FAQs we'll hit test
[10:58] workflow
[10:59] um we're downloading the file here as
[11:00] binary we're uploading it to Pine Cone
[11:02] we have everything set up in here so
[11:03] that it should be splitting out
[11:04] correctly so now we have all this
[11:06] information within that document
[11:07] embedded up into four different um
[11:10] vectors and then put into our uh what's
[11:12] it called our pine cone and as you can
[11:14] see we're loading it into a namespace
[11:16] called customer support So now back in
[11:18] this agent tool that's why we referenced
[11:20] right here it's look not right here
[11:22] right here it's looking for a namespace
[11:24] called customer support so it should be
[11:25] able to grab accurate information for us
[11:27] real quick guys I just wanted to say if
[11:28] you want to download these templates
[11:30] that are shown in this video go to my
[11:31] fre School Community Linked In the
[11:32] description you'll go to YouTube
[11:34] resources click on the post associated
[11:36] with this video and then you'll have the
[11:37] workflow right here to download also if
[11:39] you're looking to take your nadn and
[11:40] your a automation skills a little deeper
[11:42] check out my paid Community we've got a
[11:43] great classroom that goes over Deep dive
[11:45] topics real project insights with client
[11:47] builds we've got a great community and
[11:49] we've also got um live calls we're doing
[11:50] about five a week right now so hop in
[11:52] here I'd love to see you guys finally if
[11:54] you're looking for me to help you build
[11:55] out this sort of stuff within your
[11:56] business or you're looking for some AI
[11:57] Consulting then book in a call using the
[11:59] link from my website down below and
[12:01] let's talk so in here what we're doing
[12:03] is um the resource is going to be a
[12:05] draft the operation is obviously that
[12:06] we're creating a draft um and now we
[12:09] just need to set up the subject the the
[12:11] text of the email the message and then
[12:14] any other properties which we want to do
[12:16] a thread ID so um first things first we
[12:19] need to configure this node we're going
[12:22] to call this
[12:23] one create draft and we need to set up
[12:27] the subject and the message so what
[12:28] we're going to do is use that super cool
[12:29] from AI expression so we're going to
[12:31] change the subject to an expression
[12:33] we're going to come in here grab two
[12:34] curly braces and we're going to type in
[12:36] dollar sign from we'll grab from Ai and
[12:39] then in the key in quotes we're going to
[12:41] say subject and so this is going to um
[12:44] the agent's going to understand okay I
[12:46] have this email that I just got I'm
[12:48] going to hit the vector database to get
[12:49] information to answer the email and then
[12:51] I'm going to make an email and then I
[12:53] know that here needs to go a subject and
[12:55] then down here needs to go a message so
[12:56] it's just a really cool way to give your
[12:58] agents so was much quicker if you want
[13:00] to see a video about it I made one I'll
[13:01] tag it up here but I kind of go in depth
[13:03] a little more on how these functions
[13:04] work and the value in them anyways down
[13:06] here in quotes we're going to put
[13:08] actually we're going to put email body
[13:11] Okay so we've got that and then finally
[13:13] we need to reference the thread ID so
[13:15] this is also going to be an expression
[13:16] and we need to pull this dynamically
[13:18] from the email that we got in the first
[13:20] place so if you remember we set that
[13:21] earlier with set content so we're going
[13:22] to grab set content we're going to type
[13:24] a do item Json and then finally thread
[13:28] ID so now this is dynamically pulling in
[13:30] the thread ID that's associated with the
[13:32] email that triggered this workflow in
[13:33] the first place and I think we should be
[13:36] good to go here with um this node so
[13:39] we've got our Vector store tool we have
[13:41] our create draft tool and now we just
[13:42] need to make sure that this agent has a
[13:43] prompt so I went ahead and grabbed one
[13:45] already we're going to change this to an
[13:47] expression we're going to open this up
[13:49] and we're going to delete this and paste
[13:51] in this prompt so basically what I said
[13:52] in here was you're highly skilled and
[13:54] empathetic customer support agent
[13:56] specializing in drafting professional
[13:58] and helpful response to incoming emails
[14:01] your tasks are to take the email use the
[14:02] customer support docs tool to look up
[14:04] relevant policies create a draft using
[14:06] the create draft tool and then after
[14:07] drafting the email provide a concise
[14:09] summary of the email content as the
[14:11] output and then I went through specifics
[14:14] context some examples and all that
[14:16] boring stuff um but anyways let's see
[14:19] how see what happens so we're going to
[14:21] test this step we obviously are hoping
[14:23] that um the selected tools are not
[14:26] supported by conversational agent okay
[14:28] well anyways we'll change this to a
[14:30] tools agent and see what happens let me
[14:31] just copy again this prompt because when
[14:33] you change this it's going to um get
[14:36] ready your prompt
[14:38] so we'll grab that in there and let's
[14:41] see did that okay now we'll test the
[14:43] step so it's reading the email it's
[14:45] going to understand to hit the vector
[14:46] store tool to get that policy
[14:47] information now it is going to go back
[14:50] it's going to hit the create draft tool
[14:51] and then create that draft for us so all
[14:53] that finished up let's just see the
[14:55] output that we got which was uh a quick
[14:58] summary of the email which is perfect in
[15:00] the
[15:00] draft we can see that the um subject was
[15:04] order tracking and refund policy the
[15:06] message was dear James thank you for
[15:08] reaching out to track your order you can
[15:10] log in blah blah blah regarding our
[15:12] refund policy digital products are
[15:13] non-refundable blah blah blah and then
[15:15] best regards Kelly customer support ABC
[15:17] Corp so if we were to check in here we
[15:19] would see that um it answered correctly
[15:22] I don't really want to actually yeah
[15:24] sure let's go through it okay what was
[15:26] the first thing we asked um it said to
[15:28] track your order you can lo into the
[15:29] account so let's look at how you track
[15:30] your
[15:32] order track order you can log in your
[15:34] account and visit the order history
[15:36] section or you can use a tracking link
[15:37] okay perfect um and then for refund
[15:40] policy digital products are
[15:41] non-refundable let's look at
[15:43] digital digital products are
[15:45] non-refundable unless there's a
[15:47] technical issue okay so it got the
[15:48] information right
[15:50] perfect and we can go into our Gmail and
[15:53] see if it actually created a draft for
[15:54] us right here we created a draft and
[15:57] it's in response to that earlier email
[15:58] that we sent so now if we like it we can
[16:00] hit send please specify at least one
[16:03] recipient okay so we would have to
[16:04] configure the two which is interesting
[16:07] um is that not something that ah two
[16:10] email okay interesting so what we're
[16:12] going to do is now we're going to grab
[16:13] the two email so that's actually
[16:14] something that you know you learn
[16:15] something new every day so for two email
[16:17] we want to grab that from the Gmail
[16:18] trigger um we're going to be looking at
[16:22] item. Json Dot
[16:26] from Dot
[16:30] value um this is me pretty much just
[16:32] guessing okay actually let's let's do
[16:34] this the easier way okay what we're
[16:36] going to do instead is we're going to
[16:39] set the content over here the two email
[16:40] as well so this is just going to be who
[16:42] it's from and then what we want to do is
[16:44] we want to go all the way down to see
[16:46] who the EML is from right here it's from
[16:47] NK 88 and now we've got that information
[16:50] we'll test this step we have that going
[16:51] through we're going to do this whole
[16:52] process again customer support it is
[16:55] indeed customer support and then right
[16:57] here we want to fill in who this is
[16:59] actually going back to we want to grab
[17:02] um from the set content we're grabbing
[17:04] item. json. from okay so sorry about
[17:09] that now we have the two and the thread
[17:10] ID and all this information so let's try
[17:12] that one more
[17:14] time it's going to do the same exact
[17:16] thing it's going to answer pretty much
[17:17] the same exact way it's going to create
[17:18] that draft for us
[17:21] um so it just created the draft now we
[17:23] got the output and now if we come into
[17:25] here we'll go back into our drafts we
[17:27] can see we have um actually where is
[17:31] it there we go so there's the new one
[17:33] dear James and then it actually has the
[17:35] email which we could send off so you
[17:36] would pretty much just be able to check
[17:38] if you like the way that it looks if not
[17:39] you can make a quick change and then you
[17:40] can send it off so um that's that now
[17:43] what's next so two other things that we
[17:46] want to do here first one is we want to
[17:47] add an option out here which is going to
[17:50] be um let's just do telegram so what
[17:52] we're going to do is we want to just
[17:54] basically be notified that okay we got
[17:57] this email and then we were able to to
[17:58] respond to it automatically so in
[18:00] telegram what we want to do is send a
[18:03] text message I can never find it there
[18:05] it is and um we to connect to your
[18:07] account and then we want to be sending a
[18:09] message obviously we're going to have to
[18:10] configure our text ID and our sorry our
[18:12] chat ID and our text so real quick let
[18:15] me show off a how you get your chat ID
[18:18] in telegram so if you go to the trigger
[18:20] we'll do on message okay so I'll hit
[18:23] test step in telegram I will bring in my
[18:25] telegram trigger and just say hi
[18:29] and now we can come through in here and
[18:31] we can see the chat ID so we got our
[18:32] chat ID right here I'm now going to
[18:36] paste that into our chat ID field and
[18:38] now we're good to go with this um we can
[18:41] get rid of this trigger and then finally
[18:42] what we need is we need the response
[18:45] from our agent so this is going to be an
[18:48] expression it's going to be json. output
[18:51] because that's what's coming out from
[18:52] the agent and then finally we're just
[18:54] going to turn off the append andent
[18:55] attribution we'll just call this
[18:58] response
[18:59] okay so now once that happens and the
[19:01] agent responds to a customer support
[19:03] email it's going to let us know that
[19:04] that happened and we can configure that
[19:05] later and say like okay we got an email
[19:07] from blank and it said blank and we sent
[19:11] it at this time but for now we'll keep
[19:12] it simple okay now to set up what
[19:14] happens if we get an email that's not
[19:15] Customer Support I'm going to copy this
[19:17] telegram we're going to paste it down
[19:18] here and we're going to configure this
[19:20] so the chat ID is going to be the same
[19:22] the text is not we're going to say you
[19:25] received an email at um we can do ass
[19:28] sign now. format so we've got the that
[19:33] information we can do um minute minute
[19:37] okay so at 429 um on you know we can
[19:40] change this too so let's say we just
[19:42] wanted to do
[19:45] um actually no we'll just do time so you
[19:47] just received an email at 4:30
[19:53] um
[19:55] saying and then we can grab the actual
[19:58] content of the email so we'll do the
[19:59] same thing set
[20:01] content. item
[20:03] do Json dot I don't know it just hasn't
[20:07] been executed so what do we set that as
[20:09] um email body is that what it was uh
[20:13] let's
[20:14] see emo body okay so that should work
[20:17] now
[20:18] um go ahead and save that and so this is
[20:20] pretty much where we're at so let's real
[20:23] quick let me send off an email that's
[20:24] not customer support related and we'll
[20:26] see what the response is okay so yeah
[20:28] thank you for meeting last week
[20:29] discussing our quarter for marketing
[20:31] strategy I'm pretty sure this should be
[20:33] evaluated as not customer support so
[20:35] we'll run this through we'll see there
[20:37] we go not customer support and then if
[20:39] we hit this we got the telegram
[20:40] notification of we received an email at
[20:42] 432 saying dear Alex blah blah blah so
[20:45] this obviously needs to be formatted
[20:46] differently um we would just come in
[20:48] here and we would change the way that
[20:49] this is coming through but this is just
[20:51] to show you you know what you can do as
[20:53] far as how you can set up different
[20:54] logic so maybe we'd set it up like that
[20:57] put a colon right here and then we get
[20:58] this answer
[20:59] instead um so that's you know if it's
[21:02] not customer support it'll go this way
[21:03] if it is customer support it'll go this
[21:05] way create a draft and then it will
[21:06] actually send you response so what we
[21:08] should do real quick is let's make this
[21:09] workflow active got it and let me fire
[21:13] off an email and then we will see um you
[21:15] know the live execution of this
[21:16] happening without us having to test
[21:18] anything okay so I pretty much just sent
[21:20] off an email um I've got my telegram
[21:21] pulled up the workflow is active we will
[21:24] be watching to see when this happens as
[21:26] far as when the draft gets created and
[21:28] when telegram message comes back okay so
[21:30] I just got that telegram message back it
[21:32] said that it drafted an email response
[21:33] addressing David's concerns about a
[21:35] defected product um the response
[21:37] includes instructions on how to report
[21:38] the defect it gives us a summary where
[21:40] David informs about blah blah blah and
[21:42] wants to speak to a live rep so we got
[21:44] that message and now we can go into our
[21:46] email if we go to the thread we will see
[21:49] that there's a draft created right here
[21:50] for us it has a two field already and it
[21:52] pretty much tells him how to handle
[21:55] talking to a live rep and what what he
[21:56] should do with his defective product so
[21:57] we can prove that we like it we'll send
[21:59] it off and um yeah that's going to be
[22:01] how that works if we go into here we can
[22:03] see this was the live execution that
[22:05] just took place because the workflow was
[22:07] active now and it went through the
[22:09] branch of customer support it went
[22:11] through the agent it hit the vector
[22:12] database it hit the draft and then it
[22:15] finally sent us that telegram message so
[22:17] that's going to be it for this one I
[22:18] know that it was a a pretty simple
[22:19] walkthrough of a build it uses some
[22:22] conditional logic it uses an agent and
[22:24] um aspects of rag as well as creating a
[22:26] draft using an email tool and if you
[22:28] guys guys appreciated this one I would
[22:29] really appreciate if you could drop a
[22:31] like it really helps me out subscribe
[22:32] for more NAD and AI agent tutorials and
[22:35] I will see you guys in the next one
[22:36] thanks
