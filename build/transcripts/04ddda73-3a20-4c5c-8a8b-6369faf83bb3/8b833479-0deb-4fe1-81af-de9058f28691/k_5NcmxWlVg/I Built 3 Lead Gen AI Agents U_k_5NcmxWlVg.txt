[00:00] Today I'm going to be building a lead
[00:01] generation and outreach system right
[00:03] here in front of you guys just using my
[00:04] natural words. So let's get started.
[00:07] This interface right here is what's
[00:08] prompting me to use natural language in
[00:10] order to explain what kind of agent I
[00:12] want to build. So I'm just going to
[00:14] paste in this request that says build an
[00:16] agent that generates leads for me. It
[00:18] will find the name, role, company,
[00:20] company size, and email address of
[00:22] people based on my request of industry
[00:24] and location. It's also going to store
[00:26] all the results in a Google sheet. So
[00:27] I'm going to send this off. And what's
[00:29] going to happen is the agent is going to
[00:30] look at this request and it's going to
[00:32] start to figure out how to build this
[00:34] for us. And now that it has that
[00:35] information, it wants us to go to the
[00:37] flow editor where we can actually watch
[00:38] it build out the different nodes and the
[00:40] connections right in front of us. So
[00:42] right here on the left, we have our
[00:43] agent builder which allows us to have a
[00:45] conversation with our words to build
[00:47] something. And then over here on the
[00:49] right is the actual like visual flow
[00:51] editor where it will connect nodes and
[00:54] stuff and that's where we can see the
[00:55] configuration. So, the first thing
[00:57] you'll notice over here is that the
[00:58] agent builder asks us some follow-up
[01:00] questions to make sure that it's going
[01:02] to build the system exactly like we want
[01:04] it to. So, it's asking me where to find
[01:06] the leads from if I already have a
[01:07] Google sheet set up, which I do. What's
[01:09] the input method? And then the lead
[01:11] criteria. So, I'm answering its
[01:13] questions by saying to use people data
[01:15] labs for the leads. I told it I already
[01:17] have a sheet set up, which is right
[01:18] here. We've got name, ro, company,
[01:20] company size, email. I said I will talk
[01:23] to the agent. That's how it'll basically
[01:25] get triggered. and no criteria for
[01:27] leads. We're just going to find all of
[01:28] them. So now it's basically saying,
[01:30] okay, here is what I think you want. Let
[01:32] me make sure it's correct. And I'm just
[01:33] going to say yes, and we'll basically
[01:35] see what happens. Okay, so I think it's
[01:37] finished up. You can see all the
[01:38] different steps it went through. It had
[01:40] a few things where it had to figure out
[01:41] what to do, but it did. And ultimately,
[01:43] we came over to this workflow where we
[01:45] have these three nodes. And so before we
[01:48] actually run the test to see how it
[01:50] works, let's just make sure we
[01:51] understand what we're actually looking
[01:53] at. I think that natural language to
[01:54] workflow building is super super cool. I
[01:56] love to see where this technology is
[01:57] going. But I am worried about the false
[02:00] sense of security that it may bring to
[02:01] people if they start using their words,
[02:03] building all this stuff and then just
[02:04] like throwing it into production or
[02:06] starting to use it without actually
[02:08] understanding what's going on within
[02:09] each step. I think that's what's going
[02:10] to be really really crucial because this
[02:12] agent builder type of stuff will be
[02:13] really good at getting you to a first
[02:15] template, a first PC, then you
[02:17] understand it and then you can sort of
[02:18] iterate upon it. So anyways, what we see
[02:20] here is that the trigger of this
[02:22] workflow is a message. So we'll open up
[02:24] a chat and we'll start talking with the
[02:26] agent and probably telling it I want
[02:28] leads in this industry in this location.
[02:30] And then what's next is it will send it
[02:31] off to people data labs to search for
[02:34] those leads. You can see that it's going
[02:36] to be searching using claude for sonnet.
[02:38] It sends off a search query which will
[02:40] be filled in with AI and it's limiting
[02:43] to 10 leads. So it's only going to find
[02:45] 10. We could obviously move this up or
[02:47] down if we wanted to, or we could have
[02:49] the AI actually choose how many to find.
[02:51] But right now, we're just going to leave
[02:52] that at manual 10. And so after it finds
[02:55] those leads, it moves on to this agent
[02:57] step. And you can tell it's an agent
[02:58] because of the little robot or because
[02:59] of the blue arrows. And now we have a
[03:03] prompt for this AI agent. And remember,
[03:05] I didn't make this prompt. The agent
[03:06] builder did it for us. So what it says
[03:09] is that you will receive a list of
[03:10] people from the lead search. For each
[03:12] person on the list, add them to the
[03:14] Google sheet by calling the add tole
[03:15] lead sheet action which is down here.
[03:18] This is kind of like when you connect a
[03:19] tool or an action to an agent and it
[03:21] decides when to use it and it will send
[03:23] over the name, the role, the company,
[03:25] the company size and the email. So now
[03:27] we understand kind of exactly what's
[03:29] going on. I'm going to hit run test and
[03:31] we're going to see this thing kick off.
[03:34] So we have to tell the lead generation
[03:36] agent what industry and location we're
[03:38] looking for. So, I'm just going to say
[03:40] real estate agents
[03:43] in Chicago and fire that off. And then
[03:45] we should see it basically send that off
[03:47] to people data labs. Grab 10 leads back
[03:50] and then our AI agent should be putting
[03:52] that in a Google sheet. All right. So
[03:54] then when we moved on to the agent step,
[03:56] it started processing them one at a
[03:57] time. And what happens was it, you know,
[03:59] it processed the first one, then said,
[04:00] "Okay, now I'll do the the next nine,
[04:01] and then I'll do this one, and now I'll
[04:03] do the next six." And it actually, for
[04:05] some reason, stopped after five. If you
[04:07] see the sheet, it did add them correctly
[04:08] and we have this information we were
[04:10] looking for, but it only sent five of
[04:12] them for some reason. So, we'll come
[04:14] back to the AI agent builder and see if
[04:15] it can fix that. But, it is good to
[04:17] validate that it did what we wanted, but
[04:18] we just need to identify why it stopped
[04:20] after five. I think it potentially could
[04:22] have been because of an exit condition
[04:24] or something like that. But what I'm
[04:25] going to do is just tell the agent
[04:27] builder what went wrong and see what it
[04:28] has to say about it. All right, so I
[04:30] told it that it worked, but it only
[04:31] added five of the leads to the sheet,
[04:33] not all 10. and it said I see the issue
[04:35] blah blah blah and now I'm going to try
[04:36] to fix that. So I'll check back in once
[04:39] it is done and we'll just give it
[04:40] another run. All right, so it says that
[04:41] it fixed it. I deleted everything from
[04:43] the sheet and this time I'm going to say
[04:45] dentist in New York. We'll fire that off
[04:47] and I'll check back in with you guys and
[04:49] see if we got all 10. Okay, so this time
[04:51] after it found the leads, it did in fact
[04:53] do all 10. You can see that it very
[04:54] explicitly went through each individual
[04:56] person. So I think it was a prompting
[04:58] thing, gave us a quick summary and you
[04:59] can see the Google sheet now has 10
[05:01] leads. One thing that's a little strange
[05:03] is this first one came through as a
[05:04] solution consultant from Adobe. The rest
[05:07] do look like at least somewhere in the
[05:08] medical field. And the reason why this
[05:10] happened is because of in the people
[05:13] data labs node that searches for leads.
[05:16] You can see it basically searches using
[05:17] a kind of SQL query and it's looking for
[05:20] job occupations like healthcare or like
[05:22] blank, like dentist. So it's doing kind
[05:25] of like a similar search, not exactly an
[05:27] explicit search. Obviously, that's stuff
[05:29] that we could fix later. But anyways,
[05:31] now that we have this very simple system
[05:32] that basically gives us leads on demand,
[05:35] we want to have another system that
[05:36] takes these leads, enriches them, and
[05:39] helps us write a personalized outreach
[05:40] email. So, I'm going to go back out to
[05:42] the home screen of Lindy, and we're
[05:43] going to talk with our words again to
[05:45] make a different agent. But real quick,
[05:47] I wanted to touch on something that I'm
[05:48] sure some of you guys are wondering if
[05:50] you've been following my channel for a
[05:51] while is why am I making a video on
[05:53] Lindy? What about Eniden? So, I don't
[05:55] want to dive too deep into the specifics
[05:57] of the differences between Eniden and
[05:59] Lindy. I think they both have pros over
[06:01] each other. So, it really depends about
[06:03] your use case. But when I started up
[06:05] this channel, my whole motivation was to
[06:08] go into like no code tools and show how
[06:10] easy it is to build some of these AI
[06:12] automations because I don't come from a
[06:13] technical background and you don't have
[06:15] to to build stuff that really saves
[06:17] time. So, like I said, each one has
[06:18] their pros and cons. Niden, you can
[06:20] self-host. Lindy, you can't. I think
[06:22] that Lindy is a lot less technically
[06:24] overwhelming and intimidating when you
[06:25] look at it because you don't have all
[06:26] these variables to pass over. The way it
[06:28] works with Lindy is the context kind of
[06:31] stacks throughout the whole workflow.
[06:33] What I mean by that is node 2 is going
[06:34] to receive all the context from
[06:36] everything before it and then node 3
[06:37] would receive all the context from
[06:39] everything before it compared to an end
[06:40] where you choose pretty specifically the
[06:42] inputs and outputs for each node. This
[06:44] does not by any means mean that I'm done
[06:46] with nitn. I'm still a very very big fan
[06:48] of the product and will continue to be
[06:50] making editing content just like I have
[06:52] been. But this update from Lindy
[06:53] recently was super cool because not only
[06:55] do they have this agent builder sort of
[06:57] interface, but they also have some
[06:59] native computer use functionality which
[07:00] we won't really build too much of that
[07:02] today. But if you guys are interested,
[07:04] definitely let me know. And if you do
[07:05] want to get into Lindy and try this
[07:06] stuff out, there's already a ton of
[07:08] pre-built agents out here that you can
[07:09] use for meetings, for sales, for brand
[07:11] monitoring, for productivity support.
[07:14] and I was able to work with Lindy and
[07:15] bring you guys a discount code. All you
[07:16] got to do is join my free school
[07:18] community which will be linked in the
[07:19] description. And then once you get
[07:20] there, you'll be able to claim that
[07:22] exclusive discount which will be 30% off
[07:24] and you'll have a free trial before you
[07:26] even have to pay. But anyways, let's
[07:27] move on to the second agent that we need
[07:28] to build for this system. So for the
[07:30] second one, I'm saying build an agent
[07:32] that takes in leads from my Google sheet
[07:34] and enriches them by finding their
[07:35] company's pain points. So we'll shoot
[07:37] this off and we'll go through that same
[07:38] process of watching the agent spin it
[07:41] up. Okay, looks like this one finished
[07:43] up. You can see all the steps that it
[07:44] took and how it was able to fix itself.
[07:46] And now we have a system that when we
[07:48] trigger it, it's going to get the leads
[07:49] from the sheet. The AI here will
[07:52] basically enrich them by searching
[07:54] through the web, looking for pain
[07:55] points, and then writing that data back
[07:57] to the Google sheet and then let us know
[07:58] that it's done. Real quick before we run
[08:00] this, I wanted to talk about why did I
[08:02] split this up into a separate flow.
[08:03] Well, I like to think, especially when
[08:05] you're using natural language to
[08:08] workflow building, you're going to get
[08:10] better results if you break things down
[08:11] into pieces. You could always later on
[08:13] combine it all together, but I think
[08:14] that if you chuck that much stuff at an
[08:16] AI that's trying to build AI systems,
[08:18] it's just going to get messy. So that's
[08:20] why I like to start, you know, very
[08:21] small piece by piece and then bring it
[08:23] together later. Anyways, now that that's
[08:25] out of the way, let's go ahead and run
[08:26] this thing and we'll see how it works.
[08:29] So this one actually doesn't give us a
[08:30] welcome message. I'm just going to go
[08:32] ahead and say enrich the leads. And that
[08:35] should fire off the flow. And now it's
[08:37] going to go to the Google sheet. It's
[08:38] going to pull in these leads that we
[08:40] have right here, these 10. And now it's
[08:42] basically searching the internet. As you
[08:44] can see, it's processing and enriching
[08:45] the leads. And once it finds
[08:47] information, it'll write it all back.
[08:49] So, I'll check in with you guys once
[08:50] that's done. Okay. So, I went ahead and
[08:51] stopped the workflow just because I
[08:53] don't want it to do all 10 because I
[08:54] don't want to sit here and wait and go
[08:55] through credits. I just wanted to prove
[08:57] that this works. And you can see that we
[08:58] have our first four leads enriched with
[09:01] pain points about their business and
[09:02] their industry. And then AI solutions.
[09:05] And this is what we can use to write a
[09:06] really good outreach message. So to
[09:08] break down the system that the agent
[09:10] built for us, the leads come in from the
[09:12] Google sheet. You know, we saw exactly
[09:13] how that worked. It pulls in 10 leads.
[09:16] Then it moves on to this agent step that
[09:18] has access to searching the web and
[09:20] updating the Google sheet. So you can
[09:22] see what it does is it researches each
[09:24] person individually. It started to
[09:25] research the first guy, then it moved on
[09:27] to Henry and it finds this information
[09:29] and then it decides it needs to write it
[09:31] back to Google Sheets. And what's cool
[09:33] is we didn't even have to configure how
[09:34] to update it. It knows how to find the
[09:36] unique identifier. It knows to write it
[09:38] to the data field. And after it was
[09:41] doing this individually for each person,
[09:42] I was like, "Okay, I don't want to run
[09:43] through my credits." And um yeah, we got
[09:46] our research back here. And so the idea
[09:48] is that we'd run the first workflow to
[09:50] get these leads. The second one would
[09:51] automatically fire off when a new row
[09:53] comes in and it would start to enrich
[09:55] the leads. And then we'd have a fourth
[09:56] one fire off once the lead is enriched.
[09:59] and that is the one that's going to
[10:00] write an outreach message. So, let's
[10:02] head back into Lindy. Let's open up
[10:04] another fresh workflow and use natural
[10:07] language to create that. All right, so
[10:08] here is the prompt I'm putting in here.
[10:10] Build an agent that will write
[10:11] personalized outreach messages for our
[10:13] enriched leads from our Google Sheets
[10:14] database. It will craft the message and
[10:16] store it as a Gmail draft, but do not
[10:18] send it. All right, so the agent builder
[10:20] and I had a little bit of a back and
[10:21] forth. I answered some of the questions
[10:23] and then I realized that I also wanted
[10:25] to have it update the row in our lead
[10:27] sheet and say that the draft was created
[10:29] if one has been created. So now we have
[10:31] this final flow. I'm happy with it. I'm
[10:33] going to say yes. You can see also in
[10:35] the lead generation sheet, I added
[10:37] another column called status for the
[10:39] agent to actually update. And now we can
[10:40] go in here and watch it. It's actually
[10:42] getting started building this agent now.
[10:43] So I'll check back in when it's done and
[10:45] we'll give it a run. Okay, so it looks
[10:47] like we are finished up. We've got our
[10:49] manual trigger. We're going to pull in
[10:50] the enriched leads from the spreadsheet.
[10:52] We have an AI agent that's going to
[10:54] write that personalized email. You can
[10:56] see that this was already created for us
[10:58] using AI as well. And after that, it's
[11:00] going to send an a Gmail draft, not an
[11:03] actual Gmail. We've got the two and the
[11:05] subject and the body all being automated
[11:07] with AI. And then we have this being
[11:09] saved as a draft. And then finally, it
[11:11] goes back to the sheet and updates the
[11:12] status of that lead as draft created.
[11:15] So, we're going to go ahead and run this
[11:16] thing. I'm just going to go ahead and
[11:18] say go in here. here. And just keep in
[11:19] mind, we're only going to be doing four
[11:21] leads because only four of them actually
[11:23] have been enriched at this point. So,
[11:24] we've pulled in all the data and now we
[11:26] should see that the AI is writing those
[11:28] messages. Okay, so this just finished
[11:30] up. However, what I realized that is
[11:33] that it only pulled in one, I think. So,
[11:35] when it got the spreadsheet limit was
[11:38] a,000. Okay, it pulled in all 10, but
[11:40] did it do all 10? I'm not sure. If we go
[11:42] to the Google sheet, we can see that we
[11:44] only have one draft created for the
[11:46] first lead. But let's go take a look at
[11:47] it real quick. Okay, so I do have the
[11:49] email in my draft. We've got the two,
[11:50] the subject, and the body filled out.
[11:52] And we can see that it addresses
[11:54] basically his role and his company. And
[11:57] then it goes into how our AI solutions
[11:59] could address their problems that
[12:01] they're currently seeing. And then
[12:02] there's a call to action at the bottom.
[12:04] It also signs off as Nate. And then we
[12:06] could also get rid of this sent via
[12:07] Lindy automated message. So the issue
[12:10] now is that it only processed one. So
[12:12] what I'm going to do is say that that
[12:13] worked, but only one of them got
[12:14] processed. similar to what we had to do
[12:16] in one of the that first example. And
[12:18] this is actually a really great point
[12:19] that I want to touch on real quick
[12:20] because you want to also think about as
[12:22] the system is actually running, how can
[12:24] we make sure it doesn't error. And one
[12:26] thing that would currently cause us to
[12:28] error besides the fact that the AI
[12:29] originally built this wrong or not
[12:31] wrong, but it didn't take everything
[12:32] into consideration is that now that
[12:34] we're going to rerun this, we'd be
[12:36] duplicating outreach messages to Alex
[12:38] because there's already one created, but
[12:40] it's the first row, so it would go
[12:41] again. So, you'd probably want to make
[12:42] sure you're setting up a filter where if
[12:44] the status equals draft created, you're
[12:46] not going to push it through the rest of
[12:47] the pipeline and create another draft.
[12:49] So, just something I wanted to throw out
[12:50] there, but let's make this change and
[12:51] then we'll test it again. And actually,
[12:52] you can see that was the third option
[12:54] that the AI suggested was to process all
[12:56] leads that don't have a draft created
[12:58] status. So, that's what we're going to
[12:59] do. All right, so it said it made those
[13:00] changes. I'm going to go ahead and run a
[13:02] test and we'll see. So, I'm just going
[13:04] to say go. We'll fire that off and let
[13:06] it get to work. Okay, so this one worked
[13:08] as expected. As you can see, it went
[13:10] through all of the leads, but then what
[13:12] it said is that out of the 10, it only
[13:14] did two because one of them already had
[13:16] draft created, and then the other seven
[13:18] had no data, as you can see. So, we
[13:21] stopped it after just these first three
[13:22] had data. So, it only decided to create
[13:24] drafts for these two rows right here.
[13:25] Real quick, let me go to my drafts and
[13:27] make sure that it has a good flow. So,
[13:29] here's the one we got for Jim. AI
[13:30] solutions for dental practice management
[13:32] challenges. I noticed your role as this
[13:34] at this company. here are different
[13:35] challenges that you're facing and how
[13:37] our AI solutions can help address those
[13:39] specific challenges. Would you be open
[13:41] to a 15-minute call to see how we can
[13:43] benefit you? So, considering that we did
[13:45] no prompting in here ourselves and that
[13:47] this entire thing was mapped, all the
[13:50] variables were processed, all of the
[13:51] mapping from the spreadsheets and
[13:52] everything like that was processed all
[13:54] by this agent builder right here. And
[13:56] all three of these agents took me about
[13:57] 30 minutes to build tops. Really, really
[14:00] impressed. And from here, what we'd want
[14:01] to do is actually iterate, continue to
[14:03] test, and make these even better. Which
[14:05] is why it's really important that we
[14:07] went through the process of like talking
[14:09] to the agent, having it develop
[14:10] something, and then we still want to go
[14:12] into every single node and understand
[14:14] what's going on. Because now what we
[14:15] could do is branch off these different
[14:17] conditional paths and say, okay, you
[14:18] know, like now let's create a follow-up
[14:20] agent and make sure every 2 3 days we're
[14:22] going to continue to follow up with
[14:23] these leads. We could even then start to
[14:25] go back to the other agents that we had
[14:26] built for lead genen and enrichment and
[14:28] figure out okay how do we actually link
[14:30] these together and make the enrichment
[14:32] even better because I think ideally
[14:34] these would all just be one big flow
[14:36] with multiple agents or it would
[14:38] basically be like I said earlier when
[14:40] the leads come in the second flow to
[14:42] enrich them automatically kicks off and
[14:44] then once the data is enriched there the
[14:46] third flow to write that outreach
[14:47] automatically kicks off and then you'd
[14:49] build up another flow to do the
[14:50] follow-ups and so on and so on maybe
[14:52] even all the way into like onboarding
[14:54] stuff like that. So, I don't want this
[14:56] video to go on too long, but you can see
[14:58] in just the past 30 minutes that we were
[15:00] sitting here together, I built pretty
[15:01] much a fully automated system. All I
[15:03] have to do is connect those pieces and
[15:05] now I can ask for leads on demand and
[15:07] get all the drafts created
[15:08] automatically. And it's only going to
[15:10] get better and better as I improve the
[15:11] prompts and the search criteria and the
[15:13] lead criteria and stuff like that. So,
[15:15] there's a lot of stuff in Lindy that I
[15:16] haven't yet talked about that's very new
[15:18] and very cool, especially the computer
[15:19] use. That's probably my favorite feature
[15:21] so far. So, if you guys do want to see
[15:23] more videos about Lindy, let me know in
[15:24] the comments. And don't forget that you
[15:26] can get 30% off Lindy if you join my
[15:28] free school community. There'll be a
