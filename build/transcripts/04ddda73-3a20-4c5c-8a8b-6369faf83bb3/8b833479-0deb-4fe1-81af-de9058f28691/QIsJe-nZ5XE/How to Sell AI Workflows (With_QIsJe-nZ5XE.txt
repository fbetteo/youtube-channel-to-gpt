[00:00] So today I'm going to teach you guys how
[00:01] to sell AI workflows without starting an
[00:03] agency. Because the truth is, if you've
[00:05] never actually sold AI workflows before,
[00:06] building an agency is probably the worst
[00:08] move you can make. You'll be drowning in
[00:10] client headaches and you'll probably
[00:11] want to give up before you make any real
[00:12] money. But there's a way smarter way to
[00:14] profit from AI workflows. One that's
[00:16] simpler, faster, doesn't involve hiring
[00:18] anyone or quitting your job. In fact,
[00:20] it's exactly how I went from zero AI
[00:22] experience to making thousands per
[00:24] workflow without quitting my job. So, in
[00:26] this video, I'm going to break down why
[00:27] you shouldn't start an agency, what to
[00:28] do instead, and how to sell your first
[00:30] AI workflows step by step. Why starting
[00:32] an agency is a trap. Everyone online
[00:34] seems to be pushing this narrative that
[00:36] if you want to make money with AI
[00:37] workflows, you have to start an agency.
[00:39] But that's definitely not the case. And
[00:41] here's why I had that realization. When
[00:42] I first started, I did not really
[00:44] understand the nitty-gritty of what goes
[00:46] into a project. I didn't know how to
[00:47] price properly. I definitely didn't
[00:48] realize how many little complexities
[00:50] will pop up in actually delivering that
[00:52] final product. My mindset was basically
[00:53] this. get in, get money, get out. So,
[00:56] I'd quote something like $1,500 for a
[00:58] build, thinking, "Wow, I'm about to make
[00:59] $1,500." But then I'd get into it and
[01:01] I'd realize this is going to take me a
[01:02] lot longer than I thought. I'd already
[01:04] agreed on the price. We'd signed off and
[01:06] now I am stuck. I just shot myself in
[01:08] the foot. I was wearing all the hats,
[01:09] scoping, sales, building, delivery, and
[01:11] I was taking a huge loss. But if I had
[01:13] been running an agency, that problem
[01:15] would have actually been 10 times worse.
[01:17] Because in an agency, you'd have to hand
[01:19] that product to a developer, and the
[01:20] developer might say, "This isn't enough
[01:21] money for this build." and now you just
[01:23] slashed your margins. Or they'd ask you
[01:24] for like a full project requirement doc
[01:26] and you don't even know how to write
[01:27] that yet. Same thing if you had a
[01:28] salesperson or appointment setter doing
[01:30] your calls. If you don't know how to
[01:31] scope accurately, they probably won't
[01:33] either. Now you've got a bad price, a
[01:35] bad proposal, and a mess to deliver on.
[01:37] And in an agency, that's going to hurt
[01:38] more than just your bottom line. It's
[01:40] going to hurt your brand and your
[01:41] reputation. I've seen people go allin on
[01:43] the agency model, close a bunch of
[01:45] sales, and then realize that their
[01:46] developers aren't as good as they
[01:47] thought or they can't afford enough of
[01:49] them. They're stretched way too thin,
[01:51] drowning in projects, and now they're
[01:52] not delivering on any of them on time or
[01:55] at all. That's not a business. That's a
[01:56] stress machine. And here's the thing.
[01:58] One of the worst parts of running an
[01:59] agency isn't just the technical side or
[02:01] the delivery problems. It's juggling
[02:03] multiple clients at once, all with
[02:05] different personalities, expectations,
[02:07] and timelines. If you don't align on
[02:09] these expectations with your clients
[02:10] from the very beginning, it's going to
[02:11] be a nightmare. And I've seen that
[02:13] myself. Even if someone is willing to
[02:14] hand you $5,000, that doesn't
[02:16] automatically mean you want them as a
[02:18] client. AI isn't magic. Some people
[02:20] think it is. And if the client is in
[02:21] debt and hoping that your AI workflows
[02:23] can save their business, you're setting
[02:25] yourself up in a really bad situation.
[02:27] That kind of pressure will make the
[02:28] project miserable for both of you guys.
[02:30] You don't want clients who are insanely
[02:32] riskaverse and looking for AI to plug
[02:34] every hole in a sinking ship. You want
[02:36] people who are forwardinking, who see AI
[02:38] as an investment to get ahead of the
[02:39] curve, not as a lastditch lifeline. One
[02:42] of my go-to discovery questions was
[02:44] always, "What do you think about AI and
[02:46] where do you think it's going?" This
[02:47] answer told me a lot. If they were
[02:48] hesitant or skeptical, I knew they'd
[02:50] probably resist the process. If they
[02:51] were excited and bullish, that's the
[02:52] kind of person who I want to work with
[02:54] and who's going to be a great partner.
[02:55] The real issue with diving into an
[02:57] agency first is that you're trying to
[02:58] run before you've learned to walk. You
[03:00] haven't yet learned the full journey
[03:01] from the first outreach message to
[03:03] scoping the project in detail, building
[03:04] it, deploying it, and deciding how to
[03:06] support it long term. And until you've
[03:08] done that whole process yourself, no way
[03:10] you'll know how to lead a team through
[03:11] it. Beyond just team size, the
[03:13] difference is an agency owner is usually
[03:14] taking inbound requests, helping deliver
[03:16] them. A consultant is actually being
[03:18] approached as the expert. The business
[03:19] owner is going to say, "Help me figure
[03:21] out what I need. I'm here to listen to
[03:22] you." Consultants get paid for their
[03:23] brain and their expertise, not for how
[03:25] many employees they manage. And for me,
[03:27] it's not just about making money.
[03:28] Sustainable growth means you enjoy what
[03:30] you're doing. You keep learning and you
[03:32] build something that has long-term
[03:33] potential. Think of it like learning
[03:34] golf. When you first start, you're going
[03:36] to get blisters on your hands. That's
[03:37] just part of building the skill. And you
[03:39] can't wear three golf club gloves
[03:41] forever every single time you want to
[03:42] play. You're going to look ridiculous.
[03:44] So, you'll get those early blisters
[03:45] figuring things out solo. And that will
[03:47] make you stronger and it will make you a
[03:49] better leader later. When I made my
[03:50] first $1,200 from an end-to-end
[03:52] workflow, it came from an inbound lead,
[03:53] someone who had seen something I built
[03:55] and reached out. We had a casual
[03:57] conversation about what they needed and
[03:58] I was able to deliver on it myself and
[04:00] they were happy. That project gave me
[04:02] the confidence to know I can do this.
[04:04] And from there, I learned how to scope
[04:05] better, price better, and eventually
[04:07] teach other people my system. If I had
[04:09] to start over, I'd 100% begin as a
[04:11] freelancer, then move into consulting.
[04:13] And only then once I'm really good at
[04:14] the process, think about building a team
[04:16] around me. Because when you start solo,
[04:18] you learn the foundations, you protect
[04:19] your margins, and you actually enjoy the
[04:21] process instead of burning out. The
[04:23] alternative, becoming an AI consultant.
[04:25] So, if starting an agency isn't the
[04:27] right first move, what's the
[04:28] alternative? For me, the answer was
[04:29] simple. Become an AI consultant. Now,
[04:31] when I say consultant, I don't mean
[04:32] you're sitting in an office all day
[04:33] writing 50page reports and sending
[04:35] invoices. I mean, you're getting paid
[04:36] for your brain, for your ability to see
[04:38] how a business works, spot
[04:39] inefficiencies, and design AI workflows
[04:42] and systems to actually solve those
[04:44] specific problems. You're the strategist
[04:45] and the builder, and you don't need a
[04:47] team to get started. This was a game
[04:48] changer for me because I didn't have to
[04:50] manage developers, juggle payroll, or
[04:52] figure out how to keep 10 clients happy
[04:53] at once. I could just focus on the one
[04:55] problem in front of me, just one at a
[04:56] time, solve it well, and move on. The
[04:58] thing I love about consulting is you can
[05:00] jump into real high impact problems
[05:02] quickly, like helping an ecom brand
[05:03] automate 80% of their customer support
[05:05] or building a lead qualification chatbot
[05:07] for a coach so they only talk to their
[05:08] most serious prospects. Those things I
[05:10] just mentioned aren't nice to have
[05:11] projects. They actually save time, cut
[05:13] costs, and help those businesses make
[05:15] more money, which means those business
[05:17] owners will be happy to pay a lot of
[05:19] money for those. And here's where it
[05:20] gets exciting. Big consulting firms are
[05:22] making millions just on strategy before
[05:25] they even actually build or implement
[05:26] anything. Enterprise AI assessments can
[05:28] range from $7,000 to $50,000. Strategic
[05:31] AI road mapaps for mid-market companies
[05:33] can cost $90,000 to a4 million. Asenture
[05:36] actually booked $600 million in AI
[05:38] consulting in just one quarter and $2.6
[05:41] billion in 6 months. The only reason
[05:43] small and mediumsiz businesses aren't
[05:44] paying firms like McKenzie or BCG for AI
[05:47] help is because they simply can't afford
[05:49] it. But they still want and need that
[05:51] level of guidance. And that's where you
[05:53] can step in at a fraction of the price.
[05:54] Your first step, become an AI
[05:56] freelancer. Of course, before you can
[05:58] become a consultant, you want to have
[05:59] some proof that you can deliver. And
[06:01] that's where freelancing comes in. I
[06:02] know the term freelancing doesn't sound
[06:04] as shiny as consulting or agency owner,
[06:06] but this stage is critical. As a
[06:08] freelancer, you're getting paid to
[06:09] learn. You're testing different
[06:10] workflows, solving real problems, and
[06:12] building up your portfolio, all without
[06:14] the pressure of running a big operation.
[06:16] The goal here isn't to make millions
[06:17] overnight. It's to rack up three to five
[06:19] solid paid results that you can show as
[06:22] proof of what you can do. For me,
[06:23] freelancing gave me four things that I
[06:25] couldn't skip. Proof of results, so that
[06:27] when I said, "I can save you x hours a
[06:29] week." I actually had examples.
[06:30] Testimonials, actual words from clients
[06:32] to build my credibility, confidence in
[06:34] my process, I knew how to handle a
[06:36] project from start to finish, and
[06:37] clarity on my niche. I learned who I
[06:39] liked working with and who actually paid
[06:41] well. Without those things, moving into
[06:42] consulting would have been guesswork.
[06:44] One win led to another and another. Each
[06:47] time I learned more about how to
[06:48] communicate with clients, how to price
[06:49] correctly, and how to spot red flags
[06:51] before taking on a project. You just
[06:53] have to be in that mindset of getting
[06:55] paid to practice. You're not just trying
[06:56] to make as much money as possible on
[06:58] every deal. You're trying to get better,
[06:59] faster, and more efficient with each
[07:01] project. What you're doing here is
[07:02] optimizing for experience rather than
[07:04] cost. So, if that means you end up doing
[07:06] your first project or two for free in
[07:08] exchange for a testimonial and a case
[07:10] study, that's 100% worth it. Think of it
[07:12] like building your own playbook. So when
[07:14] you eventually start consulting, you're
[07:15] not figuring things out for the first
[07:16] time with a high ticket client breathing
[07:18] down your neck. So the big question
[07:20] remaining is how do you actually sell
[07:21] your first AI workflows as a freelancer?
[07:24] How to sell AI workflows? So now you
[07:26] know why we start with freelancing and
[07:28] why those first three to five projects
[07:29] matter so much. Let's talk about how to
[07:31] actually land them because the process
[07:32] is way simpler than most people think.
[07:34] Here's exactly how I go from zero to a
[07:36] paid AI workflow deal. Step one, choose
[07:38] a painoint to solve. The first mistake a
[07:40] lot of people make is just saying, "I
[07:42] can automate anything. Just tell me what
[07:44] you need." That's way too broad. You
[07:45] need to pick a specific type of person
[07:46] that you want to help. Coaches, ecom
[07:48] store owners, agencies, whatever, and
[07:50] pick one clear problem to solve for
[07:52] them. Now, I'll be honest. I ultimately
[07:54] went broad because I had a lot of
[07:55] inbound leads from the channel, but if
[07:56] you're starting from scratch, I highly
[07:58] recommend niching down. Not only will it
[08:00] make your outreach and your content more
[08:02] consistent, but it will help you convert
[08:03] at a higher rate, deliver better
[08:05] results, and you'll end up being able to
[08:07] charge more. Think of it like this. A
[08:08] steakhouse can charge a premium for a
[08:10] little 6oz fillet, while an all you can
[08:12] eat buffet might give you a 24- oz
[08:14] ribeye for cheap. When you specialize,
[08:16] you're the steakhouse. People pay more
[08:18] for a specific thing that you're really
[08:19] good at. Step two is to build a simple
[08:21] demo or case study. People need to see
[08:23] it to believe it. That's why I would
[08:25] always create a quick demo. Sometimes
[08:26] just like a quick 2-minute Loom video,
[08:28] just showing a before and after. For
[08:30] example, the before could be a coach
[08:32] manually messaging every lead to qualify
[08:33] them. The after could be your chatbot in
[08:36] action, which does that automatically
[08:37] and only books qualified leads onto the
[08:39] coach's calendar. You're showing the
[08:41] destination, not the car that gets them
[08:43] there. AI is the car. The result is the
[08:45] actual destination that the business
[08:47] owner cares about. Step three is to
[08:48] outreach with a strong offer. You need
[08:50] to make the offer something that the
[08:52] business owner would feel stupid if they
[08:54] said no to. And what a lot of
[08:55] freelancers miss out on is that you have
[08:56] to speak their language. Business owners
[08:58] speak in money and time. If you can
[09:00] relate everything back to those two
[09:01] things and make it a no-brainer, you'll
[09:03] close deals at a much higher rate. A
[09:05] no-brainer to me sounds like this. Hey,
[09:07] you're doing this process manually,
[09:09] which takes you 5 hours a week. If you
[09:10] value your time at $100 an hour, that's
[09:12] $500 a week. Over a month, $2,000. Over
[09:15] a year, $24,000. Now, if I can go ahead
[09:17] and build you a system that eliminates
[09:19] all of that manual work, I'm not just
[09:21] giving you back 20 hours a month, which
[09:22] is huge. I'm also giving you back $2,000
[09:25] a month in value. So, paying me only
[09:27] $2,000 for that solution is a no-brainer
[09:29] because over the course of the year,
[09:30] you're getting back 240 hours and saving
[09:32] $22,000. Step four, deliver, document,
[09:36] and capture metrics. After you've got a
[09:38] client on board, your next job is to
[09:39] track metrics before and after the
[09:41] automation goes live. Ask questions
[09:43] like, "How long does this task take
[09:45] manually? What's the error percentage?
[09:46] How many leads or tickets are processed
[09:48] per week?" Then, after your system's up
[09:50] and running, measure those same numbers
[09:52] again. This will do two things for you.
[09:53] The first one is that it will give you a
[09:55] rock-solid case study to win future
[09:56] clients because you're objectively
[09:58] proving that your system added value.
[10:00] And second, it shows the client in black
[10:02] and white numbers that their investment
[10:03] paid off. And when they see that proof,
[10:05] they're obviously way more likely to
[10:06] give you a strong testimonial because
[10:08] now you've helped them feel the value,
[10:10] not just hear about it. Remember, you're
[10:12] not selling AI. AI is the tool. What
[10:14] you're really selling is the time saved,
[10:15] the money saved, the extra revenue
[10:17] generated, the ability to avoid hiring
[10:19] another employee. When you figure out
[10:20] someone's painoint and you press on it,
[10:22] then show how your workflow gets rid of
[10:23] it, closing the deal becomes way easier.
[10:25] Transitioning to an AI consultant. Now
[10:27] that you've done a couple projects and
[10:29] you have your testimonials and your case
[10:30] studies, you have the credibility to
[10:32] raise your prices. You can package your
[10:34] offers differently and start selling
[10:35] like a true consultant. As a freelancer,
[10:37] your pitch is usually tell me what you
[10:39] need, I'll build it. As a consultant,
[10:41] your pitch becomes more of a let me
[10:42] figure out what you actually need, then
[10:44] I'll design the solution for you. And
[10:46] this shift fundamentally changes how
[10:48] clients look at you. You're no longer
[10:50] just an extra set of hands or, you know,
[10:51] a subcontractor that they can push some
[10:53] work to. You're the expert, the
[10:55] strategist. You're the one they trust to
[10:56] guide them through the chaos and all of
[10:58] this noise of AI and automation. And
[11:01] once you've proven you can deliver those
[11:02] results, you can stop charging for tasks
[11:04] and start charging for outcomes. As a
[11:06] freelancer, you might be charging $1 to
[11:08] $5,000 per project. As a consultant, you
[11:10] can package that same expertise into
[11:12] $10,000 plus solutions because now
[11:15] you're not just building workflows,
[11:16] you're designing systems and integrating
[11:18] into a company's specific operation. And
[11:20] those systems are worth a lot more than
[11:22] a single automation. This is where I
[11:24] stopped thinking in terms of projects
[11:25] and started thinking in terms of
[11:27] systems. Instead of saying, "I'll build
[11:28] you a chatbot for $2,500." I'd say,
[11:31] "I'll design and implement a full lead
[11:33] qualification system that runs 24/7,
[11:35] save your sales team 20 hours a week,
[11:36] and increases conversion rates, and
[11:38] we'll build that together over the next
[11:39] month." Pretty similar work, but it's
[11:41] framed as a high-value business changing
[11:43] solution. As consultant, part of what
[11:44] you're selling is thinking beyond the
[11:46] build. I've had projects where the
[11:47] strategy document I delivered outlining
[11:49] exactly where AI should and shouldn't be
[11:51] used in the business, was actually worth
[11:52] more to the client than the workflows
[11:54] themselves. Because now you're not just
[11:55] the automation person, you're the person
[11:57] who makes sure their AI strategy makes
[11:58] sense, actually works, and drives ROI.
[12:01] This is also where you start to land
[12:02] longerterm engagements, which should
[12:04] definitely be the goal. Monthly
[12:05] retainers, ongoing advisory roles, even
[12:08] revenue share deals. These aren't
[12:09] oneanddone builds. These are
[12:10] partnerships where clients keep you
[12:12] around because you're continuously
[12:13] spotting new opportunities for them to
[12:15] save time, money, and make more money.
[12:17] And this is exactly where you want to be
[12:19] before you even think about hiring a
[12:21] team or building a full agency. Remember
[12:23] those insane figures I mentioned
[12:24] earlier? A center booking $600 million
[12:26] in AI consulting in a quarter and then
[12:28] 2.6 billion in generative AI related
[12:30] sales. If billiondollar companies are
[12:32] pouring that much into AI consulting,
[12:34] there's an enormous opportunity for
[12:35] skilled individuals to carve out their
[12:37] piece of the market, especially for
[12:38] small and mid-size businesses who can't
[12:40] pay enterprise rates but still need
[12:42] expert guidance. And then when you nail
[12:44] that aspect, the next logical step, if
[12:46] you even want to do it, is building a
[12:47] team around you. But now you'll be doing
[12:49] it with the skills, confidence, and
[12:51] processes to make sure it actually
[12:52] works. So here's the big picture. Don't
[12:54] jump into an agency too fast. It's a lot
[12:56] harder to get right when you don't have
[12:58] the experience yet. Start as a
[12:59] freelancer. Use that stage to learn the
[13:01] craft, deliver results, and build
[13:02] credibility. Then take those wins and
[13:04] evolve into an AI consultant where
[13:06] you're not just building workflows.
[13:08] You're solving real business problems,
[13:09] and getting paid for your expertise.
[13:11] That's the path I took, and it's the one
[13:12] I recommend if you want this to be
[13:14] sustainable, enjoyable, and actually
[13:16] profitable long term. You don't have to
[13:18] quit your job tomorrow. You don't have
[13:19] to hire a team right away. You just have
[13:20] to take the next step that's right in
[13:22] front of you and focus on that. Get your
[13:24] first few wins and continue to build off
[13:26] of that momentum from there. Now, I
[13:27] don't want this video to go too long,
[13:28] but I tried to pack as much value as I
[13:30] could into it. And if you want to get
[13:31] this full document, so you can go ahead
[13:32] and take a look at it. Could be a great
[13:34] resource for you. I'll drop that in my
[13:35] free school community, which will be
[13:37] linked in the description. And of
[13:38] course, if this kind of stuff interests
[13:39] you and you're looking to connect with
[13:40] other people who are just as interested
[13:42] in it, then definitely check out my plus
[13:43] community. The link for that will also
[13:44] be in the description. I do a live Q&A
[13:46] every week in there. There's educational
[13:48] resources, but really what I think is
[13:49] the most valuable is the actual network
[13:51] of people who are also paying to be a
[13:53] member, so you know they're taking it
[13:54] seriously. So, I'd love to see you guys
[13:56] in those communities. But that's going
[13:57] to do it for today. If you enjoyed the
[13:58] video or you learned something new,
[13:59] please give it a like. Definitely helps
[14:01] me out a ton. And as always, I
[14:02] appreciate you guys making it to the end
[14:03] of the video. I'll see you on the next
[14:04] one. Thanks everyone.
