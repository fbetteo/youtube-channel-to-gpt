[00:00] This is the next evolution of AI agents,
[00:02] giving them long-term memory with
[00:03] relational graphs. All right, so I'm
[00:05] saying, "Hello, ask me questions to get
[00:06] to know me." And there's nothing in the
[00:08] memory as you guys can see. It's going
[00:10] to come back and ask us some questions.
[00:11] So I'm responding to the agent by
[00:13] saying, "My name is Jim. I love playing
[00:14] soccer and I live in Florida in the
[00:16] United States." But real quick, let's go
[00:18] over to Zep. We should see we now have
[00:19] this user. And if I click into the user,
[00:21] we have two things to look at. The first
[00:23] one is the sessions. So these sessions
[00:25] are basically the same way we have that
[00:27] context where it's going to store these
[00:28] pairs of what was the human message and
[00:30] what was the AI response. But then if I
[00:32] click into the graph, this is where
[00:33] we're going to have that knowledge graph
[00:35] with different relationships start to
[00:37] form. So this is us. This is the user.
[00:39] You can see the summary says the user ID
[00:41] blank is named Jim. He's interested in
[00:43] playing soccer. So we have this over
[00:44] here which is a like. We have this down
[00:46] here which is lives in Florida. And then
[00:48] we have our AI assistant right here. And
[00:50] just to show you guys what this all
[00:51] looks like, I'm basically just going to
[00:52] send off what should I do this weekend.
[00:54] It's going to get information about us
[00:56] and tell us what we should do. The agent
[00:58] responded with, "Hey Jim, since you love
[00:59] playing soccer and are a goalie, how
[01:01] about combining your passion with some
[01:03] fun? Join a soccer game or scrimmage,
[01:05] practice some goalie drills, explore a
[01:07] new park or beach since you're in
[01:08] Florida, blah blah blah." Exactly like I
[01:10] predicted. If you want to watch the full
