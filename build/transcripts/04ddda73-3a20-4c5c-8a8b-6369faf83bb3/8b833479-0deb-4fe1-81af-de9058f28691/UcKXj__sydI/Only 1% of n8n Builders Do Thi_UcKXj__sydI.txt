[00:00] Here's how to run parallel executions in
[00:01] NAN. So, I don't want to waste any time.
[00:03] I'm just going to run a quick visual
[00:04] demo so that you guys can see how slow
[00:06] this is when you run something
[00:08] sequentially rather than in parallel.
[00:10] This AI agent is going to process each
[00:11] tool and each research one at a time.
[00:14] So, right now, it's working on the first
[00:15] tool. And we can tell because if I move
[00:17] this stuff down, you can see it's only
[00:19] done one item. Now, it's going to do the
[00:20] second one. Now, it's going to do the
[00:22] third one, and so on. But, if we would
[00:23] have had this agent running in parallel,
[00:25] this would have finished up like 20
[00:26] seconds ago already. So, in a recent
[00:28] update of NAND, they added this cool
[00:29] feature where you can basically select
[00:31] nodes, rightclick, and then say, I want
[00:34] to convert these seven nodes to a sub
[00:36] workflow. And what happens is when I
[00:37] click on this button, it's basically
[00:38] going to tell me to name my workflow.
[00:40] I'm just going to keep it as my sub
[00:41] workflow for now. And when I hit
[00:42] confirm, it turns all of that into a
[00:44] subworkflow. And it's already linked up
[00:46] right here and being called by this guy.
[00:49] So, we'll go ahead and execute the
[00:51] workflow. It's going to grab our tools.
[00:52] It's going to pass them into the sub
[00:53] workflow right there. I'll click into
[00:55] the sub workflow and click on
[00:56] executions. And you can see right here,
[00:58] we now have all four of them running
[01:00] completely in parallel. And they're all
[01:02] going to finish up a lot quicker than if
[01:03] the AI agent was doing an analysis on
[01:05] each of them individually. If you want
[01:07] to watch that full breakdown, click on
[01:08] that play button right here. And I'll
[01:09] see you guys over there.
