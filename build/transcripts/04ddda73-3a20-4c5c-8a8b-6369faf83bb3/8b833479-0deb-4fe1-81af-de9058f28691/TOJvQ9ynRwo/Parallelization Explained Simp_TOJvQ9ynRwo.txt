[00:00] Today I'm going to be talking about an
[00:01] automation technique that I hardly see
[00:03] anyone talking about on YouTube and I've
[00:04] actually never covered it on this
[00:06] channel either. Understanding
[00:07] parallelization and subworkflows is
[00:09] really going to level up your automation
[00:10] game. Okay, so what parallelization is
[00:13] besides a mouthful is that you're
[00:15] running multiple tasks at the same time
[00:17] instead of one after another. And just
[00:19] in case it hasn't quite stuck yet,
[00:20] pretend that we want to cook these three
[00:22] turkeys and they each will take 30
[00:24] minutes to cook, but we only have one
[00:26] oven to use. So without parallelization,
[00:28] we'd cook the first one and then we'd
[00:30] cook the second one and then we'd cook
[00:31] the third one and it would take a total
[00:33] of 90 minutes. But if we're able to use
[00:35] parallelization, which means we would
[00:37] have three ovens that can all run at the
[00:39] same time, the whole cook time of these
[00:41] three turkeys would only be 30 minutes
[00:43] and it's just going to be a lot more
[00:44] efficient. Now let's quickly talk about
[00:46] drawbacks and considerations of using
[00:48] parallelization resource limits. So, for
[00:50] example, in our flow where we're calling
[00:52] perplexity to do some research, we may
[00:54] have a limit where you can't do more
[00:56] than 20 per minute or something like
[00:57] that. And if you do run into an issue
[00:59] like that, then you do have to consider
[01:01] looping individually through each item
[01:03] or sending over batches of 20 or
[01:05] something like that. You can't process a
[01:07] 100 items all in parallel. Another thing
[01:09] to think about would be error handling.
[01:11] So, if you're running 50 items in
[01:12] parallel and one of them errors, how do
[01:14] you handle just that one that aired and
[01:16] what do you want to do with the rest of
[01:17] the ones? Okay, so that's drawbacks and
[01:20] considerations of parallelization. And
[01:22] so clearly you don't always want to go
[01:23] straight for parallelization, but it's
[01:25] really important to understand still to
[01:27] use subflows because subworkflows are
[01:29] really valuable. If you want to watch
