I try to make contact with the part of my foot that is in between the inside part of the foot and the laces and I imagine hitting just lower than the outside center of the ball, wrapping my foot around the football.

Absolutely not. There are countless teenagers where after talking with them, I\u2019ve pushed them to skip college and pursue the semi-pro or pro route domestically or abroad. \n\nYou have to look at your situation, your opportunities, your goals for your playing career and life post footy, and make the best decision for you. #BecomeElite",

Yes, definitely. I love incorporating a smaller soccer ball in my first touch sessions or tight space dribbling sessions to improve my touch and control of the ball. Now, you shouldn't ALWAYS train with a small ball, because I'm a firm believer in that you should practice how you play, but still there are huge benefits to training with a smaller sized soccer ball especially in terms of developing control/touch. \n\nEssentially we are following Matt Sheldon's daily schedule.

      "description": "FOLLOW ME!\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mattsheldon23/\nBecome Elite on Instagram: @Become_Elite\n\nToday's video is all an example video of how I study soccer games in order to improve at my position of right back. I take a professional soccer game at the highest level (Bundesliga, EPL, La Liga) and I just watch and learn from the player in my position. \n\nIn this video, I study Borussia Mochengladbach vs FC Bayern Munich and just watch Jantschke play. I study his movements, off ball patterns, passing decisions, defensive positioning to try to learn from him. \n\nMy hope for this video is to teach you how I learn, so that you can take these same skills and apply them to a different professional soccer match so you can learn from a different player who plays in your specific position.

      "description": "FOLLOW ME!\nSnapchat: become_elite\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mattsheldon23/\nBecome Elite on Instagram: @Become_Elite\n\nBelow is MY rehab regimen, I am not saying this is how you should recover from your patellar tendinitis as everyone recovers at different speeds. I was always listening to my body, tracking how I felt, and making the next day's workout dependent on that. \n\nMy Rehab Regimen:\n\nDay 1-10: Stopped all weightlifting, soccer, and running activities, rested as much as possible, iced 3-5x a day for 20 minutes. My goal was to rest until \nDay 11-18: Introduced static stretching and light bodyweight exercises as long as it didn't hurt my knee and make it worse the next day. If knee felt better than the day before, I progressively made each workout harder than the previous by adding more sets, reps, or time.\nDay 19-28: Started to introduce biking to the workout regimen. Progressively making each biking session harder than the previous if knee allowed so. Continued to stretch and preform bodyweight workouts. \nDay 29-40: Started to introduce light jogging and running workouts. Stopped biking, but continued to stretch. Again, made each workout harder than the last as long as knee responded well and felt stronger. Started to also add weight to all exercises and progressively added more and more weight with each workout. \nDay 41-48: Started to add soccer training sessions to the workout regimen. Continued to stretch, perform exercises with increasingly heavier weights, and continued to make each running workout harder than the last. Made each soccer training session slightly more rigorous than the last.\nDay 49+: Started Preseason with Saint Louis FC. Stopped personal soccer training and running sessions, but continued to stretch and perform exercises with added weight. \n\n\n\n\nWebsite: www.become-elite.com\nPrograms: http://www.become-elite.com/programs.html\nEMAIL me: becomeelitesoccer@gmail.com\n\nEssentially we are following Matt Sheldon's daily schedule.

      "description": "EMAIL US at becomeelitesoccer@gmail.com\nFOLLOW us on Instagram: @Become_Elite\nVISIT our Website: http://www.become-elite.com\nBE COACHED by Become Elite: http://become-elite.com/customized-pa...\n\nMany of you guys have asked for a tutorial/tips/advice on how to cross a soccer ball. This is also known as a whipped in cross, a curler, a curve kick, bending the ball, etc. Here is what goes through my head when I attempt to preform this type of kick. \n\nHow to Cross a Soccer Ball:\n1. Keep the ball on the outside of your body while dribbling straight down the sideline.\n2. Tap the ball 30 degrees in to the center of the field 3-5 yards before you want to whip in the cross.\n3. Open up your hips into the center of the field slightly.\n4. Plant your foot closer than normal to the the ball to allow for the ball to roll away from you as your swing your leg. \n5. Make contact in between the laces and the instep, in what I call the \"Inside Laces.\"\n\nIntro Song: \nPhantom Sage - Away (feat.

Bulgarian Split Squat: 4 sets of 20 reps each leg\n2. Pistol Squat: 3 sets of 5 each leg\n3. Supermans: 3 sets of 25 reps \n4. Table Rows: 4 sets of 15\n5. L-Sits: 4 sets until failure\n6.

Handstand Push Ups: 3 sets of 5 reps\n\nThis is a great workout for anyone looking to become more athletic and build strength when you do not have access to a gym. I always recommend using a gym over bodyweight training as it has been proven to be more effective in building lean muscle and increasing strength. \n\nHowever, I recognize that many of you do not have access to a fully functional gym and therefore like seeing these workouts. I think this is a good mix of exercises to hit all the important areas that are so necessary in the game of football/soccer.",

      "description": "The Become Elite beginner's guide to performing the basic foot stall!\n\nA foot stall is a freestyle trick where you balance the ball on top of your laces. This move can be done either when picking up the ball off of a roll or can be caught out of the air while juggling. The higher the ball is dropped from the more difficult this trick is. \n\nThis guide will teach you the fundamentals of how to stall the soccer ball on your foot\n\nOverview:\n1. Raise your foot off of the ground and relax your toes. They should not be flexed up, nor down. \n2. Allow the ball to fall and hit the top of your toe box. \n3. If your toes are relaxed you will cushion the ball so that it doesn't bounce upwards or off your foot.\n4. Flex your toes upwards, to get the ball to roll back on to your laces.\n5. Continue to squeeze your toes upwards to hold the ball in place between your shin and laces. \n6. Balance the ball, by moving side to side. \n\n..............................................................................................................................................................\n\nVisit our website for customized soccer training programs, official Become Elite t-shirts, workouts, and much more.\n\nInstagram: @Become_Elite\nWebsite: www.become-elite.com",

Start with alternating, below knee juggles.\n2. When ready, hit the ball on the side to produce a slight side spin and hit it just below waist height.\n3. As you do so, continue your path inwards and upwards.\n4. When the ball is at it's highest point, your leg should be completely over the ball.\n5. Quickly bring your foot back under the ball on the opposite side, slow your foot, and catch it before it hits the ground.\n6. Make sure to practice!\n\nLearning Overview:\n1. Start by just practicing the side sweeping kick to get used to continuing your trajectory upwards after a juggle.\n2. Practice what I call Half-Around the World's off the bounce.\n3. Start trying to quicken your Around the World, so that there is no need for a bounce.\n4.

      "description": "Become Elite's Top Three Soccer/Football Dribbling Moves Every Player Should Master\n\nThe Stepover:\nThe stepover is great move when you have space and want to go 1v1 against a defender.\n1. Approach the defender straight on so that you can go either way around him/her.\n(If you want to go to the right, keep the ball on the left side of your body.)\n2. When you get about 3-4 feet away from your defender start to perform the move.\n3. Swing your left leg in front of the ball and plant it on the left side of the ball.\n5. Dip your shoulders down and to the left to get the defender thinking you are going that way.\n6. Push out the ball 45 degrees to the right using the outside of your right foot.\n7. Switch the feet if you want to go the other way.\n\nDrag and Go:\nThe Drag and Go is a great move when in slightly tighter space and when you are not running at full speed at a defender. \n1. Approach the defender as you normally would so that you could go either way around him. \n2. Angle your body so that you are almost sideways. One shoulder should be pointed at the defender and the other almost behind you.\n3. Drag the ball with the inside of your trailing foot, all your weight should be on your front foot.\n4. Take a few small steps and when ready dip your shoulders and explode the opposite direction.\n5. Push the ball with the outside of your trail foot.\n\nMaradona:\nThe Maradona is a move to get out of an oncoming 50-50 tackle, it should not be done as a 1v1 move!\n1. The ball should be about equidistant from you and the defender, hence the 50-50 tackle scenario.\n2. Quickly approach the ball and get there before the defender does.\n3. Pull the ball back with your right foot away from the defender.\n4. As you do this start turning backside left so that your back shoulder is leading the spin. \n5. Simultaneously, plant your right foot and sweep the ball with your left foot to continue your spin\n6. You should almost make a full rotation with your body and now be past the defender. \n7. Explode off into space\n\n\n..............................................................................................................................................................\n\nVisit our website for customized soccer training programs, official Become Elite t-shirts, workouts, and much more.\n\nInstagram: @Become_Elite\nWebsite: www.become-elite.com",

All the best soccer/football players in the world know how to consistently keep the ball up.\n\nThis guide will teach you the fundamentals of how to juggle the soccer ball.\n\nOverview:\n1. There are two ways to juggle the ball using your feet; with the laces and with the toe box.\n2. When juggling with the laces, kick out your foot, point your toes, and hit the ball directly square off of your laces so that the ball pops straight up in the air.\n3. When juggling with your toe box, keep the ball closer to your body, instead of kicking out, lift up your knee slightly, and make contact on top of your toes squarely in the center of the ball.\n4. In either method, try to keep the ball at a consistent height and tempo so that it is easier to control and continue juggling.\n\n..............................................................................................................................................................\n\nVisit our website for customized soccer training programs, official Become Elite t-shirts, workouts, and much more.\n\nInstagram: @Become_Elite\nWebsite: www.become-elite.com",
