Rest of the files in kebab-case.\n- Prefix component names with their type (e.g. ButtonAccount.jsx and ButtonSignin.jsx, CardAnalyticsMain.jsx and CardAnalyticsData.jsx, etc.)\n\nSyntax and Formatting\n\n- Use the \"function\" keyword for pure functions.\n- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.\n- Use declarative JSX.\n\nUI and Styling\n\n- Use DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS for components and styling.\n- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.\n\nPerformance Optimization\n\n- Minimize 'use client', 'useState', and 'useEffect'; favor React Server Components (RSC).\n- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.\n- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.\n- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.\n\nKey Conventions\n\n- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).\n- Limit 'use client':\n  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.\n  - Use only for Web API access in small components.\n  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.\n  - If absolutely necessary, you can use 'swr' library for client-side data fetching.\n- When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the \"use client\" directive at the top of the file.\n- Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.\n\nDesign:\n- For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.\n- Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.\n\n------\n\nI was fired everywhere so I built startups.\n🔗 All my 25+ startups — https://marclou.com\n🧑‍💻 Learn to code in weeks, not months — https://CodeFa.st\n⚡️ Ship your startup in days, not weeks — https://ShipFa.st\n📈 Grow your startup with actionable data — https://DataFa.st\n💡 Everything I know as a solo entrepreneur — https://marclou.com/newsletter\n📸 Instagram —  https://www.instagram.com/marclouvion/\n💼 LinkedIn —  https://www.linkedin.com/in/marclouvion/\n🐦  Twitter — https://twitter.com/marc_louvion\n\n\n00:00 — AI startup\n00:40 — AI stack overview\n01:00 — My AI setup\n01:40 — Inline AI instructions\n02:24 — Chat\n04:04 — Composer\n05:13 — Design\n06:43 — Tips\n08:51 — time to build your startup",
