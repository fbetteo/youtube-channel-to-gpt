You'll always play it safe.  You'll get rid of the ball too soon.  You'll hide instead of making runs and demanding the ball.  You'll never attack.\n\nYou need to embrace mistakes as part of your soccer journey to excellence.",

      "description": "One of the most underrated ball mastery moves is the simple toe touch or toe tap.  It's one of the first \"moves\" taught and is usually used as a warm up for other moves.\n\nNow, I don't think there is anything wrong with using simple toe touches first in a ball mastery session.  However, I believe toe touches are much more important than just as a warm up.\n\nThey seem really simple so not a lot is put into them.  But just like juggling, toe touches are really important in developing a player's touch.  In order to keep the ball still while doing the most basic toe touches while standing still, you need a soft touch. \n\nMany times you'll see the ball move too much because the touch is heavy, or the player isn't even touching the ball at all.\n\nAnd that doesn't even include toe touch skills that involve moving the ball.\n\nDon't just do toe touches.  Master them.\n\nHere's a soccer skills session with six different moves based around toe touches.  There are many, many more.  Many players will think they are too advanced for toe touches.  I don't believe that's ever true.\n\nGive it a shot.  How about 300, 400, 500 or more touches per move?  Or take a time, such as 15 or 20 minutes and see how many touches you can get?  Switch moves every minute.  Rest when you need to.\n\nToe Touches\nDouble Scissors / Toe Touches\nBrazilian Toe Touches\nSide to Side Toe Touches\nBells / Toe Touches\nToe Touches Forward / Backward\n\nPlease consider subscribing to my You Tube channel.  Only 840 more subscribers needed until You Tube considers me a real channel!  Ha!  Thanks in advance!",

For example, on day 2 for beginner you can do each pattern for 100 touches and then go through them again for 50 touches each.  For day 2 of elite, you can do 2 rounds of 150 touches or 3 rounds of 100 touches each.\n\nRemember, practice the pattern so you know it without having to think about it.  If you have to stop and think, you'll prevent yourself from increasing your speed.\n\nGet it right first.  Don't rush speed.  As you get it right, you can increase your speed.  When you start messing up a lot, slow it back down.  Over time (not one session), you'll do it correctly at a faster speed.\n\nThe reason we do this is muscle memory.  If you try and go faster than you can your body is going to learn to do it incorrectly.  But if you never challenge yourself to get faster, you'll never get faster.  It's a balance.",
