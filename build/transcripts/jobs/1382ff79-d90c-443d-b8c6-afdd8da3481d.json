When you pass you are 'pressing' the next man to force them to take their first touch off line before playing to the next player.\n\nThis progresses into two-touch or one-touch, giving the players a decision on which is best to take.\n\nRyan gives the players plenty of opportunities to 'fix' and solve problems. He lets the session play giving players the chance to organise and lead from within the session.\n\nRyan moves onto a different passing and receiving practice, the next activity forces the player to step out to receive the ball, practice adding disguise to their movements to receive.\n\nThe final progression sees the players again playing short quick combinations off 1 and two touches in the technical practice.\n\n\u25ba Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2KZs3wg \n\u25ba Coach Development Package discount, Virtual Conference + Elite Coaching Level 2 for \u00a3210 (\u00a390 discount) with code: CoachDev23\n\u25ba WATCH THE MyPersonalFootballCoach VIRTUAL CONFERENCE: Learn from 14  specialists who have worked in and developed players for the top divisions and clubs around the world https://mypersonalfootballcoach.com/virtual-conference-2022/\n\u25ba Check out the courses for coaches here: https://mypersonalfootballcoach.com/iamacoach/\n\nTo keep up to date with me on the move, you can find me on; Twitter - https://twitter.com/MyFootballCoach \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/myfootballcoach1/?hl=en\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/mypersonalfootballcoach\n\nStay tuned by subscribing to the channel and keep updated your knowledge with top-class professionals.\n\n Master The Ball Master The Game.\n\n#soccercoaching #footballcoaching #soccer #football #coaching #footballskills #soccertraining #footballtraining",

Players were exposed to lots of opportunities to emergency defend around the box, looking to block shots and crosses.\n\nPlayers had to develop their transition from attacking to defending quickly and think about what happens if they lose the ball in this area of the pitch, are they in a position to stop a counter-attack, how can they support their team in and out of possession?

This is a high-intensity session, great for a\u00a0high load day, and also ties into Br\u00f8ndby's pressing philosophy to\u00a0have a tactical element too.\n\nPhase 1: The goal is for the attacker to get into the scoring zone to score, if the defender can win the ball can they counter-attack the opposite end.\n\nPhase 2: Both players start at the same end, the attacker must cross the scoring line to turn and attack the goals where he came from. This challenges the attacking player to free up space to turn and then attack the defender 1v1.\n\nThis sessions bring out quality technical 1v1 and physical outcomes while working on both players speed and turning skills, and gives them different scenarios to play.\n\n\u25ba Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2KZs3wg \n\u25ba Coach Development Package discount, Virtual Conference + Elite Coaching Level 2 for \u00a3210 (\u00a390 discount) with code: CoachDev23\n\u25ba WATCH THE MyPersonalFootballCoach VIRTUAL CONFERENCE: Learn from 14  specialists who have worked in and developed players for the top divisions and clubs around the world https://mypersonalfootballcoach.com/virtual-conference-2022/\n\u25ba Check out the courses for coaches here: https://mypersonalfootballcoach.com/iamacoach/\n\nTo keep up to date with me on the move, you can find me on; Twitter - https://twitter.com/MyFootballCoach \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/myfootballcoach1/?hl=en\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/mypersonalfootballcoach\n\nStay tuned by subscribing to the channel and keep updated your knowledge with top-class professionals.\n\n Master The Ball Master The Game.\n\n#soccercoaching #footballcoaching #soccer #football #coaching #footballskills #soccertraining #footballtraining",

The coach split the group into 2, the assistant taking the other and ran this session. You could easily do the same if you were coaching by yourself, just have the pitches side by side.\nThe set up and the rules are simple. The coach allowed a pass through one of the gates to score. I was thinking it would be a good progression to insist on dribbling through one of the gates.\nThe coach eventually progressed this to a 2v2, in the same space. The players really had to work hard off the ball to support the player in possession.\nAs you will see from the video, there are lots of excellent outcomes in this session as the boys use their dribbling skills and turns to beat the defenders. To give you an idea of the how this session sat in the bigger picture, the coach progressed this into 5v5s and then a 10v10 at the end. This was a really good example of using Small Sided Games (SSG\u2019s) to stagger a session and get lots of quality technical outcomes. \n\n\u25ba Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2KZs3wg \n\u25ba Coach Development Package discount, Virtual Conference + Elite Coaching Level 2 for \u00a3210 (\u00a390 discount) with code: CoachDev23\n\u25ba WATCH THE MyPersonalFootballCoach VIRTUAL CONFERENCE: Learn from 14  specialists who have worked in and developed players for the top divisions and clubs around the world https://mypersonalfootballcoach.com/virtual-conference-2022/\n\u25ba Check out the courses for coaches here: https://mypersonalfootballcoach.com/iamacoach/\n\nTo keep up to date with me on the move, you can find me on; Twitter - https://twitter.com/MyFootballCoach \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/myfootballcoach1/?hl=en\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/mypersonalfootballcoach\n\nStay tuned by subscribing to the channel and keep updated your knowledge with top-class professionals.\n\n Master The Ball Master The Game.\n\n#soccercoaching #footballcoaching #soccer #football #coaching #footballskills #soccertraining #footballtraining",

      "description": "Welcome to Episode 1 of Inside The Academy - the brainchild of MyPersonalFootballCoach's Saul Isaksson-Hurst. In this episode Ex Chelsea & Tottenham academy coach Saul explores the academy set up at Salford City FC. Salford City FC is the football club owned by the Class of 92 - Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes & Nicky Butt. \n\nSalford City FC were promoted to the National League this year after a fantastic season. Obviously the Class of 92 were prime examples of why academies can be so successful for football clubs, no matter how big or small. With the influence of such successful academy products, Saul wanted to see how Salford City FC were developing their stars of the future. In this documentary there are interviews with the coaches, players and even Chris Casper.\n\nThis is the first of many Inside The Academy documentaries and it's not one to be missed.\n\n \u25ba Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/2KZs3wg\n\u25ba Train like the pro's with the #1 online soccer training program.
