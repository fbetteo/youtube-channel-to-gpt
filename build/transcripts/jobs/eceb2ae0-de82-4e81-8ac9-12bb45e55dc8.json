      "description": "Welcome back to Project Footballer, the voice of youth football. If your child is pursuing professional football, you probably understand that statistically most academy kids don't play in the Premier League or even the championship if they do get paid to play football.\n\nStatistically, most academy players play in the lower leagues. So as a parent pursuing professional football for your child, you really do need to know what lower league football is like. In. this episode, we speak to three players who play for Scunthorpe United. You learn about their journeys into football. We explain about the lower league structure, the type of football that's played in the National League and that the average wage of a National League player is \u00a336,000 per year.\n\nEstablished in 1899, turning professional in 1912 and being admitted into the league in 1950, Scunthorpe United lost their EFL status after 72 years in 2022. Now on the upward curve under new ownership led by local fans is determined to return the club to its former glory and sustain and stabilise it for generations to come after its very existence was put at risk. For your chance to support Scunthorpe on this exciting new endeavour please visit their website. https://www.scunthorpe-united.co.uk. You can support in many ways whether it\u2019s buying a shirt, cup or even a sign up to the clubs lottery draw. In a clubs time of need the footballing community support can be all the difference. Every penny helps. #UTI",

      "description": "Perry Mitchel is the father of Khalil, one of the top U9 players in the UK. This is a fascinating interview in which we learn the sacrifice and dedication it takes to develop a player like Khailil. Press-ups and burpees before bed, non-negotiable bed times, speaking to Khalil like a grown up from a young age, ice baths, hill runs and a ban on fizzy drinks are just some of the methods which have led to Khalil achieving such high levels of ability.",
