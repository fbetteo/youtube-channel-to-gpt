Emerging research suggests they might. In this video, we dive into a groundbreaking study published in Cell Metabolism that reveals the surprising link between the microbiome and mental health.\n\nScientists discovered that people with depression often have lower levels of homo-vanillic acid (HVA), a dopamine-related neurotransmitter, along with fewer gut microbes that produce it. In animal models, replenishing either specific gut bacteria (Bifidobacterium longum and Roseburia intestinalis) or HVA consistently reduced depressive symptoms.\nWe\u2019ll explore the science behind the gut-brain connection, why HVA is important for mental health, and how probiotics, fermented foods, and tyrosine-rich foods can support mental health. While this is not medical advice, it opens an exciting frontier in psychiatry and emphasizes the profound link between your gut and brain health. Treat the gut, and you may also be helping the mind.\n\nLearn more about how treating your gut could positively impact your mind.

Part of this misunderstanding stems from a common stereotype: saturated fats are often lumped together as a single entity, when in fact, they are a diverse group of fatty acids. In this video, I\u2019m going to prove the point by reviewing scientific data showing how one specific saturated fat, stearic acid, positively influences fat metabolism and increases fat burning at the mitochondrial level.\n\nI\u2019ll also provide you with a broader framework to understand these findings and general principles of nutrition, while giving you practical takeaways that will help you make better dietary choices. These tips include where to source this beneficial fat in your diet, and I\u2019ll explore its other health benefits, such as reducing visceral fat, lowering blood pressure, and even fighting colon cancer.

Some influencers are eating up to 800 grams of sugary carbs per day! But they\u2019re reporting fat loss. It sounds crazy, but a new scientific study sheds light on how this could work for some people. And, at the same time, it debunks the sugar diet. After watching this video, you\u2019ll understand more about the sugar diet, hormonal balance, fat cell metabolism, and how the sugar diet is actually similar to extreme ketogenic diets.

Interestingly, while it appears protein restriction on a 4:1 ketogenic diet (90% fat) increases FGF-21 in animals, data in humans aren\u2019t as compelling. However, based on the available data, it\u2019s reasonable to speculate this may be in part because ketogenic are classically associated with weight loss and may simultaneously increase FGF-21 sensitivity via upregulation of \u03b2-klotho and other receptors and components of FGF-21 signaling pathways.

That might sound wild\u2014but it\u2019s actually the central thesis of a new paper published in Nature which proposes that many autoimmune diseases, if not all of them, may be driven by the failure of a relationship that began 2 billion years ago: the one between your body and your mitochondria. \nIn this video, I\u2019ll break down mitochondrial dysfunction, how it might be the root cause of autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes. I\u2019ll also give you a list of practical health tips for boosting mitochondrial health. Whether you\u2019re dealing with autoimmune disease or just want to understand how mitochondrial failure could be impacting your health, this video has you covered!\n\nFor all references, please see the associated StayCurious Newsletter.

      "description": "Visceral Fat is the worst type of fat. It\u2019s the fat that sits around your internal organs, promotes inflammation, and is specifically linked to poor cardiovascular and metabolic health. If you want to burn a particular type of fat, it\u2019s visceral fat. In this video we walk through a Randomized Controlled Trial comparing 3 diets and highlight one particular Low-Carbohydrate Mediterranean-style diet that appears especially effective at burning away visceral fat. We also discuss foods containing compounds that might give you an edge over visceral fat to optimize your metabolic health.\n \nChapters\n0:00 \u2013 Eviscerate Visceral Fat!\n0:58 \u2013 Randomized Control Trial, Methods\n2:55 \u2013 Randomized Control Trial, Results \n4:02 \u2013 Breaking Down the Mechanisms\n6:18 \u2013 Polyphenols, Hippuric Acid and Urolithin A\n7:40 \u2013 You Are an Individual!\n7:50 \u2013 Closing Thoughts\n\nStudy:  Zelicha H. et al. The effect of high-polyphenol Mediterranean diet on visceral adiposity: the DIRECT PLUS randomized controlled trial. BMC Med 2022. PMID: 36175997\n\nGlossary of Terms (Alphabetical):\n\n- Benzoic Acid: A simple naturally occurring compound and precursor(s) to Hippuric Acid.\n\n- Brown/Beige Fat: Type of fat tissue that burn calories as heat due to uncoupling of mitochondria. This is called \u201cthermogenesis.\u201d The difference between Brown and Beige fat has to do with their precursor cells. Brown fat has a different precursor than typical \u201cwhite\u201d (energy storage) fat, whereas Beige fat comes from the white fat lineage and develops increased capacity to promote thermogenesis and burn energy as heat. \n\n- Ellagitannins: A diverse group of polyphenols, and precursor(s) to Urolithin A.\n\n- Hippuric Acid: A glycine derivative of benzoic acid that is made by gut bacteria and associated with more microbiome diversity.\n\n- Subcutaneous Fat: Fat that's stored under the skin and can be pinched.\n\n- Urolithin A: An \u201canti-obesity\u201d agent that can increase energy expenditure by increasing thermogenesis in brown/beige fat. Urolithin A is not found directly in food but is made by gut microbes from ellagitannins.\n\n- Visceral Fat: Fat stored around organs that\u2019s inflammatory and contributes to poor metabolic health, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease.\n\n- Wolffia Globosa, Duckweed: The smallest known flowering plant (0.004\u20130.008 inches in diameter) that \u2013 interestingly \u2013 contains B12 and protein and being studied for space agriculture. \n\nNutritional Guide\n\nThe original plan was to create a printable one-page guide to go with this video. Unfortunately, upon deeper review, there weren\u2019t consistent data on the specific Ellagitannin, Hippuric Acid, and Benzoic Acid contents of particular foodstuffs. Urolithin A isn\u2019t found in food naturally. Therefore, below are listed foods by relative content of a given nutrient, understanding there is decent variation ever for a specific food item.\n\nEllagitannins\n- Berries, especially cloudberries, artic bramble, raspberries, strawberries, and sea buckthorn. Note: High latitude berries, e.g. cloudberries and artic bramble, appear to be particularly rich in ellagitannins\n- Other fruit: Pomegranate \n- Nuts: Walnuts are highest in ellagitannins, followed by Hazelnuts, Pecans and Almonds.\n- Teas: Green teas and Cistus incanus tea, particularly from Turkey, Albania, and Greece\n- Wine: Particularly Blackberry wine made with Andean blackberries. Some have ellagitannins contents as high as ~1200 mg/L.\n\nHippuric Acid and/or Benzoic Acid (benzoic acid is converted into hippuric acid)\n- Berries: Including bilberries, strawberries, raspberries, and cloudberries. Note: The highest benzoic acid appears to be the Scottish Strawberry, with ~1300 mg/kg benzoic acid.\n- Dairy Products: Cheese and Yogurts contain benzoic acid. Note: Fermented dairy and blue cheeses have additional probiotic benefits.\n\nThis guide was composed with help from Consensus AI.

Sometimes, I\u2019ll just eat it with a spoon like other people eat peanut butter.\n\nKeto Gravy: https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/lchf/ultimate-keto-gravy \n\nManchego Stuffed Mushrooms. Baby Bella work best for display purposes. Just pre-heat the oven and pop out the stems so the caps of the baby bella\u2019 makes a nice little vessel for your stuffing. Then, in a food processor, blend Manchego cheese with thyme or rosemary and salt. Stuff the mushroom caps then crumble on bacon and brush heavily with melted ghee or avocado oil. Really, this will work with most cheeses, but I find Manchego a crowd pleaser.\n\nCaesar Dressing. There are several ways to work this. I started, initially, with Martina\u2019s recipe, here: https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/lchf/low-carb-caesar-salad-dressing. I ended up modifying it to my preferences, swapping the classic parmesan for tangy feta and using macadamia oil as the primary fat source. But don\u2019t skimp on the anchovies.\n\nDesserts\n\nBrownie Fat Bomb: https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/lchf/keto-chocolate-brownie-truffles \n\nCherry Garcia Keto Ice Cream: https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/lchf/low-carb-cherry-garcia-ice-cream-ice-cream\n\nChocolate Keto Ice Cream: https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/lchf/ultimate-keto-chocolate-ice-cream \n\nRum Raisin Keto Ice Cream: https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/lchf/no-churn-keto-rum-and-raisin-ice-cream \n\nI find the keto ice creams work great when made with RxSugar Allulose Syrups.

      "description": "Layne Norton prides himself on being the \u201cBS crusher.\u201d But what happens when his own BS gets crushed? Maybe the predator is more prey than he realized. But this will NOT be your typical response video. Instead, I want to reflect on what lessons Layne Norton, inadvertently, taught me. I\u2019d also like to highlight that I offered to Layne \u2013 publicly, on X - that I wouldn\u2019t release this video if he was willing to engage with me in a thoughtful manner, rather than &h!t posting, blocking and running. I gave him 48 hours. He failed to step up. He came looking for this fight, only to have his own BS crushed. Of course, I am still very willing to bury the hatchet. However, that would require a show of humility from Layne. I wonder if that will happen. And, I also have a Zero Tolerance Policy for Bullies.\n\nFor those who want to know why I released this video now, see this thread: https://x.com/nicknorwitz/status/1860384376321638436\n\nPrior reaction video to Layne Norton: https://youtu.be/yiq67wpUhIs \n\nChapters \n0:00 \u2013 The Purpose of This Video\n0:57 \u2013 History between myself and Layne Norton\n2:28 \u2013 Layne does poor job covering Lean Mass Hyper-Responder data \n5:22 \u2013 Layne quits on me\n5:59 \u2013 Simon corrects Layne\u2019s error on protein study\n7:06 \u2013 What we learn from this case study\n8:36 \u2013 What is a Functional Foe?\n9:45 \u2013 Three Criteria for Social Media Fighting",

      "description": "Eddie Hall, who won the World\u2019s Strongest Man in 2017 and who set the world Deadlift at 1102 lbs (500kg) has started a carnivore diet! In this video, I\u2019ll breakdown what Eddie eats, explain how he\u2019s losing weight on 10,000 Calories per day, discuss loose stools on carnivore, and more. \n\nAmendments\n(i) On the solid vs liquid butter mini-experiment, people have noted butter will melt at body temperature. Of course, this is true. However, it's also true of all common fat sources, including tallow, lard and coconut oil. The idea is to control for fatty acids; thus, a comparison of olive oil versus ribeye steak would not be a good way to test the solid/liquid effect. There are alternatives, e.g. ribeye steak vs lean filet plus melted tallow; although even this is complicated by the fact the variable of distinction is the food matrix, more than the solid/liquid state. It's possible - maybe probable - that I misunderstood Shawn in our conversation and he meant that fatty meat, which is solid, will empty out of the stomach more slowly than pure fat, which is liquid or liquid at human body temperature. If this is the case, there are other ways one could test the gastric emptying rate idea, e.g. with medications that slow gastric emptying like GLP-1RA. Personally, my money is on more of an electrolyte, microbiome purge and/or fatty acid effect. But, clearly, it's highly individual.\n\n(ii) Some people have commented that Eddie is now using Fiber supplements. For this video, I reviewed the two videos he'd posted on his carnivore diet (the initial one, and the first 30 days video). In neither of those did he mention taking fiber. So, if I omitted this detail, it was unintentional \n\nIf you love macadamia like me - or want to try the best macadamia products on the planet ( (and maybe dipping cheese in macadamia butter, at video timestamp - 5:03) - below it my affiliate link to House of Macadamia.

      "description": "Keto is more than just cutting carbs. It\u2019s about entering a unique metabolic state where your body produces ketones, powerful molecules that can play a critical role in fighting cancer. Specifically, the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate has been shown to inhibit key enzymes and pathways that cancer cells rely on for growth. This isn\u2019t just about removing carbs from your diet; it\u2019s about adding a metabolic state that could reshape cancer metabolism. I will break down the science, concisely and in a way that\u2019s easy to understand. #Cancer #Metabolism #Ketodiet #mTOR\n\nPaper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-024-01093-w \n\nChapters\n0:00 \u2013 Keto is a Powerful Metabolic State\n1:33 \u2013 New Paper \n2:49 \u2013 Ketone Bodies Block Cancer Metabolism\n3:50 \u2013 Conclusion",

I\u2019ve been a heavy user of highly satiating macadamia nuts for over 5 years since I started a ketogenic diet. They\u2019re delicious, versatile, high MUFA, high Omega-7/Palmitoleic Acid, low Omega-6/Linoleic acid, and low oxalate, phytate and lectin.\n\nTo try product from my favorite nut company, HouseOfMacadamia, Go To:\nhttp://partner.houseofmacadamias.com/nick-norwitz\n- 15% Off All Bundles \n- 10% off any item (non-bundle) with code \"NICK10\"\n\nAnd for more information on macadamia nutrition and Omega-7: https://youtu.be/Vngn6i-rmZI\n\nI'm also on the scientific advisory board at RxSugar, a company that specializes in allulose. Unlike macadamia - which I do consume regularly - I don't have much of a sweet tooth so don't find I have much of a need for allulose. However, I always try my best to separate my personal preferences from the science, which is why I'm happy and proud to support RxSugar and their mission to displace fructose and sugar in the food supply with allulose! Among allulose's interesting properties is that it induces the release of endogenous GLP-1, albeit at lower dose equivalencies than prescription medications. Still, there are data (clinical and preclinical) that allulose can have anti-obesogenic properties. And the precise mechanism is being explored actively! There are also clinical reports of people have loss of cravings and \"food noise\" with allulose products, which is interesting. I wonder if one could measure a change in DMH pre-ingestion satiation neurons after an allulose bolus... perhaps we will find out in time! \n\nYou can use my discount code NICK20 for 20% off any products.\nhttps://rxsugar.com\n\nFor more scientific information on allulose, go here: https://youtu.be/pr93EsEV2bM",

No meds! https://youtu.be/-HZEjnw4WTs\n \nSupplemental Table 5 Lists Lipid Levels for the whole LCHF cohort of 2,034 participants. LDL-C levels were 3.71 mmol/l vs 3.62 mmol/l in the SD group. That\u2019s a difference of 0.09, which can be converted to mg/dl by multiplying by 38.67. 0.09 * 38.67 = 3.48 mg/dl. Absolute mean levels of ApoB were 1.06 g/L and 1.03 g/L in the LCHF and SD groups, respectively.\n\nFor interest - and because I know the question will arise - TG mean levels in the LCHF cohort were 133 mg/dl in the LCHF group and 137 mg/dl in the SD group.\n\nA point I do not make in the video regarding the JACC Advances paper, but that's worth considering, is that when they restrict analysis to subjects who completed at least 2 dietary questionnaires (Supplemental Table 7C), covering at least 2 days of eating (rather than 1), between group significance disappears, p = 0.34 (aHR CI: 0.49 - 8.14). This is likely due to decrease in power, but is nevertheless notable.  \n\nWith respect to my comment on the macronutrient profile of a Burger King Whopper and Fries, Nutritionix lists the following macronutrient profile(s):\n\nWhopper: 680 kCal, 40g fat, 55g total carbohydrate, 4g fiber, 35g protein\nMedium Fries: 328 kCal, 15g fat, 45g total carbohydrate, 3.4g fiber, 3.8g protein\n\nMath:\n55g fat * 9 Cal/g + 92.6g net carbohydrate*4 Cal/g + 38.8g protein*4 Cal/g = \n495 Cal fr Fat + 370.4 Cal fr Carbs + Cal + 155.2 Cal fr Pro\n\n%Cal Carbs using Cal reported = 370.4 Cal / (1008 Cal) = 36.7%\n* using the Cal sum from macros, which can and usually do vary slightly, the denominator is adjusted to 1020.6 Cal, and the %Cal Carbs is 36.3%\n\nReferences\nIatan I et al.

Also, their latin name is Balaenoptera musculus, which means - roughly - winged whale and mouse, respectively... which may be a pun by Carl Linnaeus when he named the species.\n\n0:00 - Intro, New Study!\n0:47 - Metabolic Psychiatry \n2:22 - Study, Metabolic and Mental Health\n5:01 - Closing, Thank You.

If you like roasted nuts, I suggesting using temperatures at or below 265 - 285 F (130 - 140 C) for 20 minutes. The temperature sensitivity of nuts derives from their fragile omega-6 fats. But because macadamia nuts are low in omega-6, they are more stable. Even at 150 \u00b0C/ 300 \u00b0F, macadamia are okay. In fact, if you roast equal amounts of macadamia and walnuts at 300 F, the macadamia will end up with 1/30th the oxidized fats (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25766804/).",

Technically, causality isn't proven. However, it's important to keep in mind that (1) You can't do an RCT on this topic with hard outcomes... you can't randomize a group a humans to microplastics exposure and then monitor for the outcomes of heart attack, stroke and death. (2) These data are consistent with prior work and have biological plausibility, i.e. there are data that microplastics can induce an inflammatory and immune response, signs of which we also see in this paper with the increase in immune cell activation markers and inflammatory cytokines (3) In general, the \"cost\" to reducing microplastics is inconvenience at most. If you choose to drink filtered tap water out of your own stainless steel bottle, rather than bottled, at absolute worst you get negligible health benefit and that water bottle doesn't end up in the ocean as pollution. \n\n\nBeat the microbead: https://www.beatthemicrobead.org/guide-to-microplastics/\nPFAS free: https://pfascentral.org/pfas-free-products/\nMy favorite plastic-free tea company: https://yogiproducts.com/all-teas/",

Rosuvastatin (20 mg/d) lowered LDL-C by 32.5% (137 mg/dl). Thus, Oreos were ~2X as potent as high-intensity statin therapy for LDL cholesterol lowering in this LMHR subject.\n\nThe Why: The LMHR phenotype has much to teach us about human metabolism, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology. It's a new frontier that deserves further study, for the sake of the patients with this phenotype and for pure scientific curiosity! This experiment will serve as 'productive provocation,' a form of 'legit-bait' that will hopefully help prompt discussions and larger-scale experiments that need to happen.\n\n6 select Prior publications\n1/ META of RCTs (new, 1/16/24)\nSota-Mota A, Flores-Jurado Y, Norwitz NG, Feldman D, Pereira MA, Danaei G, Ludwig DS.

I agree with the fact that the SAD eating pattern is problematic and that it would be an improvement to eat a whole food-based diet. I also (very much) acknowledge there are non-health related issues about food that we should have adult discussions about.\n\nWhat I didn't like: \n(1) This series wasn't really about the twin study. Data were only presented, a bit, in the last of the 4 episodes. \n(2) The advertised foods (fake meat, fake cheese, fake eggs) are cast as similar/identical, but simply aren't, nor were they the basis of the participant's diets.\n(3) The data presented were, I think, not all that impressive. And some data presented in the documentary could not be found in the paper, e.g. body composition.\n\nFor more on the topic of Data Misrepresentation, see our new paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662372806X?via%3Dihub",
