Typically it is harder for players to understand and perform the movement after they have made a pass. Use this pass and move drill to help them get into the habit of moving into space after they pass. \nThis drill can be used in any shape, and any distance between the cones. The focus of the drill is to have one less player than cones (5 payers to 6 cones for example). The player will pass to a teammate and then move to the free cone. There is a second progression with adding a one-two/wall pass before moving to free cone. \nEnjoy!\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/@KSPerformance?sub_confirmation=1 \n   Thanks for showing your support!\n\n\nEMAIL: ksperformancefootball@gmail.com \n\n\nFOLLOW US\n    Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/KSperformancefootball/ \n    Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ks_performance_football/ \n\n\nPLAYLISTS\n   Rondos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdyn9mzmWtGmmdkLXMCygw88O-eWkTuv7 \n   \n   Passing Drills: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdyn9mzmWtGnxbgLjwgAYDhKflrHXODpu     \n\n   Shooting Drills: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdyn9mzmWtGkYC8l9mgsW9C0mBj1GX8Sr \n  \n   U6, U7, U8, U9 Drills: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdyn9mzmWtGn84H14bCnP0loxWdHq1phL \n\n   Pro Team Drills: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdyn9mzmWtGnB0SBWB1vODDdkT8Eeo68E \n\n\n\n\n\nsoccer, football, training, exercise soccer training, passing exercise soccer, exercise for soccer, exercise for soccer training, soccer warm up exercise, football drills, soccer drills, passing drills, soccer passing, football passing, passing, tiki taka drill, possession drills, training coach, coaching kids, football training, youth football, professional soccer training, youth soccer, youth football, football soccer coaching, professional football training, football rondo, soccer rondo, warm up drills, triangle passing, fitness drills, passing training, shooting drills, finishing drills, how to coach, lifestyle, train, footy, juggle, freestyle, cristiano, messi, offseason, preseason, cardio, stamina, soccer specific",
