Privacy concerns around sending customer and organizational data to OpenAI APIs is a huge issue in AI right now but using local models like GPT4All, LLaMa, Alpaca etc can be a viable alternative. \n\nI did some research and figured out how to make your own version of ChatGPT trained on your own data (PDFs, docs etc) using only open source models like GPT4All which is based on GPT-J or LLaMa depending on the version you use. LangChain has great support for models like these so in this video we use LangChain to integrate LLaMa embeddings with GPT4All and a FAISS local vector database to store out documents.\n\nMentioned in the video:\nCode: https://github.com/wombyz/gpt4all_langchain_chatbots\nGPT4ALL (Pre-Converted): \nhttps://huggingface.co/mrgaang/aira/blob/main/gpt4all-converted.bin\nEmbedding Model: \nhttps://huggingface.co/Pi3141/alpaca-native-7B-ggml/commit/397e872bf4c83f4c642317a5bf65ce84a105786e\nMac User Troubleshooting: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JDMBTOjbRtJo49z1SKEnvfG1a4JQMjWFT7hvfZZU4vQ/edit?usp=sharing\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - What is GPT4All?\n2:28 - Setup & Install\n7:13 - LangChain + GPT4All\n11:42 - Custom Knowledge Query\n19:42 - Chatbot App\n24:19 - My Thoughts on GPT4All",

Being able to chat with large documents (PDFs etc) like this is one of the most exciting opportunities in AI right now.\n\nThe Stoic philosophy (stoicism) has become hugely popular in recent times due to people like Ryan Holiday (author of Daily Stoic, Obstacle is The Way & more). The teachings of ancient philosophers like Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Seneca have been revived and adopted by a new generation of Stoics. AI now offers a revolutionary new way of interacting with their teachings.\n\nThis is just one of the insane new use cases from AI to help people by democratizing mentorship and life coaching.",
