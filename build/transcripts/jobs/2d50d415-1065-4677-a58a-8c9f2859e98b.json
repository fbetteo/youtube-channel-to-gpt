Rest of the files in kebab-case.\n- Prefix component names with their type (e.g. ButtonAccount.jsx and ButtonSignin.jsx, CardAnalyticsMain.jsx and CardAnalyticsData.jsx, etc.)\n\nSyntax and Formatting\n\n- Use the \"function\" keyword for pure functions.\n- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.\n- Use declarative JSX.\n\nUI and Styling\n\n- Use DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS for components and styling.\n- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.\n\nPerformance Optimization\n\n- Minimize 'use client', 'useState', and 'useEffect'; favor React Server Components (RSC).\n- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.\n- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.\n- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.\n\nKey Conventions\n\n- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).\n- Limit 'use client':\n  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.\n  - Use only for Web API access in small components.\n  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.\n  - If absolutely necessary, you can use 'swr' library for client-side data fetching.\n- When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the \"use client\" directive at the top of the file.\n- Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.\n\nDesign:\n- For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.\n- Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.\n\n------\n\nI was fired everywhere so I built startups.\n\ud83d\udd17 All my 25+ startups \u2014 https://marclou.com\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Learn to code in weeks, not months \u2014 https://CodeFa.st\n\u26a1\ufe0f Ship your startup in days, not weeks \u2014 https://ShipFa.st\n\ud83d\udcc8 Grow your startup with actionable data \u2014 https://DataFa.st\n\ud83d\udca1 Everything I know as a solo entrepreneur \u2014 https://marclou.com/newsletter\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram \u2014  https://www.instagram.com/marclouvion/\n\ud83d\udcbc LinkedIn \u2014  https://www.linkedin.com/in/marclouvion/\n\ud83d\udc26  Twitter \u2014 https://twitter.com/marc_louvion\n\n\n00:00 \u2014 AI startup\n00:40 \u2014 AI stack overview\n01:00 \u2014 My AI setup\n01:40 \u2014 Inline AI instructions\n02:24 \u2014 Chat\n04:04 \u2014 Composer\n05:13 \u2014 Design\n06:43 \u2014 Tips\n08:51 \u2014 time to build your startup", "channelId": "UC12JO2IPlEViR-o6SLXKx1A", "channelTitle": "Marc Lou", "publishedAt": "2025-03-10T13:15:10Z", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fFzcL6Ivqz0/maxresdefault.jpg", "duration": "9:31", "viewCount": 34979, "likeCount": 1577, "commentCount": 96, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFzcL6Ivqz0"}, "D1BjJB-n9lg": {"id": "D1BjJB-n9lg", "title": "I made these 10 SaaS (and earned $237,631)", "description": "I'll show you my SaaS, the revenue, how to get customers, and how to find startup ideas.\nFree step-by-step course to learn to code an ENTIRE SaaS startup in 3 hours: https://youtu.be/QD50Pkf0Ov0\n\n------\n\nI was fired everywhere so I built startups.\n\ud83d\udd17 All my 25+ startups \u2014 https://marclou.com\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Learn to code in weeks, not months \u2014 https://CodeFa.st\n\u26a1\ufe0f Ship your startup in days, not weeks \u2014 https://ShipFa.st\n\ud83d\udcc8 Grow your startup with actionable data \u2014 https://DataFa.st\n\ud83d\udca1 Everything I know as a solo entrepreneur \u2014 https://marclou.com/newsletter\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram \u2014  https://www.instagram.com/marclouvion/\n\ud83d\udcbc LinkedIn \u2014  https://www.linkedin.com/in/marclouvion/\n\ud83d\udc26  Twitter \u2014 https://twitter.com/marc_louvion\n\n00:00 \u2014 I made ~$2M as a solo developer, but...\n00:34 \u2014 SaaS 1/7\n04:21 \u2014 SaaS 2/7\n07:20 \u2014 SaaS 3/7\n09:36 \u2014 SaaS 4/7\n12:50 \u2014 SaaS 5/7\n16:40 \u2014 SaaS 6/7\n19:19 \u2014 SaaS 7/7\n21:27 \u2014 My 3 inactive SaaS\n22:51 \u2014 3 lessons", "channelId": "UC12JO2IPlEViR-o6SLXKx1A", "channelTitle": "Marc Lou", "publishedAt": "2025-03-03T12:15:01Z", "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D1BjJB-n9lg/maxresdefault.jpg", "duration": "24:33", "viewCount": 39059, "likeCount": 1469, "commentCount": 102, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1BjJB-n9lg"}, "C2Bs_Zu103U": {"id": "C2Bs_Zu103U", "title": "POV: you\u2019re a millionaire developer automating 25 startups with AI", "description": "I was fired everywhere, so I built my own startups.\n\ud83d\udd17 Explore my 25+ startups \u2014 https://marclou.com\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Learn to code in weeks, not months \u2014 https://CodeFa.st\n\u26a1\ufe0f Ship your startup in days, not weeks \u2014 https://ShipFa.st\n\ud83d\udcc8 Grow your startup with actionable data \u2014 https://DataFa.st\n\ud83d\udca1 Everything I know as a solo entrepreneur \u2014 https://marclou.com/newsletter\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram \u2014  https://www.instagram.com/marclouvion/\n\ud83d\udcbc LinkedIn \u2014  https://www.linkedin.com/in/marclouvion/\n\ud83d\udc26  Twitter \u2014 https://twitter.com/marc_louvion\n\n00:00 \u2014 Welcome to my POV\n00:19 \u2014 Barefoot millionaire?
