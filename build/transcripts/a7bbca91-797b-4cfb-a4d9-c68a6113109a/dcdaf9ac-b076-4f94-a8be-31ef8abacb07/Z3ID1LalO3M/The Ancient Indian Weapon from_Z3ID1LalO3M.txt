This ancient deadly Indian weapon comes straight from legend. When spun from the fingertip, its aerodynamic shape allows it to glide through the air with lethal precision. The chakrum is a metal ring with a hollow center designed for gripping as well as sharp outer edges. Thanks to its ricocheting ability and long range effectiveness, it could neutralize enemies from a distance. Yet it was just as deadly in close combat.
