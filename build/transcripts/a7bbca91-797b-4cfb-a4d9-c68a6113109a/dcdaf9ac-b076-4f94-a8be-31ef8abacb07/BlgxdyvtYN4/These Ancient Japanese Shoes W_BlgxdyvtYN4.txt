This is the world's hardest and loudest shoe to walk in. But there's an important reason. Tanguguetta, the traditional Japanese shoes, feature a tall wooden block sole that gives you a graceful upright posture and produces a distinctive click with every step, announcing your presence and steps. This feature was considered both an aesthetic and a sign of social status, as well as a practical solution that kept traditional clothing clean by keeping mud and dirt at bay.
