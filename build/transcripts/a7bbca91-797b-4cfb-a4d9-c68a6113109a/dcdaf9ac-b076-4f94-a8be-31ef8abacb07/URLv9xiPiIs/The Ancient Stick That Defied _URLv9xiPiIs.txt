This ancient wooden stake defied gravity. Known as the shepherd's leap, this technique was used by shepherds in the Canary Islands to move through extreme terrain using long wooden stakes tipped with metal. They used the stake to balance, leap across rugged ground, and even control their descent. Today it survives as both a sport and a cultural tradition.
