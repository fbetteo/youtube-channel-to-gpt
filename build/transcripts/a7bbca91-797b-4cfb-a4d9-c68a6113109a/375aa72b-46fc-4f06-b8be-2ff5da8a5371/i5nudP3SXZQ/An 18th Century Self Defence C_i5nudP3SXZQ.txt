If someone points this cane at you, take it seriously. Although it looks like an ordinary walking stick, it was actually one of the most discreet self-defense weapons of its time. When it first appeared in the 18th century, it used a small amount of gunpowder to fire a single pellet with a simple trigger, making it ideal for the elderly who needed to defend themselves without drawing attention. Later, cartridge loading models emerged, and it became the weapon of choice among the elite for both protection and concealment.
