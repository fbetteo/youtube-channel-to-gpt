Ninjas used traditional ashiko and shuko tools for a deadly advantage. These spiked metal tools strapped to their feet and hands gave them the ability to cling and scratch with ease. They allowed for silent and effortless movement across all types of terrain while also making it incredibly fast to climb trees and walls. In close combat, they made strikes deadlier and even helped deflect katana attacks.
