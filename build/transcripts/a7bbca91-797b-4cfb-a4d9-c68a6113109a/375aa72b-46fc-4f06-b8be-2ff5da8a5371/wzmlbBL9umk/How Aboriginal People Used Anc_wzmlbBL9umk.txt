Ever wondered what ancient boomerangs were really used for by Aboriginal people? Dating back 20,000 years, this curved aerodynamic tool spins through the air at tremendous speed, making it a deadly weapon. Non-turning boomerangs, heavier and straighter, were used to hunt small animals with a direct hit and to injure enemies. Returning ones, lighter in design, were used to quickly herd animals or drive birds into nets.
