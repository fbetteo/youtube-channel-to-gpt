View Count: 75,263

How did ancient people manage to carry heavy loads? Because they were super strong. Not exactly. They used their heads. This strap, usually made of leather and known as a tump line, was tied to the load and placed over the head, transferring the weight through the nape to the spine. Instead of straining the shoulders or lower back, it engaged the strongest part of the body, making carrying easier and more ergonomic.
