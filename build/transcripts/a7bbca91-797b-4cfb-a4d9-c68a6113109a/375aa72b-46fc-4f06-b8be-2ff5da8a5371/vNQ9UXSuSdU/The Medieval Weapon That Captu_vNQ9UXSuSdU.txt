This medieval weapon was used in Europe to capture people without killing them. Known as the man catcher, this brutal device featured a barbed metal ring with inward-facing spikes that trapped the targets limbs and made escape nearly impossible. Its long handle allowed the user to stay at a safe distance while the spikes dug in deeper with every movement.
