Why were the columns of old wooden houses compressed with turnbuckles? This method was essential for strengthening weakened columns and restoring historic buildings. The decayed or damaged section of a column was removed and turnbuckles were installed to compress and lift the remaining structure. This method increased the wood's loadbearing capacity and helped prevent collapse while preserving the building's historical character.
