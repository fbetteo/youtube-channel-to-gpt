How the ancient Japanese weapon Kuseragama defeated swords and changed close combat. This weapon was created by attaching a chain and weight to a sharp sickle. From a distance, the chain wrapped around an enemy's limbs or weapon to throw them off balance while the weight struck to disable them. Then, the sickle delivered a deadly blow up close, making it effective at any range. But its complexity and risk of self-injury kept it from becoming widespread.
