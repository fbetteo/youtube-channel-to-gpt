Here is the death whistle sound from the Aztecs. Initially, this skull-shaped ceramic was mistaken for a simple ornament. But in 1999, someone blew into it and a terrifying cry rang out. Its acoustic design forces air through in a chaotic way, producing a scream-like sound. The tone is so disturbing and intense, it can trigger panic and fear on its own. Aztec warriors are believed to have used it in unison to strike fear into enemies.
