How could ancient humans throw powerful and precise spears so far? This simple yet ingenious tool known as an atlottal has been used since the Stone Age to launch spears using human biomechanics. Made of wood or bone, this hooked tool acts as an extension of the arm, creating a leverage effect that allows the spear to be thrown much farther with greater power and ease.
