How did ancient people send messages across miles without words thousands of years ago? This simple yet effective tool is known as a bull roarer. It usually consists of a thin wooden plate with sharp or serrated edges attached to the end of a rope. When the rope is swung in a circular motion, it rotates due to its aerodynamic shape and produces a characteristic humming or buzzing sound. Being low frequency, this sound can be heard from miles away in quiet environments, making it an effective communication tool.
