This ancient Chinese repeating crossbow is one of the first automatic weapons in history. Dating back to the 4th century BC, this ingenious invention helped defend the Great Wall of China. With its top-mounted magazine and a simple pull handle, it automatically loaded and fired arrows in rapid succession, enabling fast and continuous fire. It transformed defensive warfare by allowing even untrained civilians to respond quickly to threats.
