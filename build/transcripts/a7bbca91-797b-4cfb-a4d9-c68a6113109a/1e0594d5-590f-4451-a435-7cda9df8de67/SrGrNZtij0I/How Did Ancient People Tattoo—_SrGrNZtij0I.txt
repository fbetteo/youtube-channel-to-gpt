How did ancient people carve tattoos into their skin and for what purpose? This painful ritual dates back thousands of years. A sharp bone or thorn needle attached to a wooden handle was tapped into the skin using another stick. The ink came from coal or plant extracts. Tattoos served medical and religious purposes while also often signifying identity and status. The oldest known example belongs to Utsie the Iceman, dating back to 3,300 BC.
