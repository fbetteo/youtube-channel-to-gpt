Before TV and cinema, the Mutoscope was the first personal film device in history. It appeared in nearly every entertainment venue in the late 1800s. Inside, thousands of photo cards were packed into a drum. By turning a crank, users created the illusion of motion, bringing the images to life through a small eyepiece. Each coin operated machine featured a different theme from comedy to pinup girls. With the rise of cinema, it slowly faded into nostalgia.
