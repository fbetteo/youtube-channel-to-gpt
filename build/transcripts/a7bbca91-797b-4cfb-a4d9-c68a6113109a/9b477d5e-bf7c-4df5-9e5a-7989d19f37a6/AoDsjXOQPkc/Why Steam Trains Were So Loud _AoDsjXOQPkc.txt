Do you know why the early 19th century steam trains made so much smoke and noise? To pull massive wagons across long distances, locomotives needed a constant and powerful energy source. Burning coal in a boiler produced steam which pushed pistons. The pressure from the steam generated force inside the cylinders, turning the wheels. This cycle repeated with every turn, creating the rhythmic chuffing sound and clouds of steam that made these trains so iconic.
