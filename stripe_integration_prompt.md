You, a great software developer and data scientist, will help me set up this API I need for my youtube transcript downloader stripe integration.
The frontend is in another repo in NextJs with Auth using Supabase. That's already implemented.
I have user_credits table that will keep track of credits available. The id is the supabase id.


# Instructions
1) transcript_api.py is the main entry point to the api. I need to create endpoints for the fronted to create a payment for the app. In stripe I have a product with 3 different prices (price_id) for different amount of credits. The API should:
- create the checkout session for the right price
- receive the payment
- add the credits to the user_credits table when payment received (webhook I guess)
- Do all this handling errors gracefully but don't overcomplicating stuff.


2) We need some security implementation for the endpoint (and that we will use for others). Remember we are using supabase google sign in auth, not sure how to validate the users, do we get a jwt? or similar?

3) I have a similar situation in fastapi_main.py so some endpoints that could help guide are there. You will have access to them. Review and use the logic if it's useful to keep consistency but if you find issues or better ways to do things let me know with the corresponding motive.

# Task
You will review the code and instructions and think deeply about the best way to create the API and get all the tasks done. Think about the instructions. No need to code yet. Have in mind instructions and user experience. Formulate more that one approach with pros and cons. Ask any question you need to me.



---- Answer Claude 4 (ask)
I've reviewed your code and requirements. Let me analyze the situation and propose different approaches for implementing the Stripe integration and authentication.

Current State Analysis
From fastapi_main.py, I can see you already have:

JWT validation using Supabase
Stripe checkout session creation
Webhook handling for payment completion
User credit management (though in a users table with remaining_messages)
From transcript_api.py, I see:

Rate limiting for anonymous users
Session management
No authentication currently implemented
Key Questions Before Proceeding
Database Schema: You mentioned a user_credits table, but I see a users table in fastapi_main.py with remaining_messages. Should I:

Create a new user_credits table as mentioned?
Use the existing users table pattern?
What's the relationship between credits and transcript downloads (1 credit = 1 transcript)?
Stripe Products: You mentioned 3 different price IDs for different credit amounts. Can you provide:

The actual price IDs from Stripe?
How many credits each price tier provides?
Authentication Consistency: Should I use the same JWT validation pattern from fastapi_main.py, or do you want a different approach for transcript_api.py?

Proposed Approaches
Approach 1: Unified Authentication & Credit System
Pros:

Consistent with existing fastapi_main.py patterns
Reuse existing JWT validation logic
Single user management system
Cons:

Requires database schema alignment
More complex integration between services
Approach 2: Independent Service with Shared Auth
Pros:

transcript_api.py remains independent
Cleaner separation of concerns
Easier to scale separately
Cons:

Potential code duplication
Need to ensure auth consistency
Approach 3: Hybrid Approach
Pros:

Extract common auth logic to shared module
Each service manages its own features
Balanced complexity
Cons:

Requires refactoring existing code
Recommended Implementation Strategy
I recommend Approach 3 with the following structure:

1. Authentication
Extract JWT validation to a shared auth.py module
Use the same Supabase JWT validation pattern
Implement rate limiting bypass for authenticated users
2. Database Schema
3. Payment Flow
/create-checkout-session endpoint with price tier selection
Stripe webhook to handle payment completion
Automatic credit allocation based on price tier
4. Credit System Integration
Authenticated users consume credits instead of hitting rate limits
Graceful fallback to anonymous rate limiting when credits exhausted
Questions for You
What's your preferred database schema approach?
Can you provide the Stripe price IDs and their corresponding credit amounts?
How many credits should one transcript download cost?
Should authenticated users with 0 credits fall back to the anonymous rate limit, or be blocked entirely?
Do you want to keep the services completely separate or create some shared utilities?
Once you clarify these points, I can provide the specific implementation with proper error handling and security measures.

--- USER
separate approaches, the DB are different. I already have a user_credits table, forget about the fastapi_main table, those are different. user_credits has columns: user_id (uuid) and credits (int4)
price_id: price_1RS4JtCakpeOUC7BNBus3Ns2 - 400 credits
price_id: price_1RS4KSCakpeOUC7B8DnlDcIS - 1000 credits
price_id: price_1RS4QeCakpeOUC7Bvh7kNfd1 - 3000 credits
1 transcript is 1 credit. Even if the download couldn't be done, but one attempt, one credit.
no credits is equal to no download from the full channel, they can still do sinlg eurl downloads and anonymous
all separated, eventually we can see if something is shareable but not for now.

Perfect! Thank you for the clarifications. Now I understand the requirements better. Let me propose a clean implementation for the separated transcript_api.py with Stripe integration and Supabase JWT authentication.

Implementation Plan
1. Database Schema (confirmed)
2. Credit System Logic
1 credit = 1 transcript download attempt (even if it fails)
Authenticated users with credits: Can use all endpoints
Authenticated users with 0 credits: Can only use single URL downloads (anonymous behavior)
Anonymous users: Rate-limited single URL downloads only
3. Price Tiers
price_1RS4JtCakpeOUC7BNBus3Ns2: 400 credits
price_1RS4KSCakpeOUC7B8DnlDcIS: 1000 credits
price_1RS4QeCakpeOUC7Bvh7kNfd1: 3000 credits
4. Endpoints to Add
5. Authentication Strategy
I'll implement Supabase JWT validation similar to your fastapi_main.py but adapted for this service:

6. Credit Consumption Logic
Channel downloads: Require authentication + sufficient credits
Single URL downloads: Available for all (anonymous rate-limited, authenticated credit-based)
Info endpoints: Free for all users
Questions Before Implementation
Database Connection: Should I create a new database connection setup for this service, or do you have a preferred way to connect to the same database?

Environment Variables: I'll need these new variables:

Error Handling for Credit Deduction: Should I deduct credits:

Before the transcript attempt (guaranteed deduction)
After the attempt (only deduct on success)
Based on your requirement "Even if the download couldn't be done, but one attempt, one credit", I assume before is correct?

Webhook Security: Should I add the same project metadata filtering (project: "transcript-api") to distinguish from other services' webhooks?

Once you confirm these details, I'll provide the complete implementation with:

Shared auth utilities
Credit management system
Stripe payment integration
Database operations
Proper error handling and logging
Would you like me to proceed with the implementation once you clarify these points?
