You, a great software developer and data scientist, will help me set up this API I need for my youtube transcript downloader.

# Instructions
1) transcript_api.py was the first attempt using fastapi_retrieve Class. I don't want to use that class anymore because it's used in another project and I don't want to mess anything. Also, it has some bad habits but you should have it at hand to undesrtand how to use the from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi
from youtube_transcript_api.proxies import WebshareProxyConfig libraries.

2) The functionalities (endpoint names) in transcript_api.py are quite ok. I need to download 
* video info
* single video transcripts as fast as possible (no overhead)
* channel info
* all of channel transcripts (or a subset in the future but all for now). Here, it might be useful to have async and parallelization to make it fast. Also, polling will be needed as I have timeout restrictions from the frontend. I want to be able to poll also how many trnascripts have been downloaded so far to keep a progress status to the user. This functionality needs to be fast as possible for user satisfaction but I know it can take longer.


3) Don't create any client. All of this will be called from a frontend but we can talk later about how to try the endpoints with a few commands to understand what's going on and debug.

4) If you think creating a new class is needed for this just say it, it can be different functions. Not sure about that

# Task
You will review the code and instructions and think deeply about the best way to create the API and get all the tasks done. Think about the instructions. No need to code yet. Have in mind instructions and user experience. Formulate more that one approach with pros and cons. Ask any question you need to me.

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationOkay, I've reviewed your instructions and the existing code, particularly focusing on transcript_api.py and the functionalities you want to achieve without using the `fastapi_retrieve.VideoRetrieval` class from fastapi_retrieve.py.

Here's a plan to restructure your API for downloading YouTube transcripts, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and meeting your requirements for asynchronous operations and progress tracking.

**Core Idea:**

We'll create a new service layer, likely a new Python module (e.g., `youtube_service.py`), which will house all the logic for interacting with the YouTube Data API and the `youtube-transcript-api`. The FastAPI endpoints in transcript_api.py will then call functions from this new service layer. This keeps the API endpoint definitions clean and separates concerns.

**Proposed Approaches & Structure:**

You mentioned being open to a new class or functions. Both are viable:

1.  **Service Module with Helper Functions (e.g., `youtube_service.py`):**
    *   **Pros:** Can be simpler for a focused set of functionalities. Easier to test individual functions.
    *   **Cons:** If logic becomes very complex or shares a lot of state/configuration, a class might offer better organization. Job tracking for channel downloads would likely use a module-level dictionary.
    *   **Structure:**
        *   `youtube_service.py`:
            *   Initialization of `googleapiclient.discovery.build` (for YouTube Data API) and `YouTubeTranscriptApi` (with proxy config from `src/config_v2.py`).
            *   Functions like:
                *   `extract_youtube_id(url: str) -> Optional[str]`
                *   `async get_video_info(video_id: str) -> Optional[Dict]`
                *   `async get_channel_info(channel_identifier: str) -> Optional[Dict]` (handles both ID and search by name)
                *   `async get_channel_videos_data(channel_id: str, max_results: int) -> List[Dict[str, str]]` (returns list of `{'id': 'xxx', 'title': 'yyy'}`)
                *   `async get_single_transcript(video_id: str) -> Optional[str]`
                *   `async download_channel_transcripts_task(job_id: str, videos_data: List[Dict[str, str]], user_id: str, base_dir: str)`: This is the core logic for the background task. It fetches transcripts one by one (can be parallelized internally using `asyncio.gather` for individual `get_single_transcript` calls) and saves them. It updates a shared job status dictionary.
            *   A module-level dictionary `channel_download_jobs = {}` to track the progress of asynchronous channel transcript downloads.

2.  **Dedicated `YouTubeManager` Class:**
    *   **Pros:** Good encapsulation if YouTube interactions become very complex or require managing more internal state (like client instances, job queues). Can be injected as a dependency in FastAPI.
    *   **Cons:** Slightly more boilerplate for the class structure.
    *   **Structure:** Similar methods as above, but as part of a class. The `channel_download_jobs` would be an instance variable.

**Recommendation:**

Let's proceed with **Approach 1 (Service Module with Helper Functions)** for now. It's a straightforward way to decouple the logic from fastapi_retrieve.py and can be evolved into a class later if needed. The key is to make the functions in `youtube_service.py` `async` where appropriate to leverage FastAPI's async capabilities and use `asyncio.to_thread` for blocking calls within those async functions.

**Key Functionalities and How They'll Be Implemented:**

*   **Video Info (`/video-info`):**
    *   Endpoint calls `youtube_service.extract_youtube_id()` then `youtube_service.get_video_info()`.
*   **Single Video Transcript (`/download/transcript`):**
    *   Endpoint calls `youtube_service.extract_youtube_id()`, then `youtube_service.get_single_transcript()`.
    *   The transcript text is returned. For file download, the endpoint can save it to a temporary file and return a `FileResponse`. This ensures minimal overhead for single, quick downloads.
*   **Channel Info (`/channel/{channel_name}`):**
    *   Endpoint calls `youtube_service.get_channel_info()`.
*   **Channel Transcripts (Async Download):**
    *   **Start Download (`/channel/download/async`):**
        1.  The endpoint receives `channel_name` and `max_results`.
        2.  Calls `youtube_service.get_channel_info()` to resolve `channel_name` to `channel_id`.
        3.  Calls `youtube_service.get_channel_videos_data()` to get a list of video IDs and their titles.
        4.  Generates a unique `job_id` (e.g., using `uuid.uuid4()`).
        5.  Initializes an entry in `youtube_service.channel_download_jobs` for this `job_id` (status: 'processing', total_videos, processed_count: 0, files: []).
        6.  Uses FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` to add `youtube_service.download_channel_transcripts_task(job_id, videos_data, user_id, settings.temp_dir)`.
        7.  Returns the `job_id` to the client.
    *   **Check Status (`/channel/download/status/{job_id}`):**
        1.  Endpoint retrieves the status for the given `job_id` from `youtube_service.channel_download_jobs`.
        2.  Returns progress (e.g., processed_count / total_videos, current status).
    *   **Download Results (`/channel/download/results/{job_id}`):**
        1.  If the job status (from `youtube_service.channel_download_jobs`) is 'completed'.
        2.  Collects all file paths stored in the job's metadata.
        3.  Zips these files (using `zipfile` and `io.BytesIO`).
        4.  Returns the ZIP file as a `FileResponse`.

**Parallelism and Speed:**

*   The `download_channel_transcripts_task` in `youtube_service.py` will be responsible for fetching multiple transcripts. It can use `asyncio.gather` to run multiple `get_single_transcript` calls concurrently, each of which uses `asyncio.to_thread` for the blocking `youtube_transcript_api.fetch()` call. This provides parallelism.
*   Saving files will also be done within these concurrent tasks.

**Configuration and API Keys:**

*   The `youtube_service.py` module will import `settings` from config_v2.py to get API keys, proxy details, and the temporary directory for storing transcripts.

**User Experience (Polling):**

The frontend will:
1.  Call `/channel/download/async` to start the process and get a `job_id`.
2.  Periodically call `/channel/download/status/{job_id}` to get progress updates.
3.  Once the status is 'completed', call `/channel/download/results/{job_id}` to get the ZIP file.

**Next Steps:**

If this overall approach sounds good, the next step would be to start defining the functions within the new `youtube_service.py` module and then refactoring the endpoints in transcript_api.py to use this new service layer.

Do you have any questions about this proposed structure or any specific concerns before we would (theoretically) proceed to implementation details? For example, how detailed should the progress reporting be (e.g., just count, or list of videos processed so far)?

Perfect. The approach sounds good. Start creating it and editing everything needed. If you need to clarify anything just ask. Later on we will adjust anything needed.
