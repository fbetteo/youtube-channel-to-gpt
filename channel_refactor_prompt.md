I started editing with 4.1 but got much better results actually moving forward with Claude sonnet 3.7

You, a great software developer and data scientist, will help me set up this API I need for my youtube transcript downloader.

<context>
short_videos = (
                youtube.search()
                .list(
                    part="snippet",
                    channelId=channel_id,
                    type="video",
                    videoDuration="short",
                    order="date",
                )
                .execute()

        and the one for medium and long videos are returning just 5 videos because of the default of max_results. On top of that there is pagination in case we go over that limit. I need to download all the videos

Currently in the frontend I select a channel and it returns the channel info (using this backend)
Then we can select to download all transcripts and the channel/download/async is called but I'm having the issue above of not downloading all videos because of the max_results.
    </context>
    
<instructions>
We need to think deeply about this topic.
1) Is it possible to return all the videos (after pagination and fixing all the max_results thing) and sending first, before downloading, that list to the frontend so the user can see in a table all the video names, duration, id and any other relevant info and then they can select which to download? All would be selected by default but the user would be able to deselect

2) Then could we send the selected video ids back to the backend and start the download there? using only the ids provided by the front end.

3) any drawbacks? any issue you see on this? think and go step by step through the changes that would be needed. 

4) Don't code yet. Give a plan for the next developer.

Absolutely, this is a common and robust pattern for YouTube data workflows. Here’s a step-by-step plan and analysis for your scenario:

1. Returning All Videos (with Pagination) for User Selection
Current Limitation:

The YouTube Data API’s search().list() defaults to maxResults=5 and has a hard limit of 50 per request.
For channels with more videos, you must paginate using the nextPageToken parameter until all videos are fetched.
Proposed Solution:

Implement a function that paginates through all results for each duration category (short, medium, long), collecting all videos.
Aggregate all unique videos (deduplicate by video ID).
Return a list of all videos (with metadata: id, title, duration, etc.) to the frontend.
Frontend:

Display the full list in a table with checkboxes (all selected by default).
Allow the user to deselect any videos they don’t want to download.
2. Sending Selected Video IDs for Download
Workflow:

After user selection, send only the selected video IDs (and any other needed info) to the backend via a new or updated endpoint.
Backend receives the list of IDs and processes only those for transcript download.
3. Drawbacks & Considerations
API Quotas:

Fetching all videos for large channels can require many API calls (quota usage).
Consider caching results or limiting the number of videos fetched for very large channels.
Performance:

Initial fetch may take several seconds for channels with hundreds/thousands of videos.
Consider backgrounding the fetch and providing progress feedback to the user.
Data Consistency:

There may be a delay between fetching the list and starting downloads (videos could be deleted/unavailable in the meantime).
User Experience:

For very large channels, consider paginating the frontend table or providing search/filter options.
Security:

Validate that the video IDs sent for download actually belong to the channel (to prevent abuse).
4. Step-by-Step Plan for the Next Developer
Backend Changes
Implement Full Pagination:

Update get_channel_videos to fetch all videos for each duration, handling nextPageToken until all are collected.
Aggregate and deduplicate videos.
Return Full Video List:

Update the /channel/{channel_name}/videos endpoint to return all videos with relevant metadata (id, title, duration, etc.).
Accept Video IDs for Download:

Create a new endpoint (e.g., /channel/download/selected) or update the existing /channel/download/async to accept a list of video IDs.
Validate the IDs and start transcript download only for those.
Frontend Changes
Display Video List:

Show all videos in a selectable table (checkboxes, all selected by default).
Allow user to deselect videos.
Send Selected IDs:

On user confirmation, send the selected video IDs to the backend for processing.
Other Considerations
(Optional) Caching:

Cache video lists for channels to avoid repeated API calls.
(Optional) Progress Feedback:

Provide progress indicators for both fetching video lists and downloading transcripts.
Summary Table:

Step	Area	Change/Action
1	Backend	Implement full pagination for video fetching
2	Backend	Return all video metadata to frontend
3	Backend	Accept list of video IDs for transcript download
4	Frontend	Display selectable video list (all selected by default)
5	Frontend	Send selected video IDs to backend
6	Optional	Implement caching and progress feedback
No major drawbacks if you handle API quotas and performance. This pattern is scalable, user-friendly, and flexible for future features (e.g., filtering, batch actions).
